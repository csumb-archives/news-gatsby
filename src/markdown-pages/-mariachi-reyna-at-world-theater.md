<h3>All-female group visits April 30, May 1</h3><p>In a musical genre dominated by men, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles has been breaking stereotypes and shaping new cultural traditions since 1994.
</p><p>The 12-member all-female group brings sensitivity, beauty and warmth to Mexico’s musical heritage and has earned a reputation in the industry as a pioneer. Back by pipular demand after thrilling sold-out performances the last three years, Mariachi Reyna will return to CSU Monterey Bay's World Theater for performances on April 30 and May 1. Both shows will start at 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>Now there are other all-female mariachi groups, proving that when maestro Jose Hernandez created Reyna de Los Angeles, it wasn’t a novelty – it was a genre. Reyna has expanded the role of women in mariachi from singers to a full complement of musical performers. In a musical landscape where songs are often written by men and about male perspectives, Reyna has created its own history.
</p><p>“I knew there were enough excellent female musicians to do it, and I didn’t want guys to say, ‘They play like girls,’ ” Hernandez said. “Now guys from other groups come up to me and tell me that they can’t get over how these girls sound so amazing. It’s because they sound like angels, and that’s why they are named after the City of Angeles.”
</p><p>Under Hernandez, the group has released three albums: Solo Tuyo (Yours Only), El Mejor Mariachi Feminino del Mundo (The Best Female Mariachi in the World), and Companeras, which was nominated for Grammy and Latin Grammy awards in 2009.
</p><p>The group will be on stage at the World Theater in time for Cinco de Mayo. The booking wasn’t an accident.
</p><p>“Each year, the World Theater hosts a production commemorating Cinco de Mayo,” said Joe Cardinelli, executive director of university performances and special events.
</p><p>“Besides presenting an evening of memorable music and song, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles’ performance follows our mission to educate and enlighten our campus and local communities through diverse entertainment and performances,” Cardinalli said.
</p><p>Tickets prices: $40 Gold Circle, $29 general admission, with discounts available for senior citizens, students, military and children. They can be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580 or <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">online</a>.
