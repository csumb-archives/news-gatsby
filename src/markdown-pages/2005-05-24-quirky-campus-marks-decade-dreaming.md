It was the spring of 1994. The Cold War was over. The military was
busy boarding up barracks and yanking troops out of Fort Ord near
Monterey when a brain trust of more than 150 educators from around
the state arrived in buses. They were charged with helping create
&quot;a 21st century university on the isolated, fog-shrouded
base.<br>
