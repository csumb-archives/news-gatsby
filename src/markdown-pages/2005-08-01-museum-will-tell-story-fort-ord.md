Things have been piling up in Steven Levinson&apos;s garage. It&apos;s full
of memorabilia such as uniforms, phone books and photographs from
the former U.S. Army base at Fort Ord. &quot;We&apos;re hoping to have a
museum dedicated to Fort Ord, which has had an important role in
the development of Monterey County,&quot; said Levinson, co-director of
the archives and a Teledramatic Arts and Technology
professor.<br>
