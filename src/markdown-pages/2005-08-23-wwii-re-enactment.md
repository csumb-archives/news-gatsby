<h4>Re-enactors bring World War II battle to Fort Ord</h4>
<p>Blink your eyes and Fort Ord suddenly becomes a German town on
the Belgian border during World War II.</p>
<p>Blink again and it&apos;s September 1944, and an American patrol has
entered Nazi Germany southwest of the ancient city of Aachen. Three
months after the landing at Normandy, the Allies are finally within
reach of the enemy on his home turf. Among the troops there is even
talk of getting home for Christmas. What follows, though, is one of
the most grueling campaigns of the war - a terrible struggle across
the Siegfried Line, Hitler&apos;s vaunted West Wall.</p>
<p>That&apos;s the scenario as the World War II Research and
Preservation Society comes to Seaside on the Monterey Peninsula the
weekend of Sept. 10.</p>
<p>Approximately 150 re-enactors representing American, British and
German troops are expected, along with a variety of tanks,
motorcycles and other military vehicles.</p>
<p>History is brought to life by the careful authenticity the
re-enactors demonstrate in their uniforms, style of weapons and
battle tactics. Proper field gear and equipment are required -
right down to period food containers.</p>
<p>While the re-enactors will set up camp on Friday, the public is
invited to view the battle at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 10.
Spectators may park on the lot located at Fifth Street and Third
Avenue and purchase tickets there. They will be escorted in groups
a short distance to the battle site. Spectators are asked to
purchase tickets by 2 p.m. After the battle, the public will be
allowed to tour the battle sites, defensive positions and bivouac
area.</p>
<p>The World War II Research and Preservation Society (WWII RPS) is
a California non-profit organization that has been active in
historical research and living history re-enacting for over a
decade. Members come from all walks of life, including current and
retired military members, police officers, students, doctors,
lawyers and business executives. All have a passion for World War
II history and share a common goal of preserving our nation&apos;s part
in that war.</p>
<p>The WWIIRPS is comprised of member &quot;units&quot; that are based on
actual World War II units. Extensive historical research goes into
the study of these units, their equipment, uniforms, leadership,
and tactical significance on the battlefield. The group maintains
exacting standards of authenticity and a tremendous amount of
effort and resources go into building an individual soldier&apos;s
&quot;impression,&quot; which can take years to perfect.</p>
<p>The Fort Ord Alumni Association sponsors the event. Since its
inception in 1996, the association has awarded 57 scholarships to
CSU-Monterey Bay students. The group also promotes the historic
preservation of the military presence on the Monterey Peninsula.
Members include, but are not limited to, former soldiers and
personnel stationed at Fort Ord.</p>
