<p><strong>Earthbound Farm brings organic produce into campus food
service</strong></p>
<p><br>
Menus have taken on a whole new flavor at CSUMB since an effort to
bring organic food to campus got cooking. The school&apos;s dining
facilities, which are operated by Sodexho, serve more than 2,400
meals a day - about 57,600 meals per year. Starting this semester,
some of those meals are made from organic produce grown by a local
business, Earthbound Farm.</br></p>
<p>The school has long purchased produce from local growers - 17 of
21 campus&apos;s food service suppliers are from the surrounding area.
But the partnership with Earthbound Farm marks the school&apos;s first
venture into organics.</p>
<p>The food service operation also serves coffee from Santa Cruz
Roasting Co. and buys baked goods from Cypress Baking - all part of
its effort to support local businesses. No one can say definitively
whether local-food projects help students avoid the infamous
&quot;freshman 15,&quot; but they do offer a fun, creative way to diversify
and provide healthier and tastier foods in the dining halls.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen a groundswell of student interest in
local and organic food in college and university campuses across
the country. The Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported
that about 200 institutions in the United States have
farm-to-college programs; half were started in the last five
years.</p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s Farm to School Partnership, based at the Watershed
Institute, was a lead player in the Sodexho-Earthbound Farm
contract, responding to requests from students for organic, local
foods.</p>
<p>Campus food service providers face significant challenges. They
have to offer food choices that are appealing and healthful, while
catering to a variety of food preferences and do it all on a
limited budget. Farm-to-college programs, organics, and
locally-produced foods can help them meet those challenges with
great success. &quot;We have been trying to move toward organics, but
until recently the market was minimal and the cost was high,&quot; said
Dan Kaupie, head of food service for Sodexho at CSUMB. &quot;The demand
is increasing across the market, which has improved availability
and made the prices much more competitive.&quot;</p>
<p>Founded on two acres in Carmel Valley more than 21 years ago,
Earthbound Farm is now one of the largest growers of organic
produce in the world and uniquely capable of meeting the year-round
demand for the wide variety of organic produce needed by the
Sodexho operation at CSUMB to make the program truly viable.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&apos;s dining facilities will use Earthbound Farm organic salad
greens, vegetables and fruits in various menu items, as well as
offering a variety of Earthbound Farm&apos;s conveniently packaged
organic &quot;Grab &amp; Go&quot; items such as salads with dressings and
toppings, apple slices, carrot dippers and raisins.</br></br></p>
<p>&quot;This partnership between CSUMB and Earthbound Farm to bring
fresh and delicious organic produce onto the university campus is
extremely gratifying,&quot; said Myra Goodman, co-founder of Earthbound
Farm. &quot;Since my husband Drew and I started Earthbound Farm more
than 21 years ago, our passion has been to bring the benefits of
organic food to as many people as possible and serve as a catalyst
for positive change. It&apos;s exciting to be able to bring these
students organic produce, while simultaneously creating an
opportunity for them to learn the importance of choosing fresh,
unprocessed and sustainably produced food. Historically, &apos;dorm
food&apos; has not been known for its healthfulness or deliciousness and
we&apos;re eager to help change both that perception and reality.&quot;</p>
