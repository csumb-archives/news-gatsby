<p>At 1,365 acres and more than 5,000 residents, CSUMB is its own
small city. To keep that city safe, the University Police
Department has 14 officers, including the newest member of the
force, Daniel Andrada, who was sworn in Aug. 22.</p>
<p>CSUMB President Diane Cordero de Noriega, Vice President for
Administration and Finance Dan Johnson, several members of the
Marina Police Department, and members of Andrada&apos;s family were on
hand to witness the swearing-in ceremony.<img height="242" alt="UPD Chief Fred Hardee welcomes new member of the department Adrian Andrada" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/DanielUPDb.jpg" width="288"/></p>
<p>&quot;As you know, I have a soft spot in my heart for law
enforcement. My husband had a long career in law enforcement. My
father spent 30 years in law enforcement at UC-Santa Barbara. I
have appreciation for what you do. You make this a better place,&quot;
President Cordero de Noriega told the officers in attendance.</p>
<p>The event included a promotion ceremony for long-time UPD
sergeant Earl Lawson, who joins Jay McTaggert as a lieutenant.</p>
<p>Andrada, a native of Salinas and a lifelong resident of the
city, recently graduated from the Police Academy at Monterey
Peninsula College.</p>
<p>Lawson is a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, where he majored in
sociology, then worked as a police officer there before coming to
CSUMB in January 1995.</p>
<p>Members of the UPD are fully trained, sworn peace officers and
most have prior law enforcement experience. They routinely deal
with things that many police never see - students who are
experiencing emotional crises, for instance. They are more apt to
educate students than to arrest them. They are an important part of
the university community, participating in student orientation,
working with the staff members in residential life, giving
workshops on personal safety and other topics. Nine of the 14 are
graduates of various CSU campuses, and four are alums of CSUMB --
two of that quartet started as &quot;campus service officers,&quot; that is,
students who work for the university&apos;s police department as a
part-time job. Three of the officers, including Andrada, speak
Spanish.</p>
<p>And all are there to help.</p>
