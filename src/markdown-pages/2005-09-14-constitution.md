Campus marks Constitution Day
<p>How often do university students, grade-school children, federal
office workers and CIA agents all receive a lesson on the same
topic?</p>
<p>Not often, but that&apos;s what is going to happen later this
month.</p>
<p>The lesson will cover the U.S. Constitution, courtesy of a new
law sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). An appropriations bill
approved by Congress last year contained a requirement that every
school or university that receives federal money present a program
on the Constitution. The law also requires that each of the nearly
two million federal workers receive educational materials about the
charter on Constitution Day, a day celebrating the Sept. 17, 1787,
signing.</p>
<p>If the day falls on a weekend, as it does this year, schools can
celebrate it the week before or the week after.</p>
<p>CSUMB will implement the law on Sept. 19 with a panel discussion
about the relationship between the Constitution and the
confirmation process of a Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>Former Congressman Leon Panetta will moderate the discussion.
Participants include Congressman Sam Farr, Assemblyman Simon
Salinas, local attorney and civil liberties activist Michelle Welsh
and Judge Marla Anderson.</p>
<p>The event will be held from 6 to 7:30 p.m. in the University
Center and is open to the public.</p>
<p>According to published reports, Sen. Byrd was motivated to
introduce the law by surveys showing that many Americans have a
better understanding of the intricacies of &quot;American Idol&quot; than
they do about the foundations of their government.</p>
