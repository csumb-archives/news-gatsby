<p>The map of Mexico is dotted with their strange sounding names.
Palenque. Chichen Itza. Uxmal. Merida. The mystery and grandeur of
these Mayan ruins have beckoned travelers for centuries.</p>
<p>Mayan cities appeared on the Yucatan Peninsula 3,000 years ago.
The Mayans built a culture that flowered while Europe languished in
the Dark Ages and that survived six times as long as the Roman
Empire. They erected more cities than ancient Egypt. They lived by
a calendar equal to that of the modern world, developed the concept
of zero in mathematics, predicted eclipses of the sun and the moon
and traced the path of Venus.</p>
<p>Now everyone can visit the Mayan sites and conduct field
exploration on the Yucatan Peninsula with Mesoamerican
archaeologist Ruben Mendoza. Dr. Mendoza, a professor at California
State University, Monterey Bay, will lead a Lost Cities of the
Ancient Maya tour Jan. 2-16, 2006, open to the public.</p>
<p>The trip costs $2,995 and includes airfare from San Francisco to
Mexico City and back; accommodations for 14 nights; breakfast daily
and several lunches and dinners; private coach for touring and
guided visits and excursions. University credit is available for an
additional cost.</p>
<p>The registration deadline is Oct. 14. A $250 deposit is required
by that date, payable to Intrax Education Abroad. For information
on payment, contact Mickie White, 800-777-7766, ext. 514.</p>
