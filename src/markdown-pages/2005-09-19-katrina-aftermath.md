<p>When Est&#xE9;e Blancher came to CSUMB in the spring of 2002, she
knew that her New Orleans roots would one day be the focus of the
filmmaking skills she hoped to acquire as a student in the
Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology. She wanted to make
a film that would capture the culture of her hometown, its stories
and the personalities who populate the place.</p>
<p>Then Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in the heart of the
Mississippi River Delta, and everything changed for her.</p>
<p>On Sept. 18, the 29-year old junior packed up a bus with
filmmaking equipment and aid supplies and headed to Louisiana to
document the devastation, and to help in any way she could.</p>
<p>&quot;This fits in with my studies,&quot; said Blancher, who will earn six
credits making her documentary. &quot;I couldn&apos;t finish my semester and
be 100 percent here, anyhow, given everything that&apos;s happened. And
I&apos;ve always wanted to document my culture and these stories.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it&apos;ll be an educational piece and an emotional journey,&quot;
she said a few days before her departure.</p>
<p>&quot;The people are tired and traumatized, and they really need
help. I love my home, obviously. Anyone who&apos;s from that area is
heartbroken.&quot;</p>
<p>Blancher plans to document the stories of the people who have
been affected by the hurricane. She&apos;s eager to learn what&apos;s next
for them -- will they abandon the city, or stay and try to
rebuild.</p>
<p>According to Steven Levinson, one of Estee&apos;s teachers, &quot;She&apos;s
expanding her teledramatic skills and serving the community.&quot; He
added that her personal connection will allow her to document
people&apos;s lives in a way that an outsider couldn&apos;t. &quot;She&apos;ll have
people opening up to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Blancher traveled with a crew of six: friends, professional
documentary filmmakers, and a freelance journalist. She plans to
update her website (<a href="http://www.filmkatrina.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.filmkatrina.com</a>) with progress
reports.</p>
