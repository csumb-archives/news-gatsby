<p>The California State University Board of Trustees will begin the
search this month for a new president of California State
University, Monterey Bay to succeed interim President Diane Cordero
de Noriega.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the search committee will be held from 8 to
9:30 a.m. Thursday, Sept. 29, in the Alumni &amp; Visitors Center
(Building 97), on the campus. This is the first and only meeting of
the committee that is an open meeting.</p>
<p>Under the CSU Board of Trustees&apos; presidential selection policy,
adopted in 1997, the chair of the board establishes a five-person
Trustees&apos; Committee for the Selection of the President, which is
composed of the chair of the board, the chancellor and three
trustees, one of whom is designated as committee chair by the board
chair.</p>
<p>Board policy also requires the chair to appoint an advisory
group to the trustees&apos; committee. The Advisory Committee to the
Trustees&apos; Committee for the Selection of the President is composed
of representatives of the faculty, staff, students and alumni, as
well as a member of the campus advisory board, all of whom are
selected by the campus constituent groups. Also on the advisory
committee are a vice president or academic dean from the campus,
and a president of another CSU campus, both selected by the
chancellor. Both committees function as one group.</p>
<p>Trustee Roberta Achtenberg will chair the Trustees&apos; Committee
for the Selection of the President. The other trustee members are
George Gowgani and Bill Hauck, plus CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed
and Trustee Chair Murray Galinson. The latter two are ex-officio to
the committee.<br>
<br>
Members of the Advisory Committee for the Selection of the
President include faculty members Amalia Mesa-Bains, director and
professor of visual and public art; Daniel Fernandez, chair,
Academic Senate; and Steve Watkins, coordinator of technology
development in the university library. Greg Riley, president, CSUMB
Alumni Association, will represent the alumni; Ren Herring,
president, Associated Students, will represent the students; and
Petra Valenzuela, an academic scheduler, will represent the campus
staff. Others on the committee are community members Bob Antle and
Robert C. Taylor, Jr.; Tom Gray from the President&apos;s Advisory
Council; Marsha Moroh, CSUMB interim provost and San Francisco
State University President Bob Corrigan.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this initial meeting is to discuss the role of the
committee, set the schedule of meetings, review the descriptions of
the campus and the presidential position, and discuss any other
business related to the search process.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The committee will work over the next several months reviewing
applications and will conduct interviews with semi-finalists. It is
expected that the finalists will make public visits to the campus
in the spring. The Board of Trustees most likely will select a new
president in March 2006.</p>
<p>President Cordero de Noriega will stay on as president until a
new president is selected and in place. She took the place of
former President Peter Smith, who accepted a position with UNESCO
this past summer.</p>
