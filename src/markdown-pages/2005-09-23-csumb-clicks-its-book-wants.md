The librarians at California State University, Monterey Bay have
found an innovative way to build the school&apos;s collection. It&apos;s
called Amazon.com. The popular online retailer offers &quot;Wish List&quot;
gift registries, which allow users to view items a customer would
like to receive. The school&apos;s alumni relations team saw this as the
perfect opportunity to enlist graduates&apos; support for the new
Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.<br>
