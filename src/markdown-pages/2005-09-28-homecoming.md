<h4>First-ever homecoming game set for Oct. 8</h4>
<p>Every fall, college campuses across the nation invite their
alumni back for celebrations of their alma mater. It&apos;s a time to
acknowledge the success of the schools and their graduates.</p>
<p>From Oct. 5 through 8, CSUMB will celebrate homecoming with a
parade, a bonfire, dances, and the big game. This is the first time
CSUMB has held homecoming - which means school traditions will be
formed on the spot.</p>
<p>As is customary with CSUMB, things will be done a little
differently here. Instead of fancy parade floats, shopping carts
decorated by student and alumni organizations will roll from the
main quad to a pre-game barbeque. The traditional homecoming dance
will raise money to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. And the
&quot;big game&quot; will feature the Otter volleyball squad taking on CSU
Stanislaus at 7 p.m., Oct. 8 at the Otter Sports Center.</p>
<p>Homecoming events are open to alumni, students, faculty, staff
and the community. Events kick off on Oct. 5 with a pep rally for
Otter sports teams, and conclude on Oct. 8. A complete list of
events can be found at <a href="http://csumb.edu/homecoming" rel="nofollow">http://csumb.edu/homecoming</a>.</p>
