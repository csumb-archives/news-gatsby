A very small election has produced very important results for
CSU-Monterey Bay staff members and local government employees. The
17 people who voted unanimously gave university officials the
ability to move forward with plans to build below-market-rate
housing with the knowledge that the development fees on the units
will be drastically lower than regular residential development fees
charged by the Fort Ord Reuse Authority.<br>
