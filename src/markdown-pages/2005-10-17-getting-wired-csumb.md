While a recent survey published by Intel Corp. ranked CSU-Monterey
Bay 12th among the top 50 most unwired U.S. campuses, the college
has its own response to that. &quot;We have 20 projects with 28 faculty
that will leave you flabbergasted,&quot; said Arlene Krebs, founding
director of the school&apos;s Wireless Education and Technology
Center.<br>
