<p>The Salinas City Council will honor CSUMB&apos;s Return of the
Natives Restoration Education Project at a council meeting on Oct.
18, as part of Make a Difference Day.<br>
<br>
The Return of the Natives (RON) project is a community- and
school-based environmental education program dedicated to involving
students (kindergarten through university) in habitat restoration
and service learning projects in the schoolyard and the
community.<br>
<br>
The project&apos;s environmental goal is to protect the waters of the
Monterey Bay through restoration of the waterways and the lands
draining in the bay; its social goal is to bring people and nature
together on restoration and garden projects in the watersheds of
the Monterey Bay from the Monterey Peninsula to North Monterey
County and from Salinas to San Ardo.<br>
<br>
RON has involved students of all ages in creek restoration, tree
planting and clearing invasive weeds in Salinas since 1994. &quot;We are
working for nature and for open space,&quot; said Laura Lee Lienk,
director of the project. &quot;We view ourselves as being a part of the
solution for violence, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
The program will be honored at 4 p.m. on Oct. 18 in the council
chambers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
