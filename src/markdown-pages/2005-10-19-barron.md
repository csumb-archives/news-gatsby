<h5>Pianist Kenny Barron lectures at CSUMB Nov. 3</h5>
<p>Kenny Barron&apos;s unmatched ability to mesmerize audiences with his
elegant playing, sensitive melodies and infectious rhythms inspired
the Los Angeles Times to name him &quot;one of the top jazz pianists in
the world.&quot; Jazz Weekly has called him &quot;The most lyrical piano
player of our time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Barron will give a lecture-demonstration at California State
University, Monterey Bay from 10 a.m. to noon on Thursday, Nov. 3
in the Music Hall, Bldg. 30, on Sixth Avenue. The &quot;concert&quot; is free
and open to the public. Parking will be free in lots 29 and
30.<br>
<br>
Ray Drummond, CSUMB faculty member and well-known bassist, will sit
in on several pieces.<br>
<br>
Much admired for his capacity to extract lovely tonal sounds from
the piano, Mr. Barron also knows how to deliver up-tempo
improvisations with grace, elegance and a powerful sense of swing -
all of which will be on display at the Nov. 3
lecture-demonstration.<br>
