<p><strong>Students raise $3,500 for hurricane relief</strong></p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina&apos;s devastation was felt on campus as students,
faculty and staff watched and listened helplessly as the story
unfolded on TV.</p>
<p>In response to the disaster, the CSUMB student government has
held a variety of fundraising activities to benefit the victims. So
far, approximately $3,500 has been raised.</p>
<p>For example, students who bought tickets to the recent
homecoming dance had the option of giving their $5 admission price
back to the student government association to be used for future
events and programs, or to donate the money for Hurricane Katrina
relief. The overwhelming response from students was to donate their
money. Donations to the relief fund totaled $3,000.</p>
<p>Other fund-raising activities:</p>
<p>&#x2022; The student government&apos;s Environmental Committee continues to
hold bi-weekly recycling drives. More than $100 has been raised so
far.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The United Student Leadership Council -- a group of students
representing student government and a variety of clubs and
organizations on campus -- held a door-to-door solicitation
campaign that resulted in another $373.</p>
<p>Students will be surveyed to determine which organization will
receive the money collected.</p>
