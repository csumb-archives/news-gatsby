<h5>CSUMB&apos;s first newly constructed building wins merit award</h5>
<p>The elemental mixture of wood, glass and masonry that makes up
the exterior of the Chapman Science Academic Center has drawn
notice from architects since it opened in the fall of 2003. Now,
the building has been honored with an award.<br>
<br>
The Concrete Masonry Association of California and Nevada recently
honored the first new building on the CSUMB campus with a Merit
Award. A jury of five architects from across the country judged the
entries, which included 25 in the education category.<br>
<br>
The 68,000-square-foot building was chosen because of the
integration of sustainable materials and because of the building&apos;s
functional design. The building is also cited as a successful and
important first step toward realizing the master plan for the
future design of the campus.<br>
<br>
In making the award, the judges said, &quot;the selection of building
materials, application of color and use of native landscape
elements are all cues in setting a new visual identity for the
campus . . . Reflecting the nature of the environmental science
curriculum, the building embodies a strong commitment to
sustainable design and construction practices.&quot;<br>
<br>
Project architect was the firm of Anshen + Allen of San Francisco.
Masonry contractor was O&apos;Neal Masonry Partners.<br>
<br>
The building was named for Patricia and Robert Chapman, Salinas
residents and community leaders who donated $2.5 million toward the
cost of construction.<br>
