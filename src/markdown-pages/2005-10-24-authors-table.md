<h5>Author&apos;s Table brings together best-selling writers<br>
and their fans at dinner gatherings</br></h5>
<p>Dinner, conversation and books are on the menu for &quot;The Author&apos;s
Table,&quot; and the combination is bringing back the literary
fund-raiser for its fourth year.</p>
<p>CSUMB and the National Steinbeck Center are collaborating to
raise money for each organization&apos;s reading program by putting
together best-selling authors and their fans at intimate
dinners.</p>
<p>Fourteen dinner parties at private homes around the Monterey Bay
and Salinas will be held on Nov. 7, each featuring an author as the
main attraction, in addition to lavish dinner for a small group
(ranging from 10 to 24 guests).</p>
<p>Platinum tickets are $500 per person and include first choice of
dinner as well as an invitation to the opening reception honoring
the authors and hosts at the National Steinbeck Center on Nov. 6.
Gold tickets are $300 each and include first, second or third
choice of dinner locales. Silver tickets are $150 and include one
of six choices of dinner, in order of preference. Tickets may be
purchased by calling (831) 625-8190.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s event chair is Paula Downing.</p>
<p>The lineup of authors includes several best-selling writers of
fiction and non-fiction, an Edgar Award winner, an O. Henry Prize
winner, and the winner of a New York Times Notable Book award. This
year&apos;s honored author&apos;s include:</p>

in the 1964 film &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; an adventure that changed

book detailing her experiences making the movie, and in 2001, she
released her second book, &quot;Letters to Liesl.&quot; This year marks the
