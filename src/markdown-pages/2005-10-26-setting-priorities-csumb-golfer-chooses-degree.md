Even at her worst, Katy Murphy was CSU-Monterey Bay&apos;s best. For the
past three years, the senior golfer who hails from Santa Cruz has
been the Otters&apos; No. 1 player and is one of only two golfers in
school history to take medalist honors in a tournament. But she cut
back on her schedule this year, playing in only two tournaments, to
concentrate on finishing her degree in December.<br>
