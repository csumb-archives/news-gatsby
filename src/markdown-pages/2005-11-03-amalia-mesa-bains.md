<p><strong>Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains to participate in Kahlo
conference</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains, co-chair of the Department of Visual and
Public Art at CSUMB, has been invited to London to participate in a
conference on Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.</p>
<p>The Tate Modern -- one of four galleries that display selections
from the Tate Collection -- will host the event Sept. 30 and Oct. 1
in conjunction with a major exhibit of Kahlo&apos;s work that has been
on display there this summer.</p>
<p>Kahlo (1907-1954) is now regarded as one of the most significant
artists of the 20th century. Her identity, seen through her art and
life, resonates powerfully throughout contemporary culture. She has
become an icon for many, as one of the few widely recognized female
artists and as an image of Mexico. Kahlo has had an impact across
fine art, design, film, fashion and cultural theory. The conference
brings together artists, historians and curators from the U.S.,
Mexico and Europe to look at the genealogy and nature of the Kahlo
phenomenon.</p>
<p>Dr. Mesa-Bains is an artist and cultural critic. Her work,
primarily interpretations of traditional Chicano altars, resonates
both in contemporary formal terms and in its ties to her community
and history. As an author of scholarly articles and a nationally
known lecturer on Latino art, she has enhanced understanding of
multiculturalism and reflected major cultural and demographic
shifts in the United States.</p>
<p>Among her many awards is a 1992 Distinguished MacArthur
Fellowship. She is a former commissioner of arts for the city of
San Francisco.</p>
