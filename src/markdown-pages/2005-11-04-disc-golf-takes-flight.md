<p><strong>Tournament set for Nov. 13</strong></p>
<p>The putting greens are bumpy, the &quot;holes&quot; stand five feet above
ground and the fairways are far from manicured.</p>
<p>But the greens fees are normally free and golf shoes aren&apos;t
required.</p>
<p>The disc golf courses at CSUMB won&apos;t remind anyone of Pebble
Beach. But for disc golfers, the 36 holes of the Oaks and Cypress
courses are magical.</p>
<p>The university&apos;s Disc Golf Club invites the public to learn
about the sport, try out the par-54 courses, and raise money for
the victims of Hurricane Katrina all at the same time.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, the club will hold a tournament and &quot;seminar,&quot;
co-sponsored by the Pro Disc Golf Association. The tournament will
be open to players of all levels, from beginners through
professionals.</p>
<p>Tournament sign-ups begin at 7 a.m., with tee-off time at 8:30.
Course length for the tournament is 27 holes. Entry fee is $20 for
beginners, and a sliding scale up for higher-ranking players. A
free lunch will be provided to the first 75 competitors who sign
up.</p>
<p>A tournament for students only will begin at 10 a.m.; CSUMB
students play for free.</p>
<p>Competitors should meet at the Meeting Hall, Building 98, at the
corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and First Street. The best
places to park are lots 18 or 80, and be sure to bring six quarters
to pay the $1.50 on-campus parking fee. A map of the campus can be
found <a href="http://csumb.edu/general/campus_map/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The seminar starts at noon, and is free (for location report to
building 98). Nate Doss, 2005 PDGA world champion, will offer
pointers and demonstrate play techniques. Members of the CSUMB Disc
Golf Club and the Monterey Stinging Jellies, a local club, will
talk about the courses on campus as well as other places to play in
the Monterey region, and places to buy discs.</p>
<p>Following the seminar, the top competitors from the tournament
will stage a nine-hole &quot;showcase.&quot;</p>
<p>All players&apos; fees go directly to Hurricane Katrina relief.</p>
