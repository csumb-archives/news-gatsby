<h5>CSUMB program to facilitate planning for Soledad Street</h5>
<p>Soledad Street in the former Chinatown area of Salinas is the
site of vacant lots, abandoned buildings and makeshift shelters for
the homeless. It&apos;s full of broken windows and broken dreams. The
area has been neglected for years, despite the fact that it&apos;s
located only a few blocks from the National Steinbeck Center, the
crown jewel in Salinas&apos; redevelopment efforts.</p>
<p>As the result of a longtime relationship between the Franciscan
Workers of Junipero Serra - who run Dorothy&apos;s Place Hospitality
Center on Soledad Street - and CSUMB&apos;s Service Learning program,
that may change.</p>
<p>Dorothy&apos;s Place provides meals for the poor and the homeless.
Begun when its director, Robert Smith, distributed sandwiches from
the back of his car more than 20 years ago, it now serves two meals
a day to hundreds of guests and has provided service-learning
opportunities for CSUMB students for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>When faced with the prospect of losing the lease on Dorothy&apos;s,
Smith approached the university for help in redeveloping the area,
along with the city. The university&apos;s Service Learning Institute
saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>University faculty and staff members applied for federal grant
money to facilitate community planning for lower Soledad Street and
set up job training for the homeless there. The grant was funded --
$600,000 over three years was awarded by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. The money will be a catalyst for
redevelopment in the 20-acre area.</p>
<p>Grant money will pay the salary of a project director who, along
with CSUMB service learning students, faculty and staff, will work
with social service providers, property owners and business owners
to produce a redevelopment plan for the area. The university hopes
to have a plan ready to present to the Salinas City Council in two
to three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m really excited about the possibility of bringing people
together in dialogue . . . to connect social service delivery with
housing, with retail, with education,&quot; said Seth Pollack, director
of service learning at the university.</p>
<p>Grant money will be used to teach work skills and develop
micro-enterprise business opportunities for the homeless. CSUMB
business students will develop income-generating projects; the
possibilities include a bicycle repair business and a used clothing
store.</p>
<p>As part of the project, university students will construct a
40,000-square-foot garden on city-owned property -- with native
plants, flowers and vegetables -- at the corner of Soledad and Lake
streets. Homeless people will be employed as garden assistants.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term - several years - we&apos;ll use the space as a
garden. Ultimately, it will be a site for housing. The goal of the
garden and the job training is to show the property owners in the
area that there can be a connection between them and the folks who
live there now,&quot; said Pollack.</p>
<p>The first order of business is to locate space in the area to
house the project&apos;s administrative office and computer training
classes. Work on the garden and the business plan will start in the
spring.</p>
<p>Two events last spring demonstrated the potential the
partnership between Dorothy&apos;s Place and the university holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The Soupline Forum: Imagining a New Neighborhood On and Around
Soledad Street,&quot; was held on April 29 at the Salinas Buddhist
Temple, facilitated by CSUMB faculty members. Salinas Mayor Anna
Caballero, Assemblyman Simon Salinas and Rick Slone, a Buddhist
priest, made presentations. CSUMB students also presented their
ideas for improving the area.<br>
<br/></br></li>
<li>A community day of labor was held on April 30, when the street,
buildings and vacant lots received a facelift, courtesy of CSUMB
students, staff, and faculty, along with community members and the
guests of Dorothy&apos;s Place. To demonstrate the commitment of CSUMB
to continue its partnership with Dorothy&apos;s Place, a tree was
planted in the courtyard.</li>
