The abandoned buildings, overgrown lots and homeless camps of
Soledad Street sit right in the heart of Salinas, in the old
Chinatown area, just blocks from the Steinbeck Center, the new Maya
Cinemas, and Oldtown&apos;s shops and restaurants. But Soledad Street is
its own world. CSU-Monterey Bay got a three-year $600,000 U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development grant to help
revitalize the area.<br>
