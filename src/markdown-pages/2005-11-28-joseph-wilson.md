<h5>Former Ambassador Joseph Wilson to speak Dec. 6</h5>
<p>Joseph Wilson, former U.S. diplomat and husband of exposed CIA
agent Valerie Plame, will discuss &quot;The Politics of Truth&quot; at 7
p.m., Dec. 6 in the University Center ballroom.</p>
<p>Wilson was called a &quot;true American hero&quot; by former president
George H.W. Bush for his many years of diplomatic service,
including his face-to-face confrontations with Saddam Hussein in
the days leading up to the first Gulf War. He may well have faded
quietly into the sunset had he not written an opinion piece for The
New York Times in which he accused President George W. Bush of
&quot;exaggerating the Iraqi threat&quot; in order to justify war,
specifically with respect to Iraq&apos;s alleged attempts to acquire
uranium from Niger. Shortly thereafter, columnist Robert Novak
noted that Wilson&apos;s wife, Valerie Plame, was a covert CIA
operative, a revelation that was potentially a criminal
offense.</p>
<p>Wilson charged that Plame&apos;s CIA status was deliberately exposed
by Bush administration officials, as retaliation for his public
charge that U.S. intelligence concerning weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq was largely a conspiracy to falsify and
fabricate evidence to support the war.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Wilson&apos;s message - follow your conscience, act ethically
and responsibly, and be faithful to your values - resonates with
our Vision Statement,&quot; said David Anderson, dean of the College of
University Studies and Programs, which is sponsoring the event.
&quot;That&apos;s why we invited him.&quot;</p>
<p>The former ambassador will also sign copies of his book, &quot;The
Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed my
Wife&apos;s CIA Identity.&quot; Copies will be for sale in the UC lobby.</p>
<p>In his book, Wilson details more than two decades of foreign
service, in addition to giving his personal account of the events
leading to his decision to go public with his criticisms of the
Bush administration, and what he views as an orchestrated attack by
administration officials in retaliation for his coming forward.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding Wilson began with President Bush&apos;s
2003 State of the Union Address, in which the President said, &quot;The
British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought
significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson&apos;s editorial, titled &quot;What I Didn&apos;t Find in Africa,&quot; was
published on July 6, 2003. The next day, White House aides said
that the State of the Union Address should not have contained the
reference. And Secretary of State Colin Powell, then traveling with
the president in Africa, gave a news conference addressing the
issue.</p>
<p>President Bush appointed Special Prosecutor Patrick J.
Fitzgerald to determine whether any federal laws had been violated
in the revelation of Plame&apos;s identity. Fitzgerald&apos;s investigation
in turn led to contempt of court charges against Time magazine and
New York Times reporters Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller, for
their refusal to reveal who told them about Plame&apos;s identity.
Cooper eventually testified it was White House political adviser
Karl Rove, while Miller, after 84 days in jail, revealed that her
source was Vice President Dick Cheney&apos;s Chief of Staff, Lewis
&quot;Scooter&quot; Libby. Libby was then indicted on five counts of
obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements.</p>
<p>The bulk of Wilson&apos;s op-ed piece dealt with his trip to Niger in
2002, where he had been sent on behalf of the CIA to investigate
the possibility that Saddam Hussein had attempted to buy enriched
uranium yellow cake. Wilson concluded then that there &quot;was nothing
to the story.&quot;</p>
<p>About &quot;The Politics of Truth&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;This is a riveting and all-engaging book. Not only does it
provide context to yesterday&apos;s headlines, and perhaps tomorrow&apos;s,
about the Iraq war and about our politics of personal destruction,
but former Ambassador Joseph Wilson also tells captivating stories
from his life as a foreign service officer with a long career
fostering the development of African democracies, and gives us a
behind-the-scenes blow-by</p>
