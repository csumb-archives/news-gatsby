<p>Images of stars are popping up around the local area as
publicity posters for First Night&apos;s New Year&apos;s celebration get
distributed. The artwork was produced by a CSUMB graduate (and
current university employee) and is the result of a partnership
between the university and the event&apos;s organizers.</p>
<p>For three years, First Night has worked with CSUMB in a
competition of sorts to develop the art that goes into the buttons,
posters and on the Web to promote the annual New Year&apos;s
festival.</p>
<p>Students in Professor Bobbi Long&apos;s publications workshop find
out what its like to work on a real-world project and First Night
gets high-caliber art that helps define its theme.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the mission statement of First Night is to involve the
community, so it was a perfect partnership,&quot; said Sue Ann Hillyer,
visual arts director for First Night.</p>
<p>The work of Francine Aguirre (who graduated last May) was chosen
to promote this year&apos;s festival. Aguirre, a resident of Salinas, is
now employed as a graphic artist at the university.</p>
<p>Her winning design is dominated by a field of stars on a blue
background, symbolizing this year&apos;s theme of &quot;Night of a Thousand
Stars.&quot;</p>
<p>Each Dec. 31 for more than a decade, the non-profit First Night
has staged an afternoon and evening of visual and performing arts
throughout downtown Monterey to welcome in the new year.</p>
