<h5>Exhibits curated by Museum Studies students</h5>
<p>Work by faculty and staff in the Department of Visual and Public
Art is featured in the newly opened Balfour Brutzman Art Gallery,
located in Building 71.</p>
<p>The inaugural exhibition, &quot;View of VPA,&quot; was curated by
Cristiano Colantoni and Paul Van de Carr, students in the
university&apos;s museum studies program.</p>
<p>The program focuses on the museum&apos;s potential and ethical
responsibility for representing history and culture in a way that
shapes the public&apos;s concept of its values. Students divide their
time between the university setting and internships in local
museums where students learn basic operation skills, conservation
application, exhibit content, design and interpretation.</p>
