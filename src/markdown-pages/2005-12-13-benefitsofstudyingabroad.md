<p>Meghan Lewis&apos; experience as an exchange student in Florence,
Italy, last year not only exposed her to different cultures and
enabled her to make friends in other countries, it also may have
advanced her academic career.</p>
<p>Now back at CSUMB for her senior year, Lewis is preparing for
graduate school and talking about the benefits of international
study.</p>
<p>&quot;It changed my life - that&apos;s why I&apos;m planning to go back. And it
makes you view the United States very differently,&quot; she said in a
recent interview.</p>
<p>Lewis is majoring in Human Communications with an emphasis in
pre-law. In graduate school she plans to study international law
and international relations.</p>
<p>That interest motivated her to investigate opportunities for
overseas study. &quot;There are tons of programs available. Anywhere you
want to go, you can go. But you&apos;ve got to find it yourself. No one
is going to knock on your door.&quot;</p>
<p>The California State University International Programs allow
students to study at campuses in 19 countries and pay the same
tuition they would pay in California. &quot;It ended up being more
expensive for me because, while tuition is the same, rent and food
are more expensive due to the exchange rate,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The school she attended was housed in a villa - &quot;old, run-down
and definitely not glamorous.&quot; It was a CSU campus, not an Italian
university. &quot;I studied European Union politics, Italian literature
- Dante and Machiavelli - and Italian politics.&quot; Her professors
were mostly English-speaking Italians.</p>

She prepared for her year in Florence by taking Italian language
classes and a course in the history of Western Europe at Monterey
Peninsula College during her sophomore year and a class in
comparative government at CSUMB.<br>
<br>
<p>Lewis, a native of Grass Valley who had lived in California her
whole life, was attracted to CSUMB because of its small classes,
its diversity, the Human Communications major and the proximity to
the ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;The university was very helpful and accommodating in working
out the transfer of my credits. I got half my major requirements
out of the way,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>And what was the biggest lesson she learned?</p>
<p>&quot;I learned how to be respectful of other cultures. We traveled a
lot -- we took weekend trips to Germany, France, Ireland, England,
Switzerland, the Netherlands. And we saw lots of Italy. We took the
train, backpacked, stayed in hostels - we didn&apos;t have a lot of
money. I learned some Spanish, French and German. And I learned
that if I made a little effort with their language, it really
pleased people.</p>
<p>&quot;And I also learned that I should explore my backyard -
California.&quot;</p>
<p>Lewis cautioned that overseas study &quot;is not for everyone - you
have to be self-sufficient in order to get out of it what you
should.</p>
<p>&quot;But I loved it. I can&apos;t wait to get back to Italy - and I hope
to go back this summer.&quot;</p>
