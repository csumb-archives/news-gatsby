<p>National recognition, the departure of the university&apos;s founding
president, and the first event sponsored by the new Center for
Reading Diagnosis and Instruction made campus news during
2005.<br>
<br>
CSUMB was one of 20 colleges cited as a model for promoting student
success in the book, Student Success in College: Creating
Conditions that Matter, published by the American Association for
Higher Education. The book called CSUMB &quot;an educationally engaging
university&quot; and added that it &quot;unequivocally honors
diversity.&quot;<br>
<br>
The university&apos;s service learning program was recognized by the
editors of U.S. News &amp; World Report in the magazine&apos;s 2006
edition of America&apos;s Best Colleges. Called &quot;a program to look for,&quot;
service learning was singled out as an &quot;outstanding example of
academic programs that are believed to lead to student
success.&quot;</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>And in a survey conducted by Intel Corp. in conjunction with the
Center for Digital Education, CSUMB was ranked among the top
wireless campuses in the nation. The school is in the forefront of
exploring innovative ways to use this new technology through the
Wireless Education and Technology Center based on campus.</p>
<p>President Peter Smith, who headed the campus through its first
decade, left in June to become the head of education for the United
Nations, the first American to hold the position. Provost Diane
Cordero de Noriega was named interim president and will serve in
that capacity until a permanent replacement is named.</p>
<p>In January, the university received a $2.4 million anonymous
gift to establish a reading center on campus. The center will be
housed in a former Army building that will be renovated in 2006.
Over 100 national leaders in reading, speech-language pathology and
special education gathered on campus in August to explore the
components of effective instructional leadership in language and
reading - the first event sponsored by the new center.</p>
<p>The Alumni and Visitors Center opened in the spring. The ceiling
contains Douglas fir recycled from Army buildings that once
occupied the site - one of many ways the university recognizes the
history of Fort Ord.<br>
<br>
Members of the community were welcomed to lectures by civil rights
lawyer Lani Guinier and environmentalist Jean-Michel Cousteau. Also
visiting campus were United Farm Workers co-founder Dolores Huerta,
social commentator bell hooks, head of the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Julie Packard, former Congressman and Georgetown Law Professor
Father Robert Drinan, ethnic studies professor Ward Churchill and
Ambassador Joseph Wilson.<br>
<br>
The university&apos;s 10 varsity teams completed their first season at
the NCAA Division II level. The men&apos;s basketball team defied
pre-season predictions and finished with a 10-10 record, a
more-than-respectable showing. Just as impressive was the big-game
atmosphere in the gym, where nearly every seat was filled. Players
were recruited, coaches hired and facilities secured for the Otters
baseball and softball teams, which will begin play this spring.
Local resident and former professional player Rich Aldrete will
head the baseball program; Andrea Kenney will coach the softball
team.<br>
<br>
Other highlights include:</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<ul>
<li>Two students displaced by Hurricane Katrina transferred to
CSUMB and were welcomed by the campus community.</li>
<li>An agreement was reached with a university in China for an
exchange of students between the two campuses.</li>
<li>The largest class yet - approximately 700 - participated in
graduation ceremonies before more than 7,500 family members and
friends. Kevin Klose, CEO of National Public Radio, delivered the
commencement address.</li>
<li>Several new programs were added to the curriculum - an
agricultural management concentration in the School of Business; a
bachelor&apos;s degree in human performance and wellness; and a master&apos;s
degree in instructional science and technology.</li>
<li>CSUMB started to offer organic food choices in its dining
facilities, part of a national trend to serve healthier, and
locally grown food.</li>
<li>Planning continued on a new library to be called the Tanimura
and Antle Family Memorial Library, after the Salinas agricultural
families whose generous contributions are helping to fund it.</li>
<li>Work began on a campus-wide telecommunications infrastructure
upgrade - the underground copper wires and fiber optic cables
needed to provide telephone, e-mail and Internet service to campus
buildings. The project is expected to take 18 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the year to come, the campus is expected to get a new
president; break ground for the library; and start construction on
a workforce housing project that was made possible when district
voters approved an exemption from developer fees - allowing the
project to remain &quot;affordable&quot; for faculty, staff and members of
the community. To make way for the new construction, several
hundred Army buildings will be demolished.</p>
