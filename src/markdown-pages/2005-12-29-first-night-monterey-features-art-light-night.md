Bobbi Long, a professor at CSU-Monterey Bay, and her Publications
Design course assume the annual task of designing the imagery for
event materials for First Night. Francine Aguirre, a graduating
senior who now works for the university as a graphic artist, came
up with the winning design: a brilliant moon, its full lips blowing
what must be a thousand bright stars swirling out into a teal night
sky.<br>
