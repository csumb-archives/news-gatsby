The opening scene would probably go like this: A room full of
alumni gather in a university building for a holiday mixer on a
rainy winter evening. Quick cut to an older man in glasses, Santa
hat covering a shaved head. He&apos;s working the room. The man, Steven
Levinson, has organized this holiday shindig for his former pupils,
alumni from the CSU-Monterey Bay Teledramatic Arts and Technology
(TAT) program. If such a movie were to be made, chances are CSUMB&apos;s
TAT students would be involved, producing, directing, editing and
shooting the project.<br>
