When Nancy Perez envisions a special place for teens to gather,
she&apos;s not thinking about what color the walls will be painted or
what kind of furniture it will have. She thinks about what kind of
atmosphere it could have. That&apos;s the type of place also imagined by
Michelle Jones and a group of her fellow students at CSUMB, who
sought grant money to start a coffeehouse for teens in East
Salinas.<br>
