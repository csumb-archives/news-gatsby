Bringing a character to life on stage is complex in iself. Taking
five different characters from five different stories and five
different time periods, well, that&apos;s just crazy talk. But Pacific
Grove playwright Erica Hemenway just doesn&apos;t know any better. &quot;I
started doing it as a character study,&quot; explained Hemenway, a
25-year-old CSUMB graduate who received a degree from the school&apos;s
Teledramatic Arts and Technology program.<br>
