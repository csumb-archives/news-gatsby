California State University, Monterey Bay senior Joan Iguban won&apos;t
be able to attend the Have a Heart dinner and auction Feb. 17.
Instead, the 23-year-old single mother will be studying for classes
and caring for her two young children at their campus apartment.
But she hopes the program goes well. The eighth annual event is the
biggest fund-raiser the university holds for its financial aid
programs. Sixty-five percent of CSUMB&apos;s roughly 3,500 students,
including Iguban, rely on financial aid.<br>
