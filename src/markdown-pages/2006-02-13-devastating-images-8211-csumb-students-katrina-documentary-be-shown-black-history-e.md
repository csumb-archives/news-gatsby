Filmmaker Estee Blancher said she wants viewers to be moved to
tears &#x2013; or at the very least be awestruck &#x2013; by the images of
destruction she captured in New Orleans. Overturned cars, flattened
homes and people rebuilding neighborhoods are some of the images
Blancher captured on her visit to the areas affected by Hurricane
Katrina six months ago.<br>
