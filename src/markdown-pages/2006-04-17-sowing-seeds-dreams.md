Chinatown, long a magnet for drug dealers, prostitutes and the
homeless, is about to undergo a renovation, a much-needed facelift
that could mean extending the life of Dorothy&apos;s Place &#x2013; its lease
is set to expire at the end of the year. With a $600,000 grant
received last year, CSU-Monterey Bay, neighbors and Salinas city
administrators are on the verge of setting in motion a plan to
redevelop the neighborhood, beginning with the creation of the
Soledad Street Community Center and a community garden.<br>
