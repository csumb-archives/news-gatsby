For the past two years of her college career, Sara Bailey has
devoted countless hours to showcasing the music scene at
CSU-Monterey Bay. The 22-year-old has recruited musicians, recorded
them at the university&apos;s studio and produced two discs of their
songs. Bailey is balancing the project with 17 class units and 20
hours of work per week as a student coordinator of the university&apos;s
orientation program. This year&apos;s CD, Out of Order, comes out on
Thursday.<br>
