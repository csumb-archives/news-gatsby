On a small table resting side stage in Building 27 on the
CSU-Monterey Bay campus lay several inanimate objects: a Ziploc bag
filled with rice, a worn air-strike siren, a door hinge, a
boxing-ring bell, a wine glass, a musical chime. Students in the
class are preparing to go old school this week, with the production
of &quot;Bait and Switch,&quot; a live radio drama that will be broadcast at
5 p.m. Saturday on KRXA-540. The show will be performed in front of
a live studio audience in Building 27.<br>
