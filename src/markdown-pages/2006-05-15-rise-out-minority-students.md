Submarines and boat rides around the Monterey Peninsula are what
prompted senior Sonia Padilla to consider a career as a biology
teacher. Until she began participating in the Recruitment in
Science Education (RISE) program at CSU-Monterey Bay, she had no
idea what doors would open for her. Padilla, a senior at North
Salinas High School, is in the first graduating class of the
program aimed at getting more minority students into the
sciences.<br>
