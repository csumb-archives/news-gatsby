Almost a dozen years ago, playwright and director Luis Valdez
believed in the dream of CSU-Monterey Bay. Valdez, who founded El
Teatro Campesino 41 years ago, was one of the 13 founding
professors at the university, and established the teledramatic arts
and technology department. He remains on the faculty as a
professor. Today, he will address students from the university&apos;s
largest graduating class.<br>
