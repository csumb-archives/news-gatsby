Students at California State University, Monterey Bay applied
mathematics to solve a problem involving irrigation of agricultural
fields and won a Meritorious Award &#x2013; the second-highest honor &#x2013; in
a recent international math competition. The award placed them in
the top 15 percent of the nearly 1,000 teams that entered the
competition. Those teams represented more than 500 colleges
worldwide, including Harvard, Oxford, Duke, and universities in
China.<br>
