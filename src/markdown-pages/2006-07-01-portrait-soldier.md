Ghostly as Fort Ord&apos;s deserted barracks on which it&apos;s painted, a
gallery of soldiers&apos; faces gazes into space. Only it is a space
filled with meaning, said Amalia Mesa-Bains, chair of the Visual
and Public Art Department at California State University, Monterey
Bay. &quot;The concept of this project was one of excavating the
geography of memory that lay beneath our feet,&quot; Mesa-Bains said.
&quot;We peopled the (barracks) windows with the living history of the
base.&quot;<br>
