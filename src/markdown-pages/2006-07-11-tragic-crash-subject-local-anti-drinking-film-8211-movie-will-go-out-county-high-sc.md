California State University, Monterey Bay has teamed up with a
Salinas drug- and alcohol-abuse prevention group to produce a short
film about the dangers of binge drinking. The movie, called &quot;Her
Downward Spiral,&quot; is loosely based on the life of a local high
school student, said Eden Estrada, coordinator for Safe Teens
Empowerment Project in Salinas.<br>
