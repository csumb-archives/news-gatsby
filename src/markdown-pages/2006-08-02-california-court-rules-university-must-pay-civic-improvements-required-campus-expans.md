A California Supreme Court ruling that determined that the
California State University System must pay for the environmental
and civic improvements required by a planned expansion of its
Monterey Bay campus has implications for other campuses in the
statewide system. The court&apos;s unanimous ruling requires that all
state agencies pay for local improvements that result from
development, such as new traffic lights, improved roads, or
increased fire equipment. Previously, that burden had fallen on the
locality that would benefit from the infrastructure.<br>
