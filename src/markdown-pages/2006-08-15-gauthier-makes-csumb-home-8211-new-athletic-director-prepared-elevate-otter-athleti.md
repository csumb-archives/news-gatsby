Glancing out the windows of California State University, Monterey
Bay&apos;s Alumni &amp; Visitors Center, Howard Gauthier signed at the
familiarity. &quot;I grew up in a small town that looks quite a bit like
the Monterey Bay area,&quot; said Gauthier, who was named the school&apos;s
director of athletics. &quot;So there&apos;s a high level of comfort in being
here.&quot; Gauthier most recently served as the athletic director at
Division II Southwest Minnesota State University.<br>
