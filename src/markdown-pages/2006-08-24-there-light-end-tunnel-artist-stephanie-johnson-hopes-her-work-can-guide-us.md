Stephanie Anne Johnson was about to graduate from college when she
found the light. A theater major at Boston&apos;s Emerson College in the
mid-1970s, she took a class in lighting design in her next-to-last
semester and discovered the medium that continues to inspire her as
a theatrical lighting designer and artist.&quot;I just loved it,&quot; she
recalled recently as she led a visitor through a tour of her show,
&quot;Stephanie Anne Johnson: Art and Theater, Legacy and Testimony&quot; at
San Francisco&apos;s Sargent Johnson Gallery. &quot;When I graduated, the
first jobs I had were jobs doing lighting design. I became
fascinated with it and just kept working with it,&quot; said the CSUMB
professor of art.<br>
