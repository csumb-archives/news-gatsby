The theme of the World Theater&apos;s Performing Arts Series, set to
begin Sept. 21 on the CSU-Monterey Bay campus is deceiving.
&quot;Welcome to the World!&quot; it calls out from this aptly named
performance center, but introducing international cutting-edge
artists is exactly what it has done for all of its short
existence.<br>
