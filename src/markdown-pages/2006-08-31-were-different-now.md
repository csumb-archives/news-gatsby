California State University, Monterey Bay opened 11 years ago on a
decomissioned Army base. The first students moved in and started
volunteering in surrounding cities. Now we have new development,
new libraries and more enterainment &#x2013; and writer Leslie Escobar
finds the school is just getting started.<br>
