It began three years ago as a Mexican Independence Day celebration,
a social dance where members of a sorority and a fraternity at
CSU-Monterey Bay partied and had a good time. But dancing was not
enough. Last year, for the third annual event, students organized a
conference open to the campus community. This year, Theta Alpha
sorority and Nu Alpha Kappa fraternity put together an El Grito
conference and brought about 70 high school students to campus to
learn about their culture.<br>
