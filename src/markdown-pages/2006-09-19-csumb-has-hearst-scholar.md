If all&apos;s going as planned, California State University, Monterey
Bay senior Adriana Pacheco is driving this morning to Long Beach to
pick up a $3,000 check. Pacheco, 22, will be honored as a recipient
of a William Randolph Hearst/CSU Trustees&apos; Scholarship at the CSU
chancellor&apos;s office. The award, one of 19 given in the
405,000-student system, goes to students who demonstrate academic
success while overcoming socioeconomic hardship.<br>
