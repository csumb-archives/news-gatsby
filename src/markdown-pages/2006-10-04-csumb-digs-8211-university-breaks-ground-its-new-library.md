Officials at California State University, Monterey Bay, celebrated
a groundbreaking for the campus&apos; new library, which will serve as
the school&apos;s most prominent landmark. The $64 million,
136,000-squre-foot Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library
headlines a campus facelift, and the university plans to make it
the visual trademark of publications, merchandising and other
school-branded materials.<br>
