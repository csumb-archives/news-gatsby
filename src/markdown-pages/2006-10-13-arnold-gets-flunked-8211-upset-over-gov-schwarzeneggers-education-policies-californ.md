One of the best attack ads of the fall election season was filmed
in a dorm room and ends with the allegation that Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger eats babies. The ad, starring two CSUMB students,
also makes the more accurate points that Schwarzenegger raised
college tuition and cut teacher tax credits. As for baby eating?
&quot;Dude, we can&apos;t prove that,&quot; one student says in the skit. &quot;Shut
up, it&apos;s an attack ad. I can say whatever I want,&quot; his rage-filled
buddy responds.<br>
