On almost any part of the golf course, Ashley Dickman appears like
any of her teammates on the CSU-Monterey Bay women&apos;s golf team. Her
swing is good, but not great. But with a putter in hand, Dickman is
a whole different golfer. There is a simple reason for that &#x2013; she
caddies at Pebble Beach, where she is the only female and the
youngest caddie.<br>
