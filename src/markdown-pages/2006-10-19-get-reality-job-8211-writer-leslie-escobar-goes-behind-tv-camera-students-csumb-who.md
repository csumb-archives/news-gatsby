It&apos;s hard to turn on the television without being inundated by
reality TV shows. Michelle Riel, director of the Teledramatic Arts
&amp; Technology Department at CSUMB, says dozens of the program&apos;s
graduates have gone on to work on reality shows such as &quot;Project
Runway,&quot; &quot;Blind Date&quot; and &quot;Nanny 911.&quot;<br>
