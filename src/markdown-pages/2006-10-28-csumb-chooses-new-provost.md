Under the tutelage of an adviser at the University of Chicago,
Kathryn Cruz-Uribe learned that animal bones are fascinating.
&quot;Learning about human behavior and bones is fun,&quot; Cruz-Uribe said
via cell phone from Flagstaff, Ariz., where she serves as the dean
of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Northern
Arizona University. In the coming months, she will trade her
responsibilities in Flagstaff for the position of provost and vice
president of academic affairs at CSU-Monterey Bay.<br>
