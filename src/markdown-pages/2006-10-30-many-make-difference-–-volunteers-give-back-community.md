Streets and parks were beautified Saturday as an assortment of
groups volunteered to help in their community for Make a Difference
Day in Salinas. More than 150 volunteers &#x2013; 50 of them CSUMB
students &#x2013; took over Soledad Street in Salinas&apos; Chinatown for five
hours in an effort to beautify a deteriorating part of the city.
Seth Pollack, director of CSUMB&apos;s Service Learning Institute, said
he liked how much the community had come together to work toward a
common goal.<br>
