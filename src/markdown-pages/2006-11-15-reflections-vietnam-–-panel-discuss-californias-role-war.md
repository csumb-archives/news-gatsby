Two visions of Vietnam followed David Anderson, long after he left
that land in 1970. &quot;First, the beauty of Vietnam,&quot; said Anderson,
an Army veteran. &quot;Green rice fields almost to the water&apos;s edge.
White sand beaches. The people so very open and friendly.&quot; Then the
war itself . . . &quot;The trauma and sacrifice of it. It nags at
people,&quot; said Anderson, dean of California State University,
Monterey Bay&apos;s College of University Studies and Programs.<br>
