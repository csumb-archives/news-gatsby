Students at California State University, Monterey Bay have been
holding events this week as part of National Hunger and
Homelessness Awareness Week. The activities are sponsored by the
Student Leadership in Service Learning group and are intended to
bring attention to severe needs among low-income and homeless
populations in Monterey County. The theme of the week is &quot;One
Paycheck Away,&quot; meaning that a significant segment of the workforce
is one paycheck away from losing their homes.<br>
