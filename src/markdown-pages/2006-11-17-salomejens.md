<p>Actress Salome Jens brought the poetry of Anne Sexton to the
World Theater stage with her one-woman performance, About Anne, in
November. The New York Times raved about the play, calling it &quot;a
magnificent moment of theater.&quot;</p>
<p>While on campus, she took the opportunity to share with CSUMB
students the knowledge she&apos;s gained from a lifetime of acting.</p>
<p>Students in the university&apos;s Teledramatic Arts and Technology
Department benefited from a question-and-answer session in which
Jens advised them to &quot;be outrageous when the desire comes. Don&apos;t
sit on it. I&apos;ve had the career I&apos;ve had because of my commitment,
not because I&apos;m special.&quot;</p>
<p>Her long and varied career put her opposite Rock Hudson in
1966&apos;s Seconds and under a heavy layer of makeup as the &quot;Female
Shapeshifter&quot; in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. She&apos;s also had roles
on Melrose Place, MacGuyver, and even appeared in one episode of
Tales from the Crypt. When she isn&apos;t performing, Jens teaches
acting at UCLA and also gives private lessons.</p>
<p>Jens, who developed her craft at the Actor&apos;s Studio, emphasized
the importance of finding the personal in every role to give each
character a subtext. An alcoholic with 25 years of sobriety, she
brings her personal understanding of the disease to the passionate
confessions of Sexton&apos;s poetry.</p>
<p>The chance to address alcoholism - especially in the life of the
artist - is important to Jens. &quot;Through Anne, I can speak to the
issue of alcoholism. It&apos;s important that students have the
awareness as artists to know they need to be well.&quot;</p>
<p>This combined lesson on alcohol awareness and the craft of
acting came through vividly in Jens&apos; workshops and performance.
&quot;What&apos;s wonderful about doing Anne is it gives students the
opportunity to see what we talk about,&quot; says Jens. &quot;They can see
what I&apos;m doing. It&apos;s not just teaching, it&apos;s showing.&quot;</p>
