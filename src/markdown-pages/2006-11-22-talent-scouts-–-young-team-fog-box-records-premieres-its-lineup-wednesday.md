On April 7 of this year, CSUMB&apos;s Music Hall felt like the set of
American Idol. For five hours that day, Sara Bailey, the president
of Fog Box Records and a CSUMB senior, along with her executive
engineer Matt Bollwinkel, watched as a parade of musical acts
applied for a spot on the new local label.Responding to fliers
plastered all over the CSUMB campus and an ad on Craigslist, almost
20 solo artists and bands dropped by to compete for a few coveted
spots.<br>
