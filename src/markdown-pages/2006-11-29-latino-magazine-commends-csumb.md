<h4>Latino magazine commends CSUMB</h4>
<p>CSUMB has been named a &quot;Publisher&apos;s Pick&quot; by Hispanic Outlook In
Higher Education. The magazine compiles a national list of colleges
and universities every year to identify those with solid records in
recruiting, educating and graduating Hispanic students.</p>
<p>The standings are based upon formal and informal inquires as
well as data from the National Center for Education Statistics.</p>
<p>This semester, 27 percent of CSUMB students identify themselves
as Latino/Hispanic/Mexican-American.</p>
<p>Nineteen other California State University campuses also made
the list. The CSU is the most diverse higher education institution
in the nation, with minorities making up more than half of its
identified student body. Hispanics are more than 21 percent of the
total CSU student population. In 2005, the California State
University conferred 57 percent of the state&apos;s bachelor&apos;s degrees
earned by Hispanics.</p>
