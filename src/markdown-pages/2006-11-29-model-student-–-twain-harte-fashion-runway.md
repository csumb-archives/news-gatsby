You can call Twain Harte&apos;s Tyler Birkestrand a model student.
Birkestrand, 22, a student at CSUMB, set out four years ago for
college to study film and TV. But he has since found himself on the
other side of the camera, building a career as a model. The money
he has earned from modeling helped him avoid taking out a student
loan this year.<br>
