A group of students at California State University, Monterey Bay,
is collecting sneakers to donate to impoverished runners around the
world. The One World Running Club started at CSUMB in September
under the leadership of Katie Spotz, who is studying at CSUMB as
part of the National Student Exchange program. Spotz&apos;s home campus
is Kent State University in Ohio. Spotz, 19, said she read about
One World Running, the Colorado-based nonprofit that collects shoes
for Third World countries, in &quot;Runner&apos;s World&quot; magazine. She said
she figured she could do something similar at CSUMB.<br>
