A CSU-Monterey Bay professor who spent the summer in Mexico City
has produced a 30-minute documentary film about the chaotic
political situation in Mexico. Caitlin Manning, a professor of film
and video, was in Mexico when the populace took to the streets
after the ruling party&apos;s candidate, Felipe Calderon, squeaked to a
victory with the slimmest of margins.<br>
