<h4>Another building to come down</h4>
<p>Building 207, the unused three-story structure between Building
1 and dorm 208, will come down during the winter break.<br>
<br>
First, the building will be &quot;cleaned&quot; of any contamination.When the
building is certified clean, it will be demolished and hauled away.
The demolition contractor is Randazzo Enterprises of Castroville;
the abatement contractor is PARC Environmental of Fresno.</br></br></p>
<p>Building 207 has been assessed for contamination three times
since Fort Ord closed. All three surveys flagged minor
contamination that is typical of the materials and methods used in
military construction. The contaminated material will be removed by
the abatement contractor and disposed of properly.</p>
<p>The technicians working on the project are licensed and trained
by the EPA and OSHA and an engineering firm has been hired to
monitor and record air quality in the construction site and observe
the work practices of the abatement contractor.</p>
<p><strong>What You Need to Know</strong><br>
In preparation for the deconstruction, a chain-link fence will be
installed around the area on Friday, Dec. 8. The parking lot to
Bldg. 1 will be closed Thursday night in order to install the fence
early Friday. Once the fence is in place, most of the parking
spaces in that lot will be unavailable. The handicapped spaces will
remain open, and a few for visitors will be available. Employees
are asked to park across the street in the lots around Bldg. 21.
The contractor will start work next week. The work is scheduled to
be completed no later than Feb. 2.</br></p>
<p>The aerial photo (left) shows the chain link perimeter in
orange. The area shown in orange hatch will also need to be fenced
off when the building is being taken down, which is scheduled for
early January.</p>
<p>The construction fence is there for your protection. No one is
allowed within the construction site. If you need access to the
construction site, you must contact campus Planning and Development
and a visit will be arranged. Hard hats and protective footwear
will be necessary within the construction site.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong><br>
The contractor will begin to mobilize on Dec. 11, and abatement
will begin Dec. 13 and continue until Jan. 5. The deconstruction
will begin on Jan. 8, and is scheduled to be completed no later
than Feb. 2.<br/></br></p>
