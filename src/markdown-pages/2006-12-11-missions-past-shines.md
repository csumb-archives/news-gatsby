At 6:29 p.m. one August evening, San Antonio&apos;s Mission Concepci&#xF3;n
yielded a centuries-old secret. Receiving the revelation was a
volunteer at the mission, George Dawson. He watched as a sunbeam
shone just in front of the altar on the transept, the center of the
church&apos;s cross-shaped floor plan. &quot;Just because priests came into
the challenging environment of the Southwest and didn&apos;t live in the
midst of civilization doesn&apos;t mean they didn&apos;t know about science,
geometry, engineering and architecture,&quot; said Ruben Mendoza, a
professor who researched this phenomenon across the Southwest for
seven years. &quot;The brilliance comes through in the illuminations
themselves.&quot;<br>
