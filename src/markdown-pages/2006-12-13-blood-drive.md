<p>Campus supports blood drive<br>
<br>
Thirty students, staff and faculty turned out to donate blood last
week, despite the crush of end-of-semester work.</br></br></p>
<p>A mobile donor unit from Community Hospital of the Monterey
Peninsula spent three hours on campus as part of its holiday blood
drive. Between Thanksgiving and New Year&apos;s Day, the hospital&apos;s goal
is to collect 600 units.</p>
<p>&quot;The hospital has been coming here for a number of years, and
it&apos;s always been successful,&quot; said Flo Miller, campus health
service administrator.</p>
<p>The hospital collected 24 units of blood in the three hours it

<p>&quot;We were pleased that the turnout was so good. It hasn&apos;t been
that high in the p ast,&quot; said Nancy Shammas, donor recruiter for
Community Hospital.</p>
<p>Officials at the hospital remind us that blood donation is an
important way for healthy people to help their community. Blood
cannot be manufactured; the only way to keep up with the demand is
through regular blood donations from healthy volunteer donors.</p>
<p>Colleen Jozaitis, a student who was waiting in line with a
friend, said she was there because &quot;giving blood is a really cool
thing to do.&quot; Other members of the campus community apparently
agree.</p>
<p>Anyone who missed the opportunity last week can visit the
hospital&apos;s Monterey facility, at 576 Hartnell St., to give blood.
