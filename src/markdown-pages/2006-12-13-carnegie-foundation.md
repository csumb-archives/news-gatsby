<h4>CSUMB honored for community involvement</h4>
<p>CSUMB has been selected among the first group of schools to
receive the new Community Engagement Classification from the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.</p>
<p>&quot;Finding new and better ways to connect with their communities
should be a high priority for higher education institutions today,&quot;
said Lee S. Shulman, president of the Carnegie Foundation in a news
release.</p>
<p>&quot;The campuses participating in this elective classification
provide useful models of engagement around teaching and learning
and around research agendas that benefit from collaborative
relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>CSUMB was among 76 U.S. institutions to be chosen for their
involvement in the community through partnerships, community
service and other activities, as well as for making community
engagement an integral part of campus culture.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased that the Carnegie Foundation has recognized that
CSUMB&apos;s commitment to community engagement is one of our core
values and an important part of our mission,&quot; said CSUMB President
Dianne Harrison.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Foundation is an independent higher education
policy and research center. Since 1970, its classification of
colleges and universities has been used by organizations such as
U.S. News &amp; World Report to differentiate higher education
institutions.</p>
<p>The Community Engagement Classification is the first &quot;elective&quot;
classification offered by the Carnegie Foundation. Colleges and
universities were invited to apply and provide evidence of
community engagement. Campuses could apply under categories of
curricular engagement, outreach and partnerships, or both. CSUMB
applied for, and received, classification in the category of
curricular engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is further indication that the work that has gone into
building our Service Learning program is significant and at the
cutting edge of this work in higher education,&quot; said Seth Pollack,
CSUMB&apos;s director of service learning.</p>
<p>Added David Anderson, dean of the College of University Studies
and Programs, &quot;It is yet another external verification that CSUMB
is a center of excellence in higher education in the field of
community engagement.&quot;</p>
<p>Other California schools receiving the Community Engagement
Classification were CSU campuses in Chico, Fresno, San Francisco
and San Marcos, Pitzer College, Otis College of Art and Design,
Santa Clara University, UCLA, University of Redlands, University of
San Diego and University of San Francisco.</p>
