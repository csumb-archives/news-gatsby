<h4>Life-changing experience leads to generous gift</h4>
<p>Erik Edmonds (&apos;06, ESSP) is giving back to CSUMB in a big way.
His recent donation of $5,000 to the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy was the largest gift the university has
received from an alumnus to date.<br>
&quot;They caught me on a good day,&quot; Edmonds said with a laugh. Then,
taking a more serious tone, the law school student at the
University of Florida added, &quot;I always planned on giving back, and
will continue to do so annually for the rest of my life.&quot;<br>
Edmonds, who began college in Vermont, moved to Santa Cruz after
being paralyzed in a car accident. Before long, he &quot;started to get
bored&quot; and began looking at going back to school. Impressed by how
helpful people at CSUMB were, he enrolled as an Earth Systems
Science and Policy student in 2003.<br>
&quot;I found the entire program to be fascinating - environmental
ethics, justice, water law, resource assessment, coastal zone
management. I was fascinated with learning science and policy in
one big blanket, experiencing both sides of it.&quot;<br>
He also found great friends and mentors in the staff and
faculty.<br>
&quot;Judith Kildow is the best academic role model a person could ever
have. We started the same semester, and from day one she took me
under her wing. Celeste Akkad was also a good friend; she made me
feel at home while I was in school, made it seem easier to be
commuting from Santa Cruz.&quot;<br>
For his capstone, Edmonds assessed the feasibility of a proposed
ecological restoration project at Elkhorn Slough. &quot;I mapped out the
regulatory agencies and political bodies that would be part of the
approval process.&quot;<br>
He also spent two summers working as an intern with California
Assemblyman John Laird, where he answered phones and handled
constituents&apos; problems.<br>
That experience had a strong impact - Edmonds is now toying with
the idea of running for office in Florida when he finishes law
school. &quot;But, it&apos;s a big commitment, and I want to put some time
into the community first.&quot;<br>
For now, he enjoys the varied political opinions of people in the
Sunshine State. &quot;It&apos;s a 50-50 state, not as left-leaning as
California. A lot of intense discussions start outside of my
classes, and I&apos;m finding that I am defending myself constantly.
It&apos;s fun.&quot;<br>
If the Florida Legislature doesn&apos;t work out, Edmonds is also open
to the possibility of returning to CSUMB. &quot;The University of
Florida has a good environmental law program. I could teach an SEP
class in environmental law.&quot;<br>
Undoubtedly, the Division of Science and Environmental Policy would
welcome him back.<br>
&quot;Of all the students I have had in my long career as a professor,
Erik will stand out as the most memorable for his accomplishments,
his generosity of spirit, and his commitment to life and to
society,&quot; said Dr. Kildow. &quot;While his donation to the university is
a first for CSUMB, it does not surprise me. It is consistent with
his strong character and his humility.&quot;<br>
Edmonds puts it simply: &quot;The best thing to do was to give back to
the school. That place changed my life.&quot;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
