You may already be familiar with Fog Box record label from its
founder&apos;s two compilation CD releases, &quot;Unexploded Ordinance&quot; and
&quot;Out of Order,&quot; featuring local acts from the California State
University, Monterey Bay campus, and beyond. This week marks
another first for the label when hip-hop artist A.Lee celebrates
the release of her debut CVD, &quot;The Channel.&quot; &quot;This is our first
full-length CD by a single artist,&quot; said Fog Box founder and CSUMB
student Sara Bailey.<br>
