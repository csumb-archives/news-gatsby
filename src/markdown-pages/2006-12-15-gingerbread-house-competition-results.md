<h4>Tasteful houses sweeten party</h4>
<p>As Hansel and Gretel can attest, gingerbread houses, with their
candy-cane columns, gumdrop landscaping, peppermint pinwheel
decorations and icing trim, are practically irresistible.</p>
<p>So it&apos;s no surprise that these confectionary cottages - and
other structures - are the basis of a campus-wide competition now
in its third year.</p>
<p>The gingerbread house-building venture came out of a discussion
among members of the holiday party planning committee several years
ago. They hit upon the idea of having the campus community build
the houses and then using them for centerpieces at the annual
party. This year, seven teams - including several dozen employees -
participated in the competition. Each group was given a kit
consisting of the basic pieces and encouraged to let their
imaginations run wild. Dennis Hungridge of Human Resources
coordinated the event.</p>
<p>As for rules - there were only two: everything had to be edible,
and the overall &quot;footprint&quot; of the house could not exceed 14 inches
by 20 inches.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s theme, &quot;Extreme Makeover - Campus Edition,&quot;
reflected the building and demolition going on around campus.</p>
<p>Among the entries in the competition:</p>
<p>A team representing the president&apos;s office performed makeover
magic on the Aquatic Center, turning it into an &quot;Otter Haven,&quot;
complete with &quot;kelp&quot; made from lettuce, goldfish crackers and
chocolate otters.</p>
<p>The University Advancement team used &quot;Hot Tamales&quot; - bright red
candies shaped like tiny logs - to represent bricks on their remake
of the Meeting House.</p>
<p>Staff members from the Black Box Cabaret and Conferences and
Events Services joined forces to recreate the building site for the
Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library - including a
construction crane, contractor&apos;s trailer, tiny workers sporting
hard hats (and a port-a-potty for their use), rebar made from
spaghetti and covered with frosting, and replicas of the signs
(&quot;Future Home of . . .&quot; and &quot;Danger&quot;) hanging on the fence
surrounding the property. Even the &quot;dirt&quot; looked real - made from a
ground-up mixture of Oreo cookies, cream of wheat and crackers.</p>
<p>The team from Facilities Services and Operations recreated their
building and the new IT structure. Each team member worked on his
job-related portion of the structures - the electricians (using
blow torches!) made the light fixtures, the painter &quot;painted&quot; the
window sills with frosting, etc. &quot;It&apos;s all within union rules,&quot;
said Tony Cabeca.</p>
<p>Gingerbread cookies originated in Germany. The Germanic National
Museum in Nuremberg houses the oldest existing gingerbread recipe,
believed to have been written in 1395.</p>
<p>Gingerbread was baked long before the Middle Ages, but during
the 11th century, when ginger was introduced to Europeans, it took
off in popularity. And now, it&apos;s a &quot;building&quot; material.</p>
