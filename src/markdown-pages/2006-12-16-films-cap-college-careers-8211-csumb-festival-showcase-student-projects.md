A high school girl yearnedto attend college and to shape her
future. &quot;No,&quot; her mother said. &quot;If you go away to college, you&apos;ll
never come back to the family.&quot; This idea of a generational clash
sparked the beginning of Juan Figueroa&apos;s film &quot;Lettuce Roots.&quot; The
upshot is a 5.5-minute film, one of 14 by CSUMB students to be
shown at the Capstone Festival on Wednesday.<br>
