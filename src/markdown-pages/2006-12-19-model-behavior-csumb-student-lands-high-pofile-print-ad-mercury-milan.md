As far as quick-cash side gigs go, male modeling is probably among
the least likely arrangements for a struggling college student.
CSU-Monterey Bay student Tyler Birkestrand wasn&apos;t content to apply
at the local coffeehouse or record store for a job for some extra
spending money. Instead, he combed the Yellow Pages and Internet
looking for modeling agencies &quot;just kind of to see what was out
there.&quot;<br>
