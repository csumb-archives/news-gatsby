It sounds like a daunting task: to tackle global warming as &quot;the
issue of this generation.&quot; CSUMB, along with college students all
over the country, say they&apos;re up to it. On Jan. 31, CSUMB and some
1,450 schools, churches and civic groups will hold a teach-in on
global warming, called Focus The Nation, intended to encourage
policy makers to invest in clean energy. Locally, CSUMB anticipates
300 students throughout the day for its 10-speaker program. Salinas
Mayor Dennis Donohue and Santa Cruz County Treasurer Fred Keeley, a
former Central Coast assemblyman, will both give talks.<br>
