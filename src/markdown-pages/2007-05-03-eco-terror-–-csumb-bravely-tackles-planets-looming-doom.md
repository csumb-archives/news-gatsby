In a series of books that have made scientific and spiritual waves,
British environmental scientist James Lovelock warned that until
humans start thinking about the Earth as a system dependent on the
health of its parts - until biologists sit down with sociologists,
economists, fishermen . . . to generate integrated solutions to
drastic environmental problems - we&apos;re screwed. Lovelock&apos;s talk at
CSUMB last fall led campus organizers to host a symposium on April
30, bleakly titled &quot;Earth&apos;s Environmental Crisis and the Fate of
Humanity.&quot;<br>
