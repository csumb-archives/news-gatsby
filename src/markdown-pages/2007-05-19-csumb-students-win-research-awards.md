Two students from California State University, Monterey Bay won
awards for their original research at the CSU&apos;s annual student
research competition at the Dominguez Hills campus in Carson. The
system-wide contest showcases the high caliber of research
conducted by CSU students at all 23 campuses. Both local winners
competed in the Interdisciplinary category. Top honors went to
Andrew Coile, who earned a Master of Science degree in Management
and Information Technology. His research topic was &quot;Effectiveness
