Local poet Ric Masten summoned graduating CSU-Monterey Bay students
Saturday to leve school ready to tackle their wildest dreams. &quot;I
wish that everyone of you leaves the halls of academia with their
dreams intact, convinced that anything is possible,&quot; Masten told a
near-overflow crowd of about 8,000 students, faculty, family and
friends at Freeman Stadium.<br>
