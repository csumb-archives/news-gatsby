<p><strong>Txt Msgs Alert U</strong><br>
<strong><em>Cell phones transmit safety alerts at
CSUMB<br/></em></strong> Cell phones -- a convenient way to send
greetings to friends and family via text messages - have been
transformed into campus communications vehicles. At CSUMB, the
service is called -- what else? - OTTERalert. They blast out
campus-wide security and emergency communication alarms - a service
that has been getting a lot of attention since the tragic shootings
at Virginia Tech. The campus community can rest assured that
OTTERalert is for emergency alerts only; those who sign up will not
receive spam. Privacy is protected, and only campus administrators
and members of the University Police Department can originate the
messages. To read more, <a href="index.html" rel="nofollow">click

Bright Idea CSUMB to give away energy-efficient light bulbs
Oct.&#xA0;25&#xA0;</img></strong>&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>
CSUMB and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric think you can change the world
by changing a light bulb. And the public is invited to participate.
The university and the company have partnered to join the Energy
Star Change a Light, Change the World Campaign, a movement to
encourage people to help make a difference one energy-saving step
at a time. From noon to 6 p.m.on Oct. 25, students will join a
representative from PG&amp;E to distribute 1,000 compact
fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) to the public. The student
Environmental Committee, led by Associated Students Environmental
Senator Mary Berube, is organizing the event. To read more, click

displays student art</img></strong><br>
Work by students in VPA 347&#xA0;- Chicana/o Black Art, taught by
Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains and Professor Stephanie A. Johnson, is on
display in the CSUMB library. Based on the Spanish Castas paintings
of the 17th and 18th centuries which categorized the mestizaje or
&quot;mixed race&quot; people into socially stratified positions, the
students&apos; &quot;remix&quot; focuses on narratives of familial legacy,
ancestral exploration and personal cross-cultural negotiation.
Using the original paintings as a background with strategic
alteration and addition of elements, these modern pieces counter
the divisions, legal inequities, and fears promoted by the
historical Castas paintings. The students developed their own
narratives and reflections of hope in the new Castas images. The
work will be on display through Nov. 26.</br></p>

<p><strong>Eye of an artist, heart of an activist</strong><br>
The Visiting Artist Series presents the internationally acclaimed
artist Carrie Mae Weems in an evening of art, culture and politics
on Oct. 24. Her presentation gets under way at 7 p.m. in the World
Theater. Ms. Weems (pictured at left) is one of the most important
artists working today. Her work in photography, video and
installation examines the history of culture, gender and race
within American society. She uses narrative elements in her
photography to examine class and gender issues through the window
of personal experience and African-American heritage. &quot;Her work is
foundational in the construction of identities; they&apos;re pivotal
pieces in African-American life in the United States,&quot; &#xA0;says
Dr. Amalie Mesa-Bains. My responsibility as an artist is to work,
to sing for my supper, to make art, beautiful and powerful, that
adds and reveals; to beautify the mess of a messy world, to heal
the sick and feed the helpless; to shout bravely from the rooftops
and storm barricaded doors and voice the specificity of our
historical moment.. - Carrie Mae Weems</br></p>

<br>
A reminder: Fourth Avenue (the street behind the Alumni and
Visitors Center) between Divarty Street and Inter-Garrison Road is
ONE WAY southbound. There are no plans to make the street two-way,
even during the construction work in the area. It&apos;s a safety issue
&#x2013; the street is too narrow to safely accommodate two-way traffic
and parking.<br>
<br>
Third Avenue is closed to through traffic from Inter-Garrison Road
to Divarty Street while five wooden structures along Third are
coming down. Access to the Outdoor Recreation Center, the Child
Development Center and parking lot 84 will be available only from
Inter-Garrison. The work is expected to be completed in late
October.<br>
<br>
Fifth Avenue is closed to traffic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Divarty Street between Fourth Avenue and Gen. Jim Moore
Boulevard is open to westbound traffic only. Divarty remains closed
from Fourth east to the site of the new library. Traffic traveling
north on Engineer Lane will be able to access the Human Resources
Building, and Parking Lots 21 and 23. Traffic can access the lots
by turning off Gen. Jim Moore onto the small road just south of
Divarty Street, adjacent to the Veterans Clinic. This road connects
to Engineer Lane and to the entrance to Parking Lot 23. Parking Lot
21 will be accessed via a newly constructed entrance at the
southwest corner of Parking Lot 23.<br>

<strong>Moss</strong> <strong>Landing scientist surfaces with kelp
forest discovery -- Students from CSUMB among research
team</strong><br>
Deep in the tropics, a Moss Landing scientist endured a seemingly
endless string of mishaps - including broken equipment, a lost
anchor and a cut-off water supply&#xA0;- but discovered a marine
biologist&apos;s dream: a vast underwater forest, filled with creatures
such as self-camouflaging snails and sea-faring iguanas. The
forest, made of a kelp species thought to be headed for extinction,
is at least twice as deep as California&apos;s kelp forests, said
expedition co-leader Michael Graham, a marine biologist who works
at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. . . . Max Overstrom-Coleman, a
CSUMB student who compared the trip to the disastrous Apollo 13
mission, was the first diver to see the kelp. &quot;All the frustrations
of the previous few days, the expensive equipment that&apos;s lost, the
headache and the heartbreak immediately goes away as you realize
you hit the jackpot,&quot; he said.<br>

<p><strong>Migrating to College</strong> -- <strong>farmworkers&apos;
kids trod new paths</strong><br>
Yesenia Velasquez blends into the high school crowd with her
low-key style and soft-spoken voice - her quiet manner and perfect
posture accentuated by her dangling silver and blue earrings and
curly brown hair tied neatly in a ponytail. . . . Her story is
similar to 58 of her peers who attended a daylong workshop Friday
at CSU-Monterey Bay, designed to help high school seniors of
migrant parents learn about the online college application
process.<br>

<p><strong>Legal boundaries, ethical quandaries</strong>&#xA0;-
President&apos;s Speakers Series continues at CSUMB An award-winning
documentary filmmaker and a high-profile political activist will
visit the World Theater at California State University, Monterey
Bay, as the President&apos;s Speakers Series continues. Inaugurated last
spring, the series is intended to enhance the intellectual life of
the campus and the community. This semester&apos;s series title is
&quot;Exploring People, Ethics and the Law.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Men&apos;s soccer on playoff bubble Now or
never.<br/></strong> To many, that may not seem like an enviable
situation to be in. CSU-Monterey Bay men&apos;s soccer coach Artie
Cairel wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. With four games to go, the
Otters find themselves three measly points out o a guaranteed spot
in the NCAA playoffs.&#xA0;<br>

<p><strong>Documentary on Mexican musician is a rich character
study</strong><br>
It was supposed to be a short film about a Mexican musician trying
to get by in San Francisco&apos;s Mission District. Instead, once
director Mark Becker got into the life of his subject, Carmelo
Muniz Sanchez, 63, he discovered a rich character study and story
of the human effect of illegal immigration in reverse. The result
was &quot;Romantico,&quot; Becker&apos;s debut feature, which screens Tuesday
night at the World Theater at CSU-Monterey Bay.<br>

<p><strong>Evidence Dance Co. premieres new work, brings back old
friend</strong><br>
Pittsburgh Courier photographer Charles &quot;Teenie&quot; Harris was just
covering a beat. Sports, politics, funerals, a trip to the beauty
parlor. Eleanor Roosevelt and Lena Horne and the guy down at the
local bar and grill. In the end, what he captured was everyday life
in Pittsburgh &#x2013; most particularly of the African American community
there &#x2013; for almost 40 years. Choreographer Ronald K. Brown&apos;s new
dance composition &quot;One Shot,&quot; coming to the World Theater at
CSU-Monterey Bay tonight, is interested in honoring Harris and in
the idea of legacy - not only the one someone creates, but the
influence of one inherited.<br>

<p><strong>Chinatown plan pleads its case - city wants to hear more
specifics about the project</strong><br>
A bright future is taking shape for one of Salinas&apos; most blighted
neighborhoods, according to plans presented at a city meeting
attended by more than 60 people Tuesday evening. . . The Chinatown
Renewal Project is a multi-year community planning effort led by
California State University, Monterey Bay to clean up and
revitalize about eight blocks north of downtown.<br>

<p><strong>Towersey has postseason plans for Otters<br/></strong>
In her first year on the job, CSU-Monterey Bay women&apos;s golf coach
Marianne Towersey kept it simple. All she wanted was time to
evaluate the team&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, and design a plan to
build up the program. Year 2 has much loftier goals. &quot;We&apos;re finally
eligible for the postseason,&quot; said Towersey. &quot;That&apos;s what we&apos;re
going after.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Author&apos;s Table gaining recognition</strong><br>
Monterey County bibliophiles will get a chance to sit down and dine
on some delectable food and conversation at this year&apos;s Author&apos;s
Table. The sixth annual event, scheduled for Nov. 4 and 5, brings
16 authors to Monterey County, sponsored by the National Steinbeck
Center and CSU-Monterey Bay. The event will raise money for each
organization&apos;s reading and writing programs.&#xA0;<br>

<p><strong>Soccer teams at critical juncture</strong><br>
Critical points. That&apos;s where both the CSU-Monterey Bay men&apos;s and
women&apos;s soccer teams find themselves after passing the midpoint of
their schedules. For the men, it&apos;s been a roller coaster ride so
far, with many more valleys than peaks. The women&apos;s team is coming
off a victory, and should benefit from playing its next three games
at home.<br>

<p><strong>Otters&apos; unsung hero</strong><br>
When Jody Garry took over as head coach of the CSU-Monterey Bay
volleyball team late last spring, she had some understanding of
what she was getting into and the type of players she was
inheriting. She knew, for example, that seven seniors were
returning&#xA0;- &#xA0;four of them starters . . .&#xA0;<br>

<p><strong>CSU Monterey Bay Announces $4 Million
Donation</strong><br>
