U.S. Department of Education has awarded CSUMB nearly $1 million in
grant money to help students from underrepresented backgrounds
prepare for doctoral studies, President Dianne F. Harrison has
announced.</img></p>
<p>Funded through the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate
Achievement Program, the grant will support 25 students each year
for four years as they pursue research and other scholarly
activities.</p>
<p>The goal of the program, named for the African-American
astronaut and scientist who died in the Challenger disaster in
1984, is to increase the number of underrepresented, low income and
first-generation college students who earn doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>&quot;Receiving the McNair program award demonstrates that CSUMB has
a proven track record of preparing underrepresented students for
study at the doctoral level, and that we have the potential to do
even more to achieve that goal,&quot; said Dr. Harrison. &quot;This will be a
wonderful opportunity for students interested in graduate study and
research.&quot;</p>
<p>McNair Scholars will work with a faculty mentor on a research
project, engage in a summer research internship, receive academic
support services, and visit doctoral institutions. The students
will also benefit from guest lecturers, workshops and a research
methods seminar.</p>
<p>&#xA0;The CSUMB McNair grant was written by Dr. William Head of
the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and Dr. Renee R.
Curry, dean of the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
It will serve students in the sciences, humanities, and social
sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;McNair Scholars will have unparalleled opportunities to work
with some of the highest qualified research faculty in the state
and to present their research at professional conferences and in
peer reviewed journals.~ These rich experiences create the currency
students need to get accepted into top tier Ph.D. graduate
programs,&quot; said Dr. Head.</p>
<p>The first group of McNair Scholars will be recruited this
academic year. They must have a minimum grade-point average of 3.0,
and sophomore, junior or senior standing. Participants will be
selected based on academic potential and interest in pursing a
doctoral degree.</p>
<p>&quot;McNair Scholars come to understand the world of academia and to
imagine themselves as active participants in it. They embrace
themselves as intellectuals, cherish their intellectual curiosity,
and establish a sense of scholarly discipline necessary to carry
them through to the Ph.D,&quot; said Dr. Curry.</p>
