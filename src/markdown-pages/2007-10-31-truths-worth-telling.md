Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg visits campus Nov. 28</img></h4>
<p>The President&apos;s Speakers Series concludes this semester&apos;s
presentations with a Nov. 28 visit by Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, the RAND
Corp. analyst who, in 1971, leaked the classified Pentagon Papers
to the New York Times.</p>
<p>The documents revealed the U.S. government had engaged in a
pattern of deceiving the public about the number of Vietnam War
casualties and the nation&apos;s ability to win the war. And they
instantly validated the antiwar protest movement.</p>
<p>He&apos;ll be talking about his book, &quot;Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam
and the Pentagon Papers,&quot; copies of which will be available for
sale.</p>
<p>The papers&#xA0;- over 7,000 pages&#xA0;- revealed that every
administration from Harry Truman&apos;s had falsely painted what was a
civil war in Vietnam as a cold-war struggle between the free
nations of the world and those under communist rule.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellsberg was arrested and put on trial for leaking the
documents, but the judge dismissed the charges against him due to
improper governmental conduct that included evidence tampering and
illegal wiretapping.</p>
<p>Since then, he has been a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons
proliferation, an international advocate for peace and an early
opponent of the Iraq War.</p>
<p>A question-and-answer session will follow the talk.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellsberg&apos;s lecture will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater
on Sixth Avenue. It&apos;s free and open to the public; no tickets are
necessary but reservations are encouraged and can be made online at
csumb.edu/speakers. To request disability accommodations, call

<p>&#xA0;The President&apos;s Speakers Series, which was inaugurated
during the spring 2007 semester, is intended to enhance the
intellectual life of the campus and the community.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&quot;Not long after she arrived on campus, President Harrison
asked the faculty what she could do for them. They asked for a
speakers series that would stimulate thought and discussion,&quot; said
Renee Curry, dean of the College of Arts, Humanities and Social
Sciences. The speakers series is also a way to invite the community
onto campus.</p>
<p>Suggestions for speakers came from the faculty. &quot;We were looking
for a variety of appeal, for people who had interdisciplinary
ideas, and who could speak to a variety of audiences,&quot; said Dean
Curry.</p>
<p>It came down to matching each speaker&apos;s availability with the
campus schedule. Three names emerged: Dr. Philip Zimbardo,
professor emeritus of psychology at Stanford University, who
visited campus on Sept. 25; Mark Becker, a documentary filmmaker
who showed his film Rom&#xE1;ntico on Oct. 23; and Dr. Ellsberg.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&quot;The President selects the series title. &apos;Exploring
People, Ethics and the Law&apos; was chosen because all three speakers
will address the intersection of ethics and law and how this
intersection affects the lives of real people,&quot; said Dean
Curry.</p>
<p>The series got off to a great start when Dr. Zimbardo drew a
standing-room-only crowd to the World Theater.</p>

of the world&apos;s leading psychologists, he is best known for
conducting the Stanford Prison Experiment. His 1971 experiment
&quot;showed how anonymity, conformity and boredom can be used to induce
sadistic behavior in otherwise wholesome students,&quot; said The New
York Times.</img></p>
<p>More recently, Dr. Zimbardo has investigated how policy
decisions and individual choices led to abuse at Abu Ghraib prison
in Iraq, a subject he examines in his new book, &quot;The Lucifer
Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil.&quot;</p>
<p>&#xA0;Mr. Becker&quot;s presentation was also well received.</p>
<p>The documentary, shown at the Sundance Film Festival, started
out as a 10-minute short but turned into a three-year journey to
document the life of Carmelo Muniz S&#xE1;nchez. The undocumented
mariachi was working in San Francisco to support h</p>
