<h4>Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg visits campus
Nov. 28</h4>
<p>The CSUMB President&apos;s Speakers Series concludes this semester&apos;s
presentations with a Nov. 28 visit by Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, the RAND
Corp. analyst who, in 1971, leaked the classified Pentagon Papers
to the New York Times.</p>
<p>The documents revealed the U.S. government had engaged in a
pattern of deceiving the public about the number of Vietnam War
casualties and the nation&apos;s ability to win the war. And they
instantly validated the antiwar protest movement.</p>
<p>He&apos;ll be talking about his book, &quot;Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam
and the Pentagon Papers,&quot; copies of which will be available for
sale.</p>
<p>The papers - over 7,000 pages - revealed that every
administration from Harry Truman&apos;s had falsely painted what was a
civil war in Vietnam as a cold-war struggle between the free
nations of the world and those under communist rule.<br>
<br>
Dr. Ellsberg was arrested and put on trial, but the judge dismissed
the charges against him due to improper governmental conduct that
included evidence tampering and illegal wiretapping.</br></br></p>
<p>Since then, he has been a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons
proliferation, an international advocate for peace and an early
opponent of the Iraq War.</p>
<p>A question-and-answer session and book-signing will follow the
talk.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellsberg&apos;s lecture will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater
on Sixth Avenue. It&apos;s free and open to the public; no tickets are
necessary but reservations are strongly encouraged and can be made
online at csumb.edu/speakers or by calling the World Theater box
office at 582-4580 between noon and 4 p.m. To request disability
accommodations, call 582-4189.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map can be found at
csumb.edu/map.</p>
<p>The President&apos;s Speakers Series will resume in February. Visit
