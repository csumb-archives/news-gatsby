Teacher, thespian, poet, environmentalist, lecturer, scholar - Dr.
Barbara Mossberg is a living example of integrated studies and the
potential for interdisciplinary. Or, as she describes it, living
purple.</img></br></p>
<p>&quot;Purple is the color of Integrated Studies,&quot; says Dr. Mossberg
(or &quot;Dr. B,&quot; as her students call her), who directs the IS program
at CSUMB. &quot;Just as red and blue make purple, purple represents the
creativity which is forged through the fusion of arts and sciences
and the disciplines that make up our students&apos; academic dream
plans.&quot;</p>
<p>One example of Dr. B&apos;s purple lifestyle is her scholarship on
the life of Sierra Club founder John Muir. In numerous articles,
public presentations, and an upcoming book, she examines how Muir,
a geologist, used language arts to influence environmental public
policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a particular interest in how humanities and arts express
and shape values and ideas about our environment which become
public policy and legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking fusion one step further, she is tying this research in to
a theatrical production: &quot;I&apos;m writing a musical which interweaves
how the ways artists and writers have portrayed trees intersect
with politics and public policy.&quot; Though at first that may seem
like a stretch, Dr. B puts in simply: &quot;Drama is a way to bring all
the different disciplines together.&quot;</p>
<p>Drama has been a lifelong interest for her. As a young girl, she
wrote and performed plays in her neighborhood. &quot;I invited the
neighbors to my little shoebox theater and then the front yard
Little Theater and sold lemonade and cookies.&quot;</p>
<p>For the past 30 years, she has been performing a series of her
own one-woman plays based on Emily Dickinson, the subject of Dr.
B&apos;s award-winning book and much of her scholarship and
international lecturing.</p>
<p>Another recent theater credit includes a starring role as
Lettice in the Carl Cherry Center for the Arts production of
Lettice and Lovage.</p>
<p>&quot;This play is a tribute to education and to educators. Lettice
takes it upon herself to educate everyone . . . she is a helpless
educator. She cannot help using every moment as an opportunity to
excite passion for what there is to know. She makes each moment a
teaching moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps Lettice isn&apos;t so far from Dr. B herself. She began her
academic career teaching drama and literature at the University of
Oregon. Later, her teaching career expanded to include an
international appointment as senior Fulbright distinguished
lecturer at the University of Helsinki where she continued teaching
American literature and drama as bicentennial chair of American
studies.</p>
<p>Over the course of her career, she&apos;s won teaching awards from
every university she&apos;s been associated with (including several more
Fulbright&apos;s) and served as president of Goddard College, a title
she retains as Emeriti.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department recognized her educational leadership
and appointed her U.S. Scholar in Residence to represent American
higher education in the U.S. and around the world. She&apos;s lectured
and consulted for countless educational, governmental, and
nonprofit organizations, proving that she&apos;s willing to take on
almost any subject in any setting and make it a teachable moment.
After all, it just deepens her purple hue.</p>
<p>Dr. Mossberg&apos;s leadership role promoting ideas about an
integrated education &quot;for the whole person, the whole life, the
whole world&quot; led to her serving as senior fellow for the American
Council on Education for college and university leaders, including
for the Center for Institutional and International Initiatives, and
the Office of Women.</p>
<p>Her educational vision of &quot;treating with reverence each other
and the earth&quot; drew her immediately to CSUMB&apos;s Vision, and once on
campus, she was drawn &quot;like a moth to a flame&quot; to the Integrated
Studies program. Based on her educational philosophy and values,
she seeks to empower students and faculty to embrace their various
interests and curiosities and synthesize those ideas into
meaningful educational plans.</p>
<p>&quot;The students burst into my office with an ambitious agenda
fueled by their own conscience and idealism and practical goals for
how to make a difference in their world. I ask them, what
experiences, abilities, skills, and knowledge do you need to play
this role? We consider our whole CSUMB curriculum, faculty, and
programs as the canvas on which to draw. We are a team that fosters
the ability to be purple, so that they can be the full, whole,
complex, coherent learners they are and that our society so
needs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Integrated Studies program,&quot; she says, &quot;is the &apos;don&apos;t
settle zone&apos;. If a student is interested in art, digital design,
marine mammal education, Japanese, and scuba, and wants to work on
international aquarium-based public environmental education, this
major says, &apos;you are not Cinderella&apos;s ugly stepsisters, trying to
cut off your toes and heels from a perfectly splendid foot to fit a
little glass slipper of some prince single major.&apos; We have a
program which accommodates your complexity.&quot; She adds, &quot;For me,
part of the pleasure is working with our interdisciplinary faculty,
who make my purple mind feel so at home.&quot;</p>
<p>Her scholarly and lecture projects include works in progres on
integral education of &quot;ancient wisdom and emergent knowledge,&quot; the
role of classics in multicultural education, American cultural
studies, integral leadership, and her own poetry and photography.
She gives poetry readings, and lectures locally and nationally in
theaters and educational centers and Yosemite National Park (a
recent environmental-rousing talk was in a barn with horses looking
on!), including keynoting Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>Wanting to support both arts and environmental education, Dr.
Mossberg is on many local community boards, including serving as
president of the Forest Theater Guild, and is devoted to Restore
Hetch Hetchy.</p>
<p>&quot;My life is definitely purple. I tell my mother, who worries at
how busy I am, it&apos;s a beautiful life, because I love all the colors
that make it up, every part of what I am doing.&quot;</p>
