<h4>San Jose Taiko performs at World Theater Dec. 6</h4>
<p><img style="width:250px; height:300px" alt="San Jose Taiko" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/zzzzzzzzz%20san%20jose%20taiko%20dums.bmp">San
Jose Taiko will take the stage at California State University,
Monterey Bay&apos;s World Theater on Dec. 6 as the performing arts
series continues.<br>
<br>
The word &quot;taiko&quot; is Japanese for drum, and the art of drumming has
been a staple of Japanese culture for centuries.<br>
<br>
The group was formed in 1973 by Japanese-Americans who were looking
for a way to express themselves and explore their cultural
heritage. Since then, the group has mesmerized audiences with its
powerful and spellbinding music - music that expresses the beauty
and harmony of the human spirit through the voice of the
taiko.<br>
<br>
As a symbol, taiko holds much of the essence and spirit of Japan,
replete with continued possibilities, renewal and transformation.
Its origins were found in the daily life of the common people.
Priests used taiko to dispel evil spirits and insects from the rice
fields; Samurai used taiko to instill fear in the enemy and courage
in themselves; and the peasants used taiko in their prayers for
rain, in festivals, and in thanksgiving for bountiful harvests. The
traditional practice and performance of taiko requires dedication,
physical endurance, harmony and a collective spirit.<br>
<br>
San Jose Taiko has taken this essence and voice of the traditional
taiko and infused it with the vitality and freshness of their
American spirit, creating a new art form. The artists use the power
and beauty of taiko to transcend cultural barriers and foster a
greater understanding of the Japanese-American culture. Taiko is so
deeply a part of the traditions of the Japanese and the Shinto and
Buddhist religions that it is considered to be both the essence and
the heartbeat of the Japanese spirit.<br>
<br>
By studying with masters of other traditions and cultures, San Jose
Taiko musicians have broadened and embellished this historical art
form. Their style joins the traditional rhythms of Japanese
drumming with the beat of world rhythms, including African,
Balinese, Brazilian, Latin and jazz percussion. The sound is
contemporary, exciting, new and innovative, bridging many styles
while still resonant of the Asian soul in America.<br>
<br>
