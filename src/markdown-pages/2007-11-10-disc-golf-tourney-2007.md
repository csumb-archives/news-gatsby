<p>The putting greens are a little bumpy, the &quot;holes&quot; stand five
feet above ground and the fairways are far from manicured. But the
greens fees are free and golf shoes aren&apos;t required. The disc golf
courses at California State University, Monterey Bay won&apos;t remind
anyone of Pebble Beach, but for disc golfers, the 36 holes of the
Oaks and Cypress courses are magical.</p>
<p>The university&apos;s Disc Golf Club invites the public to attend the
West Coast College Open on Saturday, Nov. 10, when the Otters take
on a team from UC-Santa Cruz. The first disc flies at 9 a.m. on the
Cypress Course. The afternoon round will be played on the Oaks
Course starting at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>This will be only the second time on the West Coast that two
universities have officially played each other in disc golf. CSUMB
has hosted professional tournaments for the last nine years, but
there has been only one other intercollegiate tournament.</p>
<p>The hope is eventually to have a regional league involving
UC-Santa Cruz, San Jose State, Santa Clara, San Francisco State and
CSUMB.</p>
<p>A schedule for Saturday&apos;s tournament, a map and parking
directions are available at clubs.csumb.edu/discgolf.<br/></p>
