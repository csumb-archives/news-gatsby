<h4>CSUMB students organize activities for campus, community</h4>
<p><br>
Students at California State University, Monterey Bay have
organized a week of events to commemorate National Hunger and
Homelessness Awareness Week, Nov. 13-19. The week&apos;s activities will
give students and community members an opportunity to get involved
as well as raise awareness around issues of hunger and
homelessness.</br></p>
<p>From 7 to 9 p.m. on Nov. 14, a panel will be held in the
University Center Living Room called &quot;Faces of Homelessness.&quot;
Members of the Soledad Street community and service providers will
talk about issues relating to hunger and poverty in our area. An
exhibit of photography depicting the people of Soledad Street will
be on display.<br>
<br>
A &quot;shantytown&quot; will be set up in the university&apos;s Main Quad on Nov.
15 to illustrate living conditions and statistics relevant to
homelessness, poverty and inadequate housing in Monterey County.
That night, students will perform vignettes based on interviews
with local homeless people. The vignettes will be followed by a
student-led discussion on hunger, homelessness and poverty and
strategies for addressing those issues.</br></br></p>
<p>Students have also organized a meal points collection drive.
Meal-point dollars donated by CSUMB students will provide
Thanksgiving dinners for 80 families in collaboration with the
Alisal Healthy Start Family Resource Center and Sodexho, the
university&apos;s food service provider. The Thanksgiving Meal Point
Drive is in its seventh year and offers CSUMB students the
opportunity to make a significant impact, contributing both time
and money to prepare and assemble the food boxes. On Nov. 19,
students, faculty and staff will sort the food, and pack and
deliver the boxes.</p>
