Inter-Garrison Road, one of the main east-west streets on the
California State University, Monterey Bay campus, will be closed to
through traffic starting Wednesday, Nov. 14.</br></p>
<p>The road will be closed while hot water lines are installed
underground; when the project is completed, the lines will
distribute heat to campus buildings and result in significant
energy savings.</p>
<p>Detours will be available. Drivers are asked to follow the
signs.</p>
<p>Divarty Street, the other main east-west street on campus, has
been closed for several months. It will reopen on Tuesday, Nov.
13.<br/></p>
