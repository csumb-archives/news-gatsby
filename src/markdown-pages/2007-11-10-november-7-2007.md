<p><strong>$1 million gift received from Packard
Foundation</strong><br>
--President Dianne Harrison has recognized the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation for its gift of $1 million toward the cost of
the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library. &quot;This leadership
gift is a major vote of confidence in the university,&quot; said Dr.
Harrison. &quot;It represents the Foundation&apos;s deep commitment toward
student success, and it sends a strong message to our community
about the importance of private support for the library.&quot;<br>
When it is completed next September, the library will be the
academic and social heart of the campus, CSUMB&apos;s defining building
and a regional landmark.</br></br></p>

President&apos;s Speakers Series concludes this semester&apos;s presentations
with a Nov. 28 visit by Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, the RAND Corp. analyst
who, in 1971, leaked the classified Pentagon Papers to the New York
Times. The documents revealed the U.S. government had engaged in a
pattern of deceiving the public about the number of Vietnam War
casualties and the nation&apos;s ability to win the war. And they
instantly validated the antiwar protest movement. He&apos;ll be talking
about his book, &quot;Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon
Papers,&quot; copies of which will be available for sale. To reserve a

pieces by sculpture students, are on display in the
Balfour/Brutzman Gallery in VPA Bldg. 71. In &quot;Guardians,&quot; students
created self-portraits to express their thoughts about what they
might guard or protect. The pieces in &quot;Walking Through&quot; are made of

of shoes. Hours are Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

-&#xA0;<strong>Through Nov. 26</strong>: Works by students in VPA
347 Chicana/o Black Art taught by Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains and
Professor Stephanie A. Johnson is on display in the library. Based
on the Spanish Castas paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries
which categorized the mestizaje or &quot;mixed race&quot; people into
socially stratified positions, the students&apos; &quot;remix&quot; focuses upon
narratives of familial legacy, ancestral exploration, and personal
cross-cultural negotiation. Using the original paintings as a
background with strategic alteration and addition of elements,
these modern pieces counter the divisions, legal inequities, and
fears promoted by the historical Castas paintings. The students
developed their own narratives and reflections of hope in the new
Castas images.</br></br></p>

-&#xA0;A reminder: Fourth Avenue (the street behind the Alumni and
Visitors Center) between Divarty Street and Inter-Garrison Road is
ONE WAY southbound. There are no plans to make the street two-way,
even during the construction work in the area. It&apos;s a safety issue
- the street is too narrow to safely accommodate two-way traffic
and parking.</br></br></p>
<p>-&#xA0;Third Avenue is closed to through traffic from
Inter-Garrison Road to Divarty Street while five wooden structures
along Third are coming down. Access to the Outdoor Recreation
Center, the Child Development Center and parking lot 84 will be
available only from Inter-Garrison. The work is expected to be
completed in late October.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;Fifth Avenue is closed to traffic.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;Divarty Street between Fourth Avenue and Gen. Jim Moore
Boulevard is open to westbound traffic only. Divarty remains closed
from Fourth east to the site of the new library. Traffic traveling
north on Engineer Lane will be able to access the Human Resources
Building, and Parking Lots 21 and 23. Traffic can access the lots
by turning off Gen. Jim Moore onto the small road just south of
Divarty Street, adjacent to the Veterans Clinic. This road connects
to Engineer Lane and to the entrance to Parking Lot 23. Parking Lot
21 will be accessed via a newly constructed entrance at the
southwest corner of Parking Lot 23.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;Our campus is under construction. Please be cautious
around construction areas. We invite you to view this <a href="http://cdo.csumb.edu/site/x4929.xml%20" rel="nofollow">short

<strong>Otters ready for playoff run<br/></strong>If you think the
CSU-Monterey Bay men&apos;s soccer team&apos;s only goal was to make the
playoffs, think again. Courtesy of a dramatic come-from-behind 2-2
tie against CSU-Los Angeles last Sunday, the Otters qualified for
the California Collegiate Athletic Association&apos;s post-season
tournament, which begins today in Carson.<br>

<p><strong>Dance for Dead - Mexican holiday fetes
spirits</strong><br>
Surrounded by massive flower-adorned altars, to the beat of drums
and the scent of burning sage, hundreds of people carried candles
at CSU-Monterey Bay on a fog-drenched Thursday night to celebrate
the memory of loved ones passed away. Produced by the school&apos;s
Visual and Public Art Department, the event was part of the
contemporary revival of the traditional Mexican Days of the Dead,
in which deceased friends and family are remembered and honored on
Nov. 1 and 2.<br>

<p><strong>Voice of the people at Author&apos;s
Table<br/></strong>Through the devastation of the Southern
California fires, Los Angeles Times columnist Al Martinez found
himself doing what he does best - writing. . . Martinez will be one
of 16 authors participating in the sixth annual Author&apos;s Table,
co-sponsored by CSU-Monterey Bay and the National Steinbeck Center,
Sunday and Monday.<br>

<p><strong>Family key element for CSUMB
donors<br/></strong>Stephen Weldon, the director of Planned Giving
for California State University, Monterey Bay, said his approach is
a little different from that used by his peers at other academic
institutions. &quot;What we focus on is learning about the family
history, its values, ethics and the challenges they have overcome,&quot;
Weldon said.<br>

<p><strong>CSUMB gets $1M grant for doctoral
students<br/></strong>College students interested in pursuing
doctoral studies might get an extra boost as a result of a federal
grant received this week at CSU-Monterey Bay. Officials at the
college announced Tuesday it had received almost $1 million to help
minority students pursue Ph.D.s. The grant from the U.S. Department
of Education is part of the Robert E. McNair Postbaccalaureate
Achievement Program. &quot;The fact that we will be adding to the
preparation of students who will be McNair scholars means they have
a much better chance in getting into very prestigious Ph.D.
programs,&quot; said CSUMB president Dianne Harrison.<br>

<p><strong>Brecht tweak - CSU-Monterey Bay provides a modern
backbeat to &apos;The Good Woman (of Setzuan)&apos;<br/></strong>California
State University-Monterey Bay&apos;s production of Bertolt Brecht&apos;s &quot;The
Good Woman (of Setzuan)&quot; contains a somewhat unique set of
elements, which together seemingly provide the makings of an
engrossing night of drama, one in which you can lose yourself in
the action on stage.<br>
The tickets are free (cool). The &quot;theater&quot; is a converted army
chapel referred to as &quot;The Meeting House&quot; (quaint). The audience is
interspersed among the actors and action of the play, an intimate
65-70 seated per performance (cozy). The characters wear hand-made
masks crafted by professor, director and mask-maker Will Shepherd
(classy). But don&apos;t get too comfortable.<br>

<p><strong>Table Talk - The Author&apos;s Table revives the lost art of
the literary salon</strong><br>
. . . . Called the Author&apos;s Table, the event, now in its sixth
year, combines the nourishment of a dinner party with the literary
exchange of a salon. Literary salons - intimate and intellectual
gatherings at the homes of distinguished people - once flourished
throughout Europe. Most famous, perhaps, is that of Gertrude Stein
where she hosted Picasso, Hemingway, Fitzgerald and others. Closer
to home, Henry Miller hosted salons that attracted artists, writers
and celebrities from all corners. The Steinbeck Center and CSU
Monterey Bay collaborate on the Author&apos;s Table, which consists of a
200-person champagne reception/luncheon at CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s
University Center paneled by six of the Author&apos;s Table authors; a
VIP opening reception for all 15 authors at Pasadera Country Club;
and Monday evening dinners at the homes of notable local hosts,
each starting at 6pm, each attended by one author, all open to the
public.<br>

<p><strong>Talking about Anime</strong><br>
INK writer Leslie Escobar sits down with members of the CSUMB Anime
Club to find all the buzz in Japanese animation<br>
Alan Sprenkel has seen the effects of anime obsession up close.
Sprenkel, 22, dressed up as a favorite anime - short for Japanese
animation - character, Kakashi, a few years ago at a convention.
&quot;The first year I did a good one I had fan girls who liked this
character getting 20-foot-long running starts and tackling me to
the ground,&quot; said Sprenkel, who&apos;s a student at California State
University, Monterey Bay. &quot;Last year I got lucky because my
girlfriend came with us and every time she saw someone coming, she
literally got between us and went, &apos;No, it&apos;s mine,&apos; because she is
as big of a Kakashi girl as the girls who tackle me.&quot; Trevor Nagy,
a CSUMB student and friend of Sprenkel&apos;s, smiled as the story was
told as the two hung out at the Otter Bay Restaurant on campus.
Nagy and Sprenkel are both members of the CSUMB Anime Club, which
was formed about nine years ago. Throughout the years, both said
they&apos;ve noticed a surging interest in anime and manga, or Japanese
comics. Today, the club has about 50 members.<br>

<p><strong>Police pedal CSUMB area - eight of 14 officers patrol
Seaside campus on bicycles<br/></strong>If you&apos;ve been on the
California State University, Monterey Bay campus in the past couple
of months, you may have noticed a few new bicyclists zipping around
the Seaside campus. . . Police say patrolling on mountain bikes
allows them easier access to quad areas and walking trails and
makes them more approachable by students, faculty, staff and
visitors on campus. &quot;People seem to like it because you blend in
more with the public,&quot; said Officer David Ham, adding that he
enjoys biking so much he&apos;s been invited to join the campus bike
club on weekend rides.<br>
