<p>Steven Watkins, one of CSUMB&apos;s founding librarians, was awarded
the first ever lifetime membership by a marine science library
association for his contributions throughout the years.</p>
<p>The International Association of Aquatic and Marine Science
Libraries and Information Centers&apos; executive board created the
award specifically to honor Mr. Watkins and his many years of
service to the organization.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect senior librarians to influence the profession beyond
their institution. In addition to the contributions he makes every
day to CSUMB, our organization has benefited from Steve&apos;s
background in technology and his interest in the use of open source
software for library applications. He has clearly influenced the
profession of marine and aquatic science librarianship on a global
scale,&quot; said IAMSLIC&apos;s president Barbara Butler in presenting the
award at the group&apos;s annual conference in Saratoga, Fla.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins was instrumental in creating IAMSLIC&apos;s very
successful international resource-sharing program. This pioneering
project enables member libraries to locate and obtain scientific
publications from other libraries around the world to support
research being conducted at their institutions. As marine and
aquatic research has become increasingly global in scope, this
system enables students and researchers in CSUMB&apos;s Coastal and
Watershed Science &amp; Policy program, for instance, to gain
access to important studies being conducted on coastal environments
worldwide. During the past year alone, 110 IAMSLIC libraries in 44
countries obtained nearly 4,000 documents using this system. Five
libraries in the Monterey Bay region are active contributors to the
resource-sharing program, including CSUMB.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins also created an online membership database that
works in conjunction with the resource-sharing program and online
voting system. According to Butler, &quot;IAMSLIC has nearly 400 members
who come from both developed and developing nations worldwide. Some
of us work in small one-person libraries while others are from
large academic institutions. Steve&apos;s work on behalf of IAMSLIC
allows us all to share resources. The success of these open-source
solutions to our technology needs is evident - members of other
small organizations are attempting to emulate Steve&apos;s work.&quot;</p>
<p>While serving as IAMSLIC President in 2003-04, Watkins
successfully negotiated formal cooperative agreements between
IAMSLIC and the Fisheries Division of the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations and between IAMSLIC and the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. The lifetime
award also recognizes his leadership in establishing these
important inter-institutional relationships.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins is currently the coordinator of technology
development at CSUMB&apos;s library. He joined the faculty in 1995 and
is a past chair of the CSUMB Academic Senate. He is a frequent
presenter on technology-enabled library services and a longtime
contributor to collaborative library programs in the Monterey Bay
region. He holds a master of library science degree from the
University of California, Berkeley, and a bachelor of science
degree in biology from Stanford University.</p>
