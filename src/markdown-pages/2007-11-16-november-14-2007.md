<p><strong>Division of Student Affairs launches First-Year Call
Center<br/></strong>The Vice President&apos;s Office of Student Affairs
has implemented the First-Year Call Center. The Call Center
provides another way to reach out to first-year students and inform
them of campus information, advising and registration deadlines,
discuss their overall satisfaction, educate them about how to get
involved, as well as answering any questions or concerns. &quot;Our goal
is to call each student twice during their first year; collecting
this information will lend insight into increasing our
institutional effectiveness,&quot; says Sue Borrego, vice president for
student affairs.</p>
<p>Coordinated by staff member Rachelle Bass, the Call Center is
located in the Student Services Building (47). A student team has
been trained and will contact each new freshman and transfer
student. The information collected from these calls will be
evaluated to determine any themes and inform programs geared toward
increasing students&apos; success. First-Year Call Center team members
are Maria Ceja, Louie Okamoto, Isabel Lopez, Yandara
Rodriguez-Jacob, Marianne Roush, and Zachary Kasow. For any
questions concerning the Call Center, please contact Rachelle at
582-4160 or via e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Inter-Garrison Road closes for construction
work<br/></strong><img style="width:141px; height:153px" alt="Inter-Garrison" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/zzzzzzzzzzz%20intergarrison.bmp">Underground
hot water lines continue to be installed to distribute heat to
campus buildings. When the work is finished, dozens of old boilers
will be replaced by two new ones located in the Central Plant that
is currently under construction next to the VPA buildings. This
will result in energy savings for the campus. The installation work
along Divarty Street has been completed and the street is now open.
Work crews have moved to Inter-Garrison Road, starting at the
intersection with Fifth Avenue. The work will result in
Inter-Garrison being closed from Fifth Avenue to the north entrance
of Parking Lot 12. Work will continue west on Inter-Garrison to
Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Please follow the signs and look for
updates as the work progresses.</img></p>

<p><strong>Truths worth telling</strong><br>
<strong><em>Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg visits
campus Nov. 28<br/></em></strong>The President&apos;s Speakers Series
concludes this semester&apos;s presentations with a Nov. 28 visit by Dr.
<img style="width:215px; height:110px" alt="Pentaon Papers" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/ellsberg%202.bmp">
Daniel Ellsberg, the RANDCorp. analyst who, in 1971, leaked the
classified Pentagon Papers to the New York Times. The documents
revealed the U.S. government had engaged in a pattern of deceiving
the public about the number of Vietnam War casualties and the
nation&apos;s ability to win the war. And they instantly validated the
antiwar protest movement. He&apos;ll be talking about his book,
&quot;Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers,&quot; copies of
which will be available for sale. To reserve a seat for the free

<em>Cell phones transmit safety alerts at
CSUMB<br/></em></br></img></strong>Cell phones - a convenient way to send
greetings to friends and family via text messages - have been
transformed into campus communications vehicles. At CSUMB, the
service is called - what else? - OTTERalert. They blast out
campus-wide security and emergency communication alarms - a service
that has been getting a lot of attention since the tragic shootings
at Virginia Tech.<br>
The campus community can rest assured that OTTERalert is for
emergency alerts only; those who sign up will not receive spam.
Privacy is protected, and only campus administrators and members of
the University Police Department can originate the messages. To

<p><strong>ONGOING<br>
Through Nov. 26</br></strong>: Works by students in VPA 347 Chicana/o
Black Art taught by Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains and Professor Stephanie
A. Johnson is ondisplay in the library. Based on the Spanish Castas
paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries which categorized the
mestizaje or &quot;mixed race&quot; people into socially stratified
positions, the students&apos; &quot;remix&quot; focuses upon narratives of
familial legacy, ancestral exploration, and personal cross-cultural
negotiation. Using the original paintings as a background with
strategic alteration and addition of elements, these modern pieces
counter the divisions, legal inequities, and fears promoted by the
historical Castas paintings. The students developed their own
narratives and reflections of hope in the new Castas images.</p>

Students benefit from real-world experience</img></strong><br>
At CSUMB, much of the learning takes place in the real world. The
university partners with organizations that provide students the
opportunity to use the skills they&apos;ve acquired in the classroom,
make professional connections and build an impressive resume. One
of those organizations is the Defense Manpower Data Center. DMDC
and CSUMB have worked together since 1996, providing real-world
opportunities for students.</br></br></p>
<p>The two organizations recently signed an agreement to continue
working together. &quot;This is a very exciting event for me, our
campus, and most of all, our students,&quot; President Dianne F.
Harrison said at the signing ceremony. &quot;I talk about this To rread

experiences for students.&quot; To read more, <a href="real-world-experience.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A reminder</strong>: Fourth Avenue (the street behind
the Alumni and Visitors Center) between Divarty Street and
Inter-Garrison Road is ONE WAY southbound. There are no plans to
make the street two-way, even during the construction work in the
area. It&apos;s a safety issue - the street is too narrow to safely
accommodate two-way traffic and parking.</p>
<p>Divarty Street is now open.</p>
<p>Inter-Garrison Road is closed from Sixth Avenue to the north
entrance of parking lot 12. Fifth Avenue will be closed from
Inter-Garrison to the entrance to parking lot 12. The VPA buildings
are accessible via parking lot 71. Parking lot 12 is accessible
from A Street and Divarty Street.</p>
<p>Our campus is under construction. Please be cautious around
construction areas. We invite you to view this <a href="http://cdo.csumb.edu/site/x4929.xml%20" rel="nofollow">short slide

<p><strong>CSUMB heads to Santa Clara<br/></strong>It may have
been eight months ago, but the time between the end of last season
and the beginning of this one sure has seemed like an eternity for
CSU-Monterey Bay men&apos;s basketball coach Pat Kosta. &quot;We&apos;re finally
about to compete in a real game,&quot; said Kosta, who is in his second
year at the helm. . . &quot;We&apos;re ready to play.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>&apos;The Good Woman&apos; a gutsy undertaking for
CSUMB<br/></strong>It&apos;s a gutsy undertaking to stage Bertolt
Brecht&apos;s &quot;The Good Woman of Setzuan&quot; as the inaugural theater
offering for CSU-Monterey Bay&apos;s new Music and Performing Arts
Department. . .&quot;The Good Woman&quot; is free of charge, a gift to the
public from this new theater. (Professor Will) Shephard hs created
an intriguing theater experience in the old church. See for
yourself.<br>

<p><strong>Final two days to visit CSUMB
exhibitions<br/></strong>There&apos;s just time to catch Guardians and
Walking Through, two exhibitions of works by students at CSUMB.
These exhibits provide a propitious glimpse of what is being
created by the community&apos;s emerging artists. . . . These
exhibitions were curated by students of CSUMB&apos;s museum studies
program . . .<br>

<p><strong>Film explores transformation of Inland
area<br/></strong>There&apos;s a rare chance today to see Enid Baxter
Blader&apos;s &quot;Local 909er,&quot; an experimental documentary that explores
the rapid transformation of the Inland region from orchards and
dairy farms to box stores and McMansions. . . Blader, assistant
professor of digital cinema at Cal State Monterey Bay whose
artworks have been shown at MOCA and the Smithsonian, is a
filmmaker, painter, bluegrass singer and new mother with a family
emergency that will keep her from attending. The theme came to
Blader when she was living in Upland a few years ago and noticed
the disparity between the historic downtown and the hoopla
surrounding new developments. She began to wonder about the loss of
identity of place.<br>
