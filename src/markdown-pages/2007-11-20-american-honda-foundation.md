<p>The American Honda Foundation, a non-profit philanthropic
organization headquartered in Torrance, has made a $22,000 pledge
to support the Recruitment in Science Education Program (RISE) at
California State University, Monterey Bay. It&apos;s the first donation
the foundation has made to the university.</p>
<p>The RISE program encourages underrepresented high school
students from Marina and Salinas to expand their interest and
skills in science and provides the tools and inspiration to attend
college.</p>
<p>The American Honda Foundation was established in 1984 in
conjunction with American Honda&apos;s 25th anniversary in the United
States. It was established to say &quot;thank you&quot; to the American
people for their support through the years.<br>
<br>
The foundation makes grants to worthy non-profit causes, programs
and organizations that directly benefit the people of the United
States in the areas of youth education and scientific education.
Since its inception, it has provided more than $20 million in
grants.</br></br></p>
<p>Thanks to this support, the RISE program will continue to serve
local high school students with a mission of enhancing diversity in
the sciences.</p>
