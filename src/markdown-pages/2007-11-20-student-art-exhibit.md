4 p.m. The show will run through Feb. 1.
<p>&quot;Invoke: A Project to Invite Memory and Forgiveness&quot; is a
collaboration of the digital public art class. The show features
the documentation of eight site-specific art &quot;interventions&quot;
responding to memory and forgiveness. These interventions took
place in public spaces on Nov. 1 in observance of Day of the
Dead.</p>
<p>The second show, &quot;Community-Based Art: Social Change in Motion,&quot;
is the capstone project of Jessica Street. By looking at the work
being done in South Africa with HIV/AIDS patients, the power that
comes from the merging of creativity and community becomes
obvious.</p>
