<h4>Gift to help with library construction</h4>
<p>President Dianne F. Harrison has announced a $1 million grant
from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for the construction
of the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.</p>
<p>&quot;This leadership gift is a major vote of confidence in the
university,&quot; said Dr. Harrison. &quot;It represents the Foundation&apos;s
deep commitment toward student success, and it sends a strong
message to our community about the importance of private support
for the library.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Chapin, chair of CSUMB&apos;s President&apos;s Council, emphasized the
importance of this gift to the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The Packard Foundation&apos;s gift is key to assuring the finest
education for our children, grandchildren and beyond,&quot; said Mr.
Chapin, a regional business leader. &quot;Its investment in the Tanimura
&amp; Antle library reminds us of how vital it is that all of our
communities- university, friends, parents, alumni and
students&#xA0;- come together to support this crucial building
campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>With its stunning architecture, soaring atrium providing natural
light, and views to Monterey and the Salinas Valley, the library
will be the defining facility on campus, and a regional landmark.
In addition to its beautiful design and functionality, the building
will include a range of sustainable design features, including an
innovative climate control system that is expected to result in the
use of 28 percent less energy than California&apos;s latest energy code
requires.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to take a student-led tour of the library site
can arrange it by calling Steve Weldon, director of Planned Giving,
at 582-3070.</p>
<p>The Packard Foundation has been providing key financial support
to the university since CSUMB&apos;s first years. It was created in 1964
by David Packard, the co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company,
and Lucile Salter Packard. Throughout their lives in business and
philanthropy, the Packards sought to use private funds for the
public good, giving back to a society that enabled them to
prosper.</p>
<p>The Packard gift is a second major gift the university has
received recently. In October, Dr. Harrison announced that the late
Marian K. Krause, through her charitable trust and estate, left the
university $4 million to be used for scholarships.</p>
