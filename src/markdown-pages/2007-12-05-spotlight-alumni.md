<h4>Crystal Costa: Ready for prime time</h4>
<p>Crystal Costa is on the air. A 2007 graduate, she currently
reports for KJCT News 8 in Grand Junction, Colo., and hopes to
anchor one day.<br>
Getting to where she is took hard work every step of the way, even
though she didn&apos;t always know where she was going.</br></p>
<p>&quot;When I started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do,&quot;
says Crystal, who grew up in the Central Valley and admits she came
to CSUMB because she &quot;wanted to live at the beach.&quot; She majored in
Human Communication because &quot;my passion is writing and being around
people. I don&apos;t do math, science or many other subjects well, so it
was also a process of elimination.</p>
<p>&quot;I dabbled in everything; I took newspaper writing classes,
magazine writing, investigative journalism, and even radio
classes.&quot;</p>
<p>When it came time to choose a concentration, Crystal found the
help she needed from her adviser, Professor Juanita Darling. &quot;She
sat me down to really narrow my choices and decide what I should do
as a career.</p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s when I finally realized that news reporting is perfect
for me,&quot; says Crystal.</p>
<p>Crystal determined that an internship would be the best way to
get her foot in the door. &quot;I called KION 46 and KSBW both for a
month straight. I finally got a hold of KION and got an interview.
After interning for six months with them, they offered me a
position writing and producing KION 46 News at Noon. I was later
promoted to producing and writing the Morning News, and did that
for about a year.&quot;</p>
<p>On top of her internship, Crystal paid her own way through
school - never taking a loan - by working as a waitress. &quot;Working
five days a week, interning and finishing school was quite a task.
Sometimes I wasn&apos;t sure I could do everything, much less afford
everything. But the pressure really helped me build character and
made me realize that if you want something in life, you have to go
out and get it. No one is going to bring it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite juggling so much, Crystal maintained a 3.8 GPA and
graduated magna cum laude. She credits her teachers, friends,
boyfriend, and roommates for helping her make it through.</p>
<p>After working behind the scenes at KION for a year, Crystal
says, &quot;I was beyond ready to be on camera.&quot; She approached the
search for her next opportunity with the same persistence and
determination that got her the internship: &quot;I took video clip
samples of myself out in the field, and made them into a demo reel.
I then sent the reel out to 70 news stations.</p>
<p>&quot;I finally heard back from KJCT News 8. They had a reporter
opening and I moved out to Colorado from Monterey one month after I
was offered the position.&quot;</p>
<p>In her new position, Crystal goes out into the field to shoot
footage and interviews and then edits the pieces together back in
the studio. She also writes and delivers the stories on air. &quot;I get
to do something different every day. I meet new people and get to
tell their stories. And I actually feel like I&apos;m doing something
for the community.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ve had to pay my dues every step of the way, and really learn
the news industry from the core, but I&apos;m proud that I am doing what
I love to do. I always want to be fulfilled in my career and feel
like I am doing something that matters.&quot;</p>
