<h4>New theater director is multi-talented</h4>
<p>After a lengthy hiatus from CSUMB, Joe Cardinalli has returned
to the university as interim director of the World Theater.</p>
<p>He brings managerial skills to the position, but he&apos;s also a
designer, technical theater consultant, television field director
and a musician.</p>
<p>His introduction to Fort Ord came during the 1960s when he
played keyboard in a Monterey rock band. His band often played at
Stilwell Hall, entertaining troops bound for Vietnam.</p>
<p>In the late &apos;60s, he earned a degree in theater arts from San
Jos&#xE9; State, then went on to a 33-year career with the city of San
Jose in the department of parks, recreation and neighborhood
services. Before retiring earlier this year, he was the
department&apos;s deputy director, responsible for managing about 1,400
employees, a $60 million operating budget and a $500 million
capital budget.</p>
<p>&quot;With a degree in theater arts, I was asked to manage the
children&apos;s parks and zoo when I began working for the city,&quot; he
says. &quot;I then went on to manage special events for the city.&quot; Over
the years, he&apos;s managed events ranging from five to 100,000
attendees - and accumulated 35 years of theater experience.</p>
<p>Cardinalli was a founder of the city&apos;s Christmas in the Park -
one of the largest holiday displays west of the Mississippi. It
attracts about 500,000 people a month. He&apos;s also a founder of the
San Jose Holiday Parade, recognized as one of the top 25 parades in
the country.</p>
<p>He worked at CSUMB when Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology first
started, teaching a theater production class. Nowadays, he teaches
a television production class once a week at Gavilan College in
Gilroy. He&apos;s been on the board of directors of El Theatro Campesino
in San Juan Bautista for 10 years. He designs many of its shows,
including Zoot Suit, which recently concluded a run.</p>
<p>&quot;All my life I&apos;ve done theater - I&apos;ve never stopped. I&apos;ve gone
the whole circle and now I&apos;ve been able to make the circle back to
Monterey and work with the great staff at the World Theater.&quot;</p>
<p>Cardinalli recognizes the administrative and creative challenges
of running the campus theater. &quot;The key is to analyze the audiences
to find out what they really want. We&apos;ve already done an audience
survey at the last performance and got back a third of them.
Surveys will tell us if we&apos;re targeting the right people. That is,
are we giving audiences what they want?</p>
<p>&quot;We need community support. I&apos;ve been successful at other places
where we involved the community. We have to serve both the
community and the university. That&apos;s the balance we need to achieve
over time for the World Theater.&quot;</p>
<p>He sums up his goal for the World Theater in a sentence:
&quot;Smiling faces after a performance are my reward.&quot;<br/></p>
