<p>The voice of James Earl Jones echoed through a Long Beach
library on Dec. 10 as the actor - who voiced Darth Vader in &quot;Star
Wars&quot; - read to a group of fourth-graders.</p>
<p>Jones visited the library to help promote a project involving
CSUMB, Verizon and the Long Beach school system.</p>
<p>The partners are exploring ways in which the resources available
through Verizon&apos;s educational website, Thinkfinity.org, can aid
classroom teachers.</p>
<p>The free, interactive website provides more than 55,000
educational resources, including grade-specific K-12 lesson plans
and materials for teachers.</p>
<p>Verizon selected CSUMB to lead the project, which will initially
focus on elementary schools in Long Beach and is intended to become
a model for integrating content from Thinkfinity.org into school
curricula across California.</p>
<p>Experts from CSUMB&apos;s Instructional Design and Technology Lab
will show teachers how to navigate the website and incorporate
material into their classrooms.</p>
<p>The ID&amp;T Lab researches and tests new hardware and software
tools to determine their potential for enhancing and transforming
education. The lab seeks methods to assist educators in
&quot;connecting&quot; with students despite barriers of geography and
diverse learning styles.</p>
<p>The lab is also a prototyping space for technologies,
applications, programmatic initiatives, and for research design.
And the lab provides training in new technologies and assists
faculty members in incorporating innovative tools within their
teaching.</p>
<p>John Ittelson is director of the lab and professor in the School
of Information Technology and Communications Design. Barbara Starr
is senior project manager for the Thinkfinity Project.</p>
