<h4>CSUMB students&apos; skateboard film set to premiere</h4>
<p>&quot;No Excuses, Just Hungry,&quot; a skateboarding film by a pair of
California State University, Monterey Bay students, will have its
debut showing on Dec. 7 in Salinas.</p>
<p>Jared Nelson and Michael Oates-Kealey, students in the
university&apos;s Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology, shot
most of the footage in Salinas, Monterey, Marina and Seaside.</p>
<p>The pair, both 21, worked on the film for three years. Capturing
the fast-paced action was a real test of their filmmaking skills -
some of the shots involved the filmmakers riding their own
skateboards while holding the camera.</p>
<p>Although the film was not a class assignment, Nelson and
Oates-Kealey said their CSUMB courses strengthened their filmmaking
skills.</p>
<p>The film will be shown at 7 p.m., Dec. 7 at the Salinas Moose
Lodge, 111 Monterey St. Admission is free.<br/></p>
