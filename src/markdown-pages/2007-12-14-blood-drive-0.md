Forty students, staff and faculty members turned out to donate
blood Wednesday, despite the crush of end-of-semester work.
<p>A donor team staffed by the American Red Cross spent the
afternoon in the Alumni and Visitors Center as part of its holiday
blood drive.</p>
<p>They collected 30 units of blood. Some potential donors had to
be turned away (or &quot;deferred,&quot; as the Red Cross staff members said)
for a variety of reasons - they&apos;ve had a tattoo recently, they had
a low blood count, were getting over a cold, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;We were pleased with the turnout,&quot; said Sherrie Pfefferkorn,
charge nurse with the Red Cross. &quot;We definitely plan on doing this
again.&quot;</p>
<p>Pfefferkorn explained that a unit of blood can potentially save
three lives. Each donation is broken down into blood&apos;s component
parts of plasma, hemoglobin and platelets. And each component can
benefit a different person.</p>
<p>Blood donation is an important way for healthy people to help
their community. Blood cannot be manufactured; the only way to keep
up with the demand is through regular donations from healthy
volunteer donors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone should help someone in some way. This is one
of the easiest ways I can help someone,&quot; said freshman Emily
Selander.</p>
<p>Other members of the campus community agreed.</p>
<p>Said Elizabeth Valle, a freshman VPA major, &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted
to give blood. This is my first time. And it was easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Donors showed up all afternoon. So many had made reservations
online that no walk-ups could be accommodated. Despite the
efficient operation, donors were still being processed more than an
hour after the 3 p.m. advertised closing.</p>
<p>Anyone who missed the chance to donate can visit the Blood Donor
Center of Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, 576
Hartnell St., Monterey. To make an appointment, call 625-4814.</p>
<p>The blood drive was co-sponsored by Omega Delta Phi-AK and its
service chair, Efren Camacho; the Campus Health Center; and the
Alumni and Visitors Center.</p>
<p>The Red Cross will be back on campus four times in 2008: Feb.
20, April 23, Sept. 10 and Dec. 10.</p>
