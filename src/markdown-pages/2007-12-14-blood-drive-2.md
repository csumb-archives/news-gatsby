<p>Forty students, staff and faculty members of California State
University, Monterey Bay turned out to donate blood Dec. 12,
despite the crush of end-of-semester work.</p>
<p>A donor team staffed by the American Red Cross spent the
afternoon in the Alumni and Visitors Center as part of its holiday
blood drive.</p>
<p>They collected 30 units of blood. Some potential donors had to
be turned away (or &quot;deferred,&quot; as the Red Cross staff members said)
for a variety of reasons - they&apos;ve had a tattoo recently, they had
a low blood count, were getting over a cold, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;We were pleased with the turnout,&quot; said Sherrie Pfefferkorn,
charge nurse with the Red Cross. &quot;We definitely plan on doing this
again.&quot;</p>
<p>Blood donation is an important way for healthy people to help
their community. Blood cannot be manufactured; the only way to keep
up with the demand is through regular donations from healthy
volunteer donors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone should help someone in some way. This is one
of the easiest ways I can help someone,&quot; said freshman Emily
Selander.</p>
<p>The blood drive was co-sponsored by Omega Delta Phi-AK
fraternity and its service chair, Efren Camacho; the Campus Health
Center; and the Alumni and Visitors Center.</p>
