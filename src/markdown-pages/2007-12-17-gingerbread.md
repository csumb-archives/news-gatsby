The team from Conference and Event Services was serious about their
entry in the university&apos;s annual gingerbread house-building
contest&#xA0;- an elaborate replica of St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral in
Moscow.
<p>Really serious.</p>
<p>Serious enough to buy and construct a 3-D puzzle of the
cathedral. &quot;Then, we went online and found the floor plan,&quot; said
Lianne Minemoto. &quot;We knew where all the domes were located.&quot;</p>
<p>The cathedral was in keeping with the contest theme of &quot;It&apos;s a
Small World&#xA0;- Campus Edition.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of the other structures featured shredded wheat and potato
chip roofs, melted Lifesaver ponds and marshmallow cream
mortar.</p>

<p>And most of the gingerbread creations weren&apos;t mere houses. There
was the ocean scene, featuring a research vessel from the
university&apos;s Seafloor Mapping Lab around the theme &quot;Mapping the
World for Conservation&quot;; an Egyptian holiday scene including a
pyramid and camels; the North Pole, with a plea to &quot;Stop Global
Warming&quot;; a pagoda made with seaweed and chocolate; an adobe
structure; and &quot;Frohe Weihnachten&quot; a replica of a traditional
German Christmas decoration.</p>

The gingerbread house-building venture came out of a discussion
among members of the holiday party planning committee four years
ago. They hit upon the idea of having the campus community build
the houses and then using them for centerpieces at the annual
party. This year, 12 teams&#xA0;- including more than 60 employees
-participated in the competition.

Each group was given a kit consisting of the basic pieces and
encouraged to let their imaginations run wild. The only rule&#xA0;-
everything had to be edible.<br>
<p>The competition demonstrated that you don&apos;t have to be a pastry
chef to build a great gingerbread house.</p>
