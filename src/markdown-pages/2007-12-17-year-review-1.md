<p>More students, more outside support, a commitment to the
environment and a full-fledged senior leadership team marked 2007
at CSUMB.</p>

In the fall, the university welcomed its largest freshman class
ever - a 44 percent increase over 2006. And more than 400 transfer
students - most from the tri-county area - elected to attend CSUMB.
Overall, 30 percent more students were enrolled than the year
before.
<p>As the number of students grew, so did the private and
government support for the university.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30, CSUMB raised $6.8 million
from philanthropic foundations and individuals in our
community.</p>
<p>Among the major gifts received in 2007 were $4 million from the
charitable trust and estate of the late Marian Krause to provide
scholarships for students in the journalism and human communication
programs; $1 million from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation
for library construction; and $620,000 from the Monterey Peninsula
Foundation ($500,000 for the library and the rest for
athletics).</p>
<p>The private funding total does not include government grants and
contracts. In that category, CSUMB faculty and administrators were
very successful, securing a variety of funding, including:<br>
<br>
-An $880,000 federal McNair Scholars grant to help students from
underrepresented backgrounds prepare for doctoral studies<br>
&#xA0;-A $2 million federal CAMP grant aimed at enrolling more
migrant students in higher education<br>
&#xA0;-A $600,000 federal HUD grant awarded to the Service Learning
Institute to help revitalize&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Chinatown in
Salinas<br>
-$3.5 million brought in by the Seafloor Mapping Lab directed by
Rikk Kvitek to launch the first phase of the California
State-Waters Mapping Program.</br></br></br></br></br></p>

In response to our environmentally conscious campus and in
recognition of our responsibility to the environment we live in,
President Dianne Harrison signed the American College and
University Presidents Climate Commitment, which obligates schools
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and educate about
sustainability.
<p>The commitment requires signatories to set specific, measurable
goals within a definite time frame, and to incorporate proven
models for achieving a lighter carbon footprint. CSUMB promised to
have a concrete action plan in place within two years. A
campus-wide committee has been established to develop such a
plan.</p>
<p>Environmental issues also figured into construction work on
campus, as well as deconstruction.</p>
<p>Our telecommunications infrastructure upgrade centralized the
campus phone switches and data servers in a new IT building while
vastly improving Sixth Avenue by relocating power underground,
removing old poles and overhead lines, adding new light fixtures,
improving the landscaping in front of the University Center, and
coloring and stamping the roadway to mark the pedestrian section of
the road.</p>
<p>The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library currently under
construction is now visible as part of the skyline. It&apos;s on
schedule to be completed next fall and open in January of 2009.
Built to LEED silver standards, the building includes a range of
sustainable design features, including an innovative climate
control system that is expected to result in the use of 28 percent
less energy than California&apos;s latest energy code requires.</p>
<p>Work continues of a central plant that will supply hot water for
radiant heat to buildings located in the central campus. The pipes
that need to be installed for this project have required campus
roads to be closed for part of the year.</p>
<p>Dozens of unusable buildings inherited from Fort Ord were
deconstructed, which also improved the face of campus. About 90
percent of the materials were recycled, keeping thousands of tons
of material from the waste stream.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison completed her senior leadership team when Jack
Jewett, vice president for University Advancement, and Jim Main,
vice president for Administration and Finance, joined the
campus.</p>
<p>Among the year&apos;s other highlights:</p>
<p>-&#xA0;President Harrison presided over her first commencement
in May, when 700 students received degrees. The event marked Dr.
Harrison&apos;s investiture as the university&apos;s second president. CSU
Chancellor Charles Reed was on hand to charge her with the
responsibilities of office. &quot;Today, we formally welcome to the CSU
system and to CSUMB, a woman of commitment, drive and passion,&quot;
said Chancellor Reed. As he placed the presidential medallion
around her neck, Dr. Reed continued, &quot;I commit to your hands the
leadership of CSUMB.&quot;</p>
<p>-&#xA0;In March, the Center for Reading Diagnosis and
Instruction opened in a fully refurbished Army building. Thanks to
a $2.5 million anonymous gift, this center now serves the entire
community by providing reading diagnosis and instruction for K-12
students; training teachers in language, reading, and literacy; and
involving CSUMB students as tutors.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;The university secured full NCAA Division II membership,
one year early. Division II brings the best of collegiate
competition, a true partnership between academics and athletics,
and a real appreciation for the student-athlete.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;The new softball and baseball fields have been completed
and the teams are already practicing on them. Renovations to the
fieldhouse have been completed.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;The President&apos;s Speakers Series was launched in the
spring and continued during the fall semester to create discussion
around important topics. Following a successful spring slate of
speakers - Kwame Anthony Appiah, Riane Eisler and Esera Tuaolo -
the fall series filled the World Theater with campus and community
members who came to hear Philip Zimbardo, Mark Becker and Daniel
Ellsberg.</p>
<p>Students and the community also had the opportunity to hear
anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, internationally acclaimed artist
Carrie Mae Weems and poet Nikki Giovanni as they all visited campus
during the year.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;New undergraduate majors were added in biology and
psychology.</p>
<p>-&#xA0;The non-profit Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI)
was established through CSUMB&apos;s Office of Extended Education. The
institute&apos;s programs are intended to address the intellectual needs
of the over-50 population, forming a dynamic community of adults
dedicated to lifelong learning.<br>
-&#xA0;The Energy Innovations Fund, an idea put forth by students
to implement sustainability projects on campus, earned a Best
Practices award at the statewide CSU/UC Sustainability Conference.
As its first project, the fund helped finance conversion of the
Otter Sports Center lighting from high-pressure sodium lights to
efficient linear fluorescent fixtures.</br></p>
<p>-&#xA0;The Alumni Association held a Pioneer Reunion for members
of the classes of 1996-2000. More than 100 of those early graduates
returned to campus for the event.<br>
-&#xA0;Work continued on the Chinatown Renewal Project, a
multi-year community planning effort led by CSUMB to clean up,
revitalize and redevelop an eight-block area north of the downtown
area of Salinas.<br>
-&#xA0;For the fourth straight year, the service learning program
was recognized by the editors of U.S. News &amp; World Report in
the magazine&apos;s America&apos;s Best Colleges issue. The magazine named
&quot;programs to look for,&quot; which it defines as &quot;outstanding examples
of academic programs that are believed to lead to student success.&quot;
CSUMB&apos;s service learning program was listed among the top programs
in the country&#xA0;and is one of only 14 public schools included
in the ranking.</br></br></p>
<p>In the year to come, an Executive MBA program will get under
way, work will continue on a new strategic plan for the university,
the Tanimura &amp; Antle library will be completed and planning
will start for the next new academic building.</p>
