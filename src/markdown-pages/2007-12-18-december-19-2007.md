building boom</img></strong><br>
The team from Conference and Event Services was serious about their
entry in the university&apos;s annual gingerbread house-building contest
- an elaborate replica of St. Basil&apos;s Cathedral in Moscow. Really
serious. Serious enough to buy and construct a 3-D puzzle of the
cathedral. &quot;Then, we went online and found the floor plan,&quot; said
Lianne Minemoto. &quot;We knew where all the domes were located.&quot; The
cathedral was in keeping with the contest theme of &quot;It&apos;s a Small
World - Campus Edition.&quot; Some of the other structures featured
shredded wheat and potato chip roofs, melted Lifesaver ponds and
marshmallow cream mortar. Some of the gingerbread creations weren&apos;t
mere houses. There was the ocean scene, featuring a research vessel
from the university&apos;s Seafloor Mapping Lab around the theme
&quot;Mapping the World for Conservation&quot;; an Egyptian holiday scene
including a pyramid and camels; the North Pole, with a plea to
&quot;Stop Global Warming&quot;; a pagoda made with seaweed and chocolate; an
adobe structure; and &quot;Frohe Weihnachten&quot; a replica of a traditional
German Christmas decoration. That one, by Team University
Advancement, took top honors. To see more photos, <a href="gingerbread.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</br></p>

supports blood drive<br/></img></strong>Forty students, staff and
faculty members turned out to donate blood last Wednesday, despite
the crush of end-of-semester work. A donor team staffed by the
American Red Cross spent the afternoon in the Alumni and Visitors
Center as part of its holiday blood drive. They collected 30 units
of blood. Some potential donors had to be turned away (or
&quot;deferred,&quot; as the Red Cross staff members said) for a variety of
reasons - they&apos;ve had a tattoo recently, they had a low blood
count, were getting over a cold, etc. &quot;We were pleased with the
turnout,&quot; said Sherrie Pfefferkorn, charge nurse with the Red
Cross. &quot;We definitely plan on doing this again.&quot; The blood drive
was co-sponsored by Omega Delta Phi-AK and its service chair, Efren
Camacho; the Campus Health Center; and the Alumni and Visitors
Center. To read more, <a href="blood-drive-0.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Year in Review</strong><br>
More students, more outside support, a commitment to the
environment and a full-fledged senior leadership team marked 2007
at CSUMB.<br>
In the fall, the university welcomed its largest freshman class
ever -a 44 percent increase over 2006. And more than 400 transfer
students -most from the tri-county area- elected to attend CSUMB.
Overall, 30 percent more students were enrolled than the year
before. As the number of students grew, so did the private and
government support for the university. For the fiscal year ending
June 30, CSUMB raised $6.8 million from philanthropic foundations
and individuals in our community. Among the major gifts received in
2007 were $4 million from the charitable trust and estate of the
late Marian Krause to provide scholarships for students in the
journalism and human communication programs; $1 million from the
David and Lucile Packard Foundation for library construction; and
$620,000 from the Monterey Peninsula Foundation ($500,000 for the
library and the rest for athletics). To read more, <a href="year-review-1.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</br></br></p>

a fresh idea to students<br/></img></strong>The Monterey County Farm to
School Partnership will continue its work in the new year,
collaborating with local schools to teach children about where
their food comes from and why it&apos;s important to eat healthy. The
partnership, based at the Watershed Institute, has built and
maintained school gardens, led hundreds of kids on farm field
trips, and changed policies to improve food served in school
cafeterias. The partnership aims to expand its programs in 2008
with the support of the Monterey County Weekly Community Fund. For
the past four years, the Weekly has been its main supporter,
contributing over $275,000. It has a goal of raising $65,000 by
Dec. 31. To help the Weekly help the Farm to School Partnership,
tax-deductible contributions can be mailed to Monterey County
Weekly Community Fund, 668 Williams Ave., Seaside 93955.</p>
<p><strong>Txt Msgs Alert U</strong><br>
<strong><em>Cell phones transmit safety alerts at
CSUMB<br/></em></strong>&#x2022; Cell phones - a convenient way to send
greetings to friends and family via text messages - have been
transformed into campus communications vehicles. At CSUMB, the
service is called - what else? - OTTERalert. They blast out
campus-wide security and emergency communication alarms - a service
that has been getting a lot of attention since the tragic shootings
at Virginia Tech.<br>
The campus community can rest assured that OTTERalert is for
emergency alerts only; those who sign up will not receive spam.
Privacy is protected, and only campus administrators and members of
the University Police Department can originate the messages. To

for America to be held on Jan. 31. It&apos;s a nationwide event, taking
place at over 1,100 college campuses with over a million students
expected to attend. CSUMB is hosting a local event from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. that day in the University Center conference rooms.</img></p>
<p>Local elected officials Dennis Donohue and Fred Keeley will
attend. Faculty members have signed up to give presentations on a
variety of topics. The CSUMB Associated Students and Academic
Senate have endorsed the event. For a preliminary schedule of
events, visit csumb.edu/green.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A reminder: Fourth Avenue (the street behind the Alumni and
Visitors Center) between Divarty Street and Inter-Garrison Road is
ONE WAY southbound. There are no plans to make the street two-way,
even during the construction work in the area. It&apos;s a safety issue
- the street is too narrow to safely accommodate two-way traffic
and parking.</p>
<p>Divarty Street is now open.</p>
<p>Inter-Garrison Road is closed from Sixth Avenue to the entrance
to parking lot 12. Fifth Avenue is closed from Inter-Garrison to
the entrance to parking lot 12. The VPA buildings are accessible
via parking lot 71. Parking lot 12 is accessible from A Street and
Divarty Street.</p>
<p>Our campus is under construction. Please be cautious around
construction areas. We invite you to view this <a href="http://cdo.csumb.edu/site/x4929.xml%20" rel="nofollow">short slide

<p><strong>Arteaga gets a shot with
Earthquakes<br/></strong>Robert Arteaga remembers the feeling when
he got an e-mail last week from the San Jose Earthquakes inviting
him for Round 2 of tryouts. Excited, then overwhelmed. Arteaga was
one of five people picked from the Salinas tryout to participate in
the Quakes&apos; combine Dec. 20-22. Arteaga is a former goalkeeper for
California State University, Monterey Bay. Said his college coach,
Artie Cairel, &quot;Robert is a tremendous athlete and possesses
cat-like reflexes. . . He most certainly could play his way on to a
roster spot.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Like the Back of His Hand - Professor dedicates himself
to learning all he can about Elkhorn Slough</strong><br>
Rikk Kvitek knows nearly every inch of Elkhorn Slough. For the past
25 years, Kvitek, a CSUMB science and environmental policy
professor, has been studying environmental changes in the slough
and surrounding wetlands. &quot;The loss of salt marshes is something we
discovered back in the &apos;80s,&quot; Kvitek says. So he and his students
began bathymetric mapping, measuring the water depth, to create a
surface model of the slough.<br>

<p><strong>Hands of Health</strong><br>
Students in the digital art class at CSUMB have partnered with
health workers from the Center for Community Advocacy to produce
materials - a billboard in Salinas, a photonovela and postcards -
all containing information helpful to farm laborers. The CCA workes
are distributing the information.<br>

<p><strong>CSUMB cagers show integrity</strong><br>
On Dec. 5, the Division I men&apos;s basketball team from California
State University, Fresno was within seconds of being upset by
Division II&apos;s California State University, Monterey Bay, but
managed to prevail. What makes this so interesting is that CUMB, a
small univesity, even with the loss, communicated that inegrity
matters.<br>

<p><strong>Verizon brings educational resources of Thinkfinity.org
to elementary school classrooms</strong><br>
Verizon and the Long Beach Education Foundation are embarking on a
project to explore ways in which the treasure trove of educational
resources available through Verizon&apos;s free and innovative
Thinkfinity.org Web site can enrich the learning experience in
elementary school classrooms. Legendary actor James Earl Jones,
Verizon&apos;s longtime partner in promoting literacy, participated in
the launch of the project at Long Beach&apos;s Mark Twain Library by
reading &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; to a group of 4th-grade students
from Tincher Preparatory School. Verizon has named California State
University, Monterey Bay to lead the project, which will initially
focus on elementary schools in Long Beach and is intended to become
a model for integrating content from Thinkfinity.org into
elementary school curricula in classrooms across California.<br>

<p><strong>Member Spotlight</strong><br>
California State University, Monterey Bay is our current spotlight
campus! Because CSUMB is located on the former Fort Ord Army base,
many military buildings are being deconstructed to implement the
campus master plan. Over 90% of the material from these buildings
is recycled, reused and kept from the waste stream.<br>

Education e-newsletter</em>, Dec. 7, 2007<br/></br></br></p>
