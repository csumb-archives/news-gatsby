Harrison&apos;s Speaker Series.
<p>Alexie, who was honored for his highly autobiographical novel
for young people, &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time
Indian,&quot; will visit campus April 15.</p>
<p>He credits a creative writing teacher at Washington State
University, who gave him an anthology of American Indian writing.
In the two decades since then, he&apos;s written 19 books of fiction,
poetry and essays, although &quot;Absolutely True Diary&quot; is his first
work for young adults.</p>
<p>A Spokane/Coeur d&apos;Alene Indian, Alexie, 41, has also had a
successful career as a playwright, filmmaker and teacher, and other
books and films have drawn on his Indian heritage. But, he told the
Seattle Times, &quot;Absolutely True Diary&quot; may be the book that&apos;s
closest to the life he led.</p>
<p>&quot;I was afraid of my own history,&quot; he said in an interview posted
on the National Book Awards website. Yet he overcame his anxiety to
write of his life in a book that has riveted adolescents.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of brown-skinned teenagers who have embraced the
book is so great,&quot; he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. &quot;One kid
told me, &apos;This is like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for minorities,&apos; and

makes it feel like that&apos;s true.&quot;
<p>The spring series gets under way on Feb. 6 with a talk by Dr.
Robert Curry, research science professor at UC-Santa Cruz. His
topic will be &quot;It&apos;s All About Water: The Coming Water Crisis in
California and the Nation.&quot; Dr. Curry has served on commissions
organized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, California
Department of Forestry, and the U.S. Forest Service. His recent
research includes studies of estuarine and freshwater stream
restoration projects.</p>
<p>On Feb. 20, Thomas DeWolf will visit campus to talk about his
efforts to confront his family&apos;s history of slave-trading in his
memoir, &quot;Inheriting the Trade.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2001, at the age of 47, DeWolf was astounded to discover that
he was related to the most successful slave-trading family in
American history, a family that was responsible for transporting at
least 10,000 Africans to the Americas.</p>
<p>His memoir recounts the journey of 10 of his family members as
they retraced the steps of their ancestors through the notorious
Triangle Trade -from New England to</p>

West Africa to Cuba.
<p>The trip proved to be life-altering, forcing DeWolf to face the
horrors of slavery and feelings of shame, white male privilege, the
complicity of churches, America&apos;s historic amnesia regarding
slavery, and the nation&apos;s desperate need for healing.</p>
<p>It also inspired him to contend with the complicated legacy that
continues to affect black and white Americans, Africans and Cubans
today. &quot;Inheriting the Trade&quot; provides a persuasive argument that
the legacy of slavery isn&apos;t merely a Southern issue, but an
enduring American one.</p>
<p>The series will continue on March 13 when Dr. Sharon Hays talks
about women and welfare.</p>

<p>Dr. Hays is the Barbra Streisand Professor in Contemporary
