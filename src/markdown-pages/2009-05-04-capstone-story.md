Monterey Bay will hold its 13th annual Capstone Festival starting
on May 8 with the Policy Forum, presented by graduating students in
the Master of Public Policy program. The forum will take place from
2 to 5 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center.</img></p>
<p>Each spring, the CSUMB Capstone Festival celebrates the
culminating projects of graduating seniors, credential candidates,
and master&apos;s students as they present their work in sessions held
by each academic department.</p>
<p>These projects reflect the knowledge, skills, and abilities
developed over the course of a student&apos;s experience at CSUMB. They
include research presentations, original poetry, oral histories,
art projects, performances, tabletop exhibits, films and videos,
multimedia works, computer visualizations, and more.</p>
<p>The projects are designed to showcase topics and ideas that
students are passionate about, as well as to reflect the breadth of
knowledge that they have gained over their time at the
university</p>
<p>The festival kicks into high gear on May 14, when students from
seven academic departments showcase their work. The festival
continues with presentations the next day, and concludes with the
Teledramatic Arts and Technology showcase from 6 to 9 p.m. in the
World Theater.</p>
<p>All events are open to the public. For more information or to
