<h4>CSUMB receives national accreditation for School of
Education</h4>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay&apos;s School of Education
has earned national accreditation.</p>
<p>The university played host to a team of evaluators from the
National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) in
December 2008. The evaluators spent three days on campus, reviewing
the Multiple Subject, Single Subject, Special Education, and
Master&apos;s of Arts in Education programs, and meeting with students,
faculty members, administrators and local school administrators who
work as partners with CSU Monterey Bay in preparing future
teachers.</p>
<p>The visit was the culmination of two years of preparatory work
by CSU Monterey Bay faculty and staff who prepare future teachers
for the classroom. Evaluators awarded national accreditation
effective immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;NCATE accreditation recognizes the professionalism, competence
and quality work put forth by our faculty and staff, as well as the
quality of our student candidates&apos; experiences in the field with
our partner schools and teachers,&quot; said Brian Simmons, dean of the
College of Professional Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows that our faculty are well-qualified and experienced in
their fields, that our educational partners provide outstanding
support for our student candidates, and that our teacher
preparation programs are doing a great job preparing future
teachers based upon national and state standards.&quot;</p>
<p>To meet NCATE standards, universities must offer intellectually
rigorous standards-based programs relevant to the needs of today&apos;s
classrooms. To the public, accreditation means that the school
underwent rigorous external review by an external group of
professionals, meeting the national and state standards set by the
teaching field at large, including classroom teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;National accreditation causes one to continually assess one&apos;s
programs and constantly seek improvement,&quot; Dr. Simmons said of the
process. The university will continue to submit annual reports to
NCATE and will go through the formal visitation process again when
the accreditation expires. For information on the California State
