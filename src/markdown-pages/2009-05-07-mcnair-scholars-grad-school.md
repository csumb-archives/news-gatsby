<h4>McNair Scholars prepare for grad school<br>
<em>Soaring toward advanced degrees on astronaut&apos;s legacy</em></br></h4>
<p>For some college students, summer is a time to put the books
away for a few months.</p>

group of CSU Monterey Bay students who will spend their summer
conducting experiments, gathering data and summarizing their
scientific findings in research papers.</img></p>
<p>All 25 of the students in CSUMB&apos;s McNair Scholars program have
summer research projects lined up. Some of them will work with
professors on campus, some will head off to other universities and
research facilities to do their work.</p>
<p>The McNair Scholars program started last year at CSUMB, funded
through the Ronald McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program of
the U.S. Department of Education. The goal of the program, named
for an African-American astronaut and physicist who died in the
Challenger disaster in 1986, is to increase the number of
underrepresented, low income and first-generation college students
who earn doctoral degrees. The students come from across the
academic spectrum - the sciences, humanities and social
sciences.</p>
<p>&quot;Undergraduate research is the launching platform for a lifetime
of learning and creative activity,&quot; said Professor William Head,
director of the program. &quot;Through undergraduate research our
Scholars are making the link between their classroom and the wider
world.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the summer research opportunities, the McNair
Scholars work with faculty mentors, receive academic support
services, visit graduate schools and receive help with the graduate
school application process. They also benefit from guest lecturers,
workshops and a research methods seminar.</p>

group will graduate on May 16. A new crop of students, who join
those continuing with the program, has replaced them. The graduates
and the new students were introduced at an event on May 5.</img></p>
<p>&quot;For most of us, it was the professors who got us through,&quot;
graduating senior Angelica Plascencia said. &quot;Before I became a
McNair Scholar, I didn&apos;t know what a Ph.D. was.&quot;</p>
<p>She does now - the social and behavioral sciences major has been
accepted into a doctoral program at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>McNair Scholars program manager Jessica Brown gave each of the
seven graduates a blue cord to wear at commencement. &quot;This is a
tradition we&apos;re starting,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ll see more of them in the
future.&quot;</p>
