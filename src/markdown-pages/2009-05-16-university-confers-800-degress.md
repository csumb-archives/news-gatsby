Suarez told the graduates of California State University, Monterey
Bay that the world they are about to enter needs their energy and
their curiosity.</img></p>
<p>Suarez, a Washington-based senior correspondent for public
television&apos;s national news program, The NewsHour, was the keynote
speaker at the university&apos;s May 16 commencement. With more than 880
students receiving bachelor&apos;s and master&apos;s degrees, and about 100
earning teaching credentials, it was the largest graduating class
in school history.</p>
<p>After receiving an honorary doctor of humane letters conferred
by President Dianne Harrison, Suarez commended the graduates for
taking advantage of their opportunity to earn a degree.</p>
<p><img alt="President Harrison" height="234" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/President-Harrison_wcaption.png" style="float:right" width="275">&quot;Whatever road you took to get
here today, the vast majority of your peers did not do it. You were
not deterred by the difficulties of getting to this day . . . You
had an opportunity and you built something with that opportunity -
yourself,&quot; he said. And while acknowledging the challenging economy
the graduates are facing, he told them, &quot;I&apos;m not afraid for you
because of what you&apos;ve already shown the people around you simply
by making it to this morning.&quot;</img></p>
<p>He gave a special acknowledgment to the students who started
life somewhere else, or whose parents did.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a vindication of the faith your family had in coming
here in the first place. You are confirmation that America is a
transformative place . . . but America will also be transformed by
you. So thanks for making it all the way to the finish line,&quot;
Suarez said.</p>
<p>Then he posed the question, &quot;Why did you finish? Why?&quot;</p>
<p>He acknowledged the emphasis society places on a college
education as the route to a better paycheck, but urged the
graduates to think of it as more than a means to make a living.</p>
<p><img alt="Graduates" height="279" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/2009Graduates.png" style="float:left" width="375">&quot;I hope you get your diploma today
with the satisfaction that comes from something more than just
anticipating money. The curriculum, the critical thinking skills .
. . those things weren&apos;t just about making you more employable.</img></p>
<p>&quot;If the place did its job as an institution, and you did your
job as students, your years of school have taught you how to learn
for life. And that makes the world a much better place to be.&quot;</p>
<p>He challenged the students to see the possibilities the world
offers and to be excited by them.</p>
<p>&quot;Make me a promise,&quot; he asked the graduates, &quot;or better yet,
make yourselves a promise. &#x2018;I&apos;m not going to be bored.&apos; The world
is way too exciting, challenging, puzzling, fascinating ever to be
bored. And if you keep that promise to yourself not to be bored,
you won&apos;t be boring, either.</p>
<p>&quot;Continue to learn. Teach others. Be a student for life. . .
.This country needs your energy and your curiosity and your
soul.&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="Hugs" height="232" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/2009hugs.png" style="float:right" width="375">He reminded the graduates that
the world they are entering is one that moves at a very fast pace,
where boundaries no longer exist, where communication is
instantaneous.</img></p>
<p>&quot;It really is exciting, the possibilities in this new world.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&apos;t be bored, and don&apos;t be boring.&quot;</p>
<p>This year&apos;s President&apos;s Medal for Exemplary Student Achievement
went to Richard Welshiemer, a Human Communication major who served
as editor of the student newspaper, the Otter Realm, and who was a
Service Learning Student Leader.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things I learned here is to take time to reflect
before taking action,&quot; Welshiemer told the gathering. &quot;What is
CSUMB about if not outcomes?&quot;</p>
<p>In her opening remarks, President Harrison pointed out that the
graduating class &quot;boasts an amazing array of talent. Many have
overcome enormous challenges, attaining academic success, achieving
as athletes, receiving prestigious honors, and sharing their gifts
and abilities with fellow students and the community, as well.
Their success is incredibly rewarding.&quot;</p>

these students:</img></p>
<p>&#x2022; Richard Brumbaugh, a staff sergeant on active reserve in the
U.S. Air Force. Richard is graduating in Business Administration.
He spent his summers and school breaks meeting his commitment to
military service, including a tour of duty last summer in Iraq -
his second stint in that country. Because his deployment required
him to leave school a little early, Richard actually took a final
exam while deployed in the war zone. And he STILL made the dean&apos;s
list. He&apos;s volunteered for another deployment, this time to
Afghanistan. Today is Armed Forces Day, so it is all the more
fitting that we recognize Richard&apos;s service, along with that of at
least seven military veterans who are among our graduates.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Angelica Plascencia started her American education in the
eighth grade. Every morning, she crossed the border from Tijuana to
attend school in San Diego County. At the time, Angelica spoke
little English and had to navigate the border crossing on her own.
That experience - of straddling two nations and two cultures - has
shaped her research interest. Angelica is majoring in Social and
Behavioral Science. She has been accepted into the anthropology
program in Mexican-American Borderlands at the University of Texas,
where she will pursue a Ph.D. starting in the fall.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Martin Vargas-Garcia is graduating with a double major in
Visual and Public Art and Business Administration. Martin combined
his artistic skills and his agribusiness management knowledge to
develop a photo novella in Spanish to teach Latino farmers about
the various programs available to help them through the federal
government - typically distrusted by the farmers. His work earned
him the Alumni Vision Award, with what&apos;s believed to be a record
EIGHT nominations from his faculty. Martin is a first-generation
college student and, throughout his academic career, has held a
full-time job to support his family.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Despite growing up surrounded by gangs, drugs and violence in
Southern California, Jose Sanchez was inspired by his mother to
work hard and not let his environment keep him from achieving his
dream. Basketball helped him do that. While majoring in Human
Communication, he was a three-year member of CSUMB&apos;s team and a big
contributor to the Otters&apos; CCAA tournament victory over Division II
national runner-up Cal Poly Pomona. Jose, the first in his family
to finish high school, plans to play basketball in Mexico, and then
wants to work with children and sports.</p>
<p>&#x2022; As the first person in her family to earn a four-year degree,
Lisette Arredondo is receiving her degree in Collaborative Health
and Human Services. She is a role model for her siblings - her
brother is also a CSUMB student - and for young people from her
hometown of Watsonville, where her extensive community service has
done much to improve the quality of life for the residents. She
just completed an internship with the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where she worked on a national
AIDS education campaign targeted at the Spanish-speaking
community.</p>
