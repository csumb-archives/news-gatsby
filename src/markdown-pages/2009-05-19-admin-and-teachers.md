CalStateTEACH based at CSU Monterey Bay, was recently honored by
the Association of California School Administrators.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Flores was named administrator of the year in Region 10,
professor of education. Region 10 covers Monterey, Santa Cruz and
San Benito counties.</p>
<p>According to the committee that selected her, she &quot;provided
dedicated leadership toward upgrading the skills and knowledge of
the teacher candidates in the tri-county area.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Flores has been at CSUMB since 2005. She came from the CSU
office in Long Beach, where she was involved with the program for
five years.</p>
<p>CalStateTEACH is a California State University online teacher
preparation program for those needing to complete a credential.</p>
<p>Using the latest technology, the Internet and print materials,
CalStateTEACH delivers high quality education to people throughout
the state. The program offers an intern option for employed
teachers and a traditional teacher preparation option with no
campus based classes. It integrates educational theory with daily
hands-on classroom teaching.</p>
<p>With participants in schools from here to the Oregon border, the
program now enrolls about 250 students per term in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;In the late 1990s, California had a teacher shortage due to
class size reduction,&quot; Dr. Flores said. &quot;This program was seen as a
vehicle specifically to help rural schools find and retain
teachers. The program has been very successful in alleviating the
statewide shortage and providing highly trained and qualified
people for the classroom.&quot;</p>
