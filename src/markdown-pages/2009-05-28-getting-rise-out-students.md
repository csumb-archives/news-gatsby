on campus.
<p>The mission of RISE is to enhance diversity in the sciences. The
program supports and encourages underrepresented middle and high
school students from Salinas, Seaside, Marina and Monterey to
expand their interest and skills in science while providing them
the tools and inspiration to attend college.</p>
<p>And it works - of the middle school students who started in the
program six years ago, 17 are graduating from high school this
semester. Six plan to attend a CSU or UC campus; 11 are going to a
community college.</p>
<p>Each fall, approximately 40 new students are recruited into the
RISE program from Los Arboles Middle School in Marina and Harden
Middle School in Salinas. The program follows them as they go onto
high school.</p>
<p>Once RISE students finish the eighth grade, they receive a
$1,000 college scholarship certificate. Their scholarship is placed
in an account and held for them until they are enrolled in college.
Once they&apos;re accepted to a four-year university, students receive
their scholarships to put toward their first semester costs. If
they attend a community college, they receive half of their
scholarship.</p>
<p>Middle school students meet with RISE staff members after school
once a week at the school site. These meetings focus on fun,
educational, hands-on science activities as well as homework and
academic tutoring. CSUMB Service Learning students assist RISE
staff members with activities and tutoring.</p>
<p>High school students get more advanced projects, field trips and
career-based curriculum. This curriculum focuses on coastal
ecology, native habitats and physics and engineering activities,
connecting it all to the student&apos;s world and community.</p>
<p>Students also participate in science competitions such as the
San Jose Tech</p>
<p>Museum&apos;s annual &quot;Tech Challenge: Explore the Volcano.&quot; For this
competition, two teams of RISE students designed a flying device to
deliver a payload of simulated scientific devices to a mock-up of a
volcano.</p>
<p>Field trips are a large component of the high school curriculum
where students meet scientists, gain career knowledge and provide
services to their community.</p>
<p>The high school students from the Peninsula meet once per week
at the Seaside Boys and Girls Club; the Salinas students meet at
the Salinas Boys and Girls Club. One meeting each month provides
academic preparation - SAT test-taking skills, filling out college
applications and financial aid forms, etc. The other three weekly
meetings are devoted to science activities.</p>
