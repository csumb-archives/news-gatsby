an offspring hatch, the red-shouldered hawk that has taken up
residence at the Tanimura &amp; Antle library seems to be in good
shape.</img></p>
<p>She and her partner are the proud parents of one chick, and the
mother has gotten a bit protective.</p>
<p>&quot;She&apos;s swooped at someone working up there,&quot; said Mardi
Chalmers, a librarian who has an interest in birds. &quot;Hawks are
aggressive in protecting their territory and their young.&quot;</p>
<p>The birds have built a nest on the east side of the library, at
the third-floor level in an area not accessible to the public.</p>
<p>For a couple of years, &quot;there was a nest in the pine tree
outside the old library building,&quot; Chalmers said. &quot;We think they
moved along with us. They&apos;re very territorial. As the crow - make
that hawk - flies, this library isn&apos;t far from the old one.&quot;</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay construction inspector Jim Conway spotted the
nest around April 20. Then, lead construction manager Ron Deller
noticed debris falling from the building on a windy day.</p>
<p>&quot;I was worried that we were going to have a maintenance problem
every time it was windy. I went up to third floor to investigate,
and saw the nest,&quot; Deller said.</p>
<p>Red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus) are found in eastern North
America and along the coast of California. Adults have a brownish
head and reddish chest; their tail is marked with narrow white
bars. The red &quot;shoulder&quot; is visible when the bird is perched.</p>
<p>They normally live in forested areas. The breeding pair produces
three or four eggs, but typically only one &quot;fledge&quot; survives. The
incubation period is about a month.</p>
<p>The parents take turns minding the chick and finding tasty
treats (such as rodents, bloodied bird pieces or small snakes) to
drop into the baby&apos;s waiting beak. In just a few weeks, the white
fuzz-ball will be as big as the parents.</p>
<p>The campus will have to settle for a view of the nest. The
little one can&apos;t be seen from the ground, and mom and dad are
mostly out of sight, either hunting or feeding the chick.</p>
<p>When the chick learns to fly, the parents will drive it off. But
the chick will probably stay in the area.</p>
<p>Have the hawks been given names?</p>
<p>On that point, Chalmers is emphatic.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&apos;t have names for them; they&apos;re not mascots,&quot; she said.
&quot;They&apos;re wild. We&apos;re admiring them from afar. We&apos;re pleased the
hawks chose the library to build their nest.&quot;</p>
