<h2>Program fuels college dreams<br/></h2>
<p>Heather Barney was definite about her reason for attending
Imagine College.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m here to get that scholarship,&#x201D; said the 11th-grader-to-be
at Seaside High.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay played host to the second annual Imagine
College Summer Scholar Institute in June, bringing more than 150
high school students to campus for a pair of one-week sessions.</p>
<p>The program aims to let students know that college is a
realistic goal for them, and to help them pay for it.</p>
<p>Students from Seaside, Monterey and Marina high schools were
invited to participate. Each student enrolled for a five-day
session and could choose one of three courses to pursue during the
week. Choices included My Global Footprint, about global warming;
My Life Online, an introduction to computer technology (photo
above); and My Understanding of Home, which included storytelling
and art. CSUMB instructors taught the classes; university students
and recent graduates served as teaching assistants and mentors.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the program is the guarantee of a $4,000
scholarship to any student who attends two Imagine College summer
sessions, graduates from Seaside High with a 2.5 grade point
average and gets accepted to a college or university.</p>
<p>A donor and the Monterey Peninsula Foundation are providing the
scholarship money.</p>
<p>Heather chose the storytelling class. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re doing video, audio
and &#x2019;zines. It&#x2019;s about your story and your home,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
teaching me what college is like. It gives us an idea of what
college can give us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I like the food. The food&#x2019;s good.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSUMB, the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center, the
Monterey Peninsula Foundation and the Monterey Peninsula Unified
School District sponsor the program.</p>
