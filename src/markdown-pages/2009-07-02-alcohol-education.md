<h2>University educates students about alcohol<br/></h2>
<p>As the new school year approaches and freshmen-to-be visit
campus for orientation, CSU Monterey Bay is taking steps to reduce
incidents of high-risk drinking and increase alcohol awareness,
especially among students under the legal drinking age of 21.</p>
<p>Gary Rodriguez, prevention specialist with the Personal Growth
and Counseling Center, and Andy Klingelhoefer, judicial affairs
officer, are making presentations at orientation sessions. The
voluntary 30-minute sessions, called Myth Busters, were added to
freshman orientation as a result of an initiative from the
Chancellor&#x2019;s Office.</p>
<p>The goal is to inform and empower freshmen to make good choices
concerning alcohol.</p>
<p>A handful of students showed up at the first session, but the
second session was packed &#x2013; at least 60 students filled the chairs,
sat on the floor and crowded along the back wall of a University
Center conference room.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not here to scare you, to tell you that drinking is bad.
The reality is that you as college students will make choices in
your life,&#x201D; Rodriguez told the students. &#x201C;We want to make sure that
the choices you make are based on facts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Students were handed a quiz containing five statements and were
asked if those statements were myth or fact:<br>
<br>
&#xA0;&#xA0; (1) Beer gets you just as drunk as hard liquor.</br></br></p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (2) If I&#x2019;m 18 and my roommate is 21, it&#x2019;s OK to
have alcohol in my room.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (3) There is a correlation between the amount of
alcohol a college student consumes and his/her academic
performance.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (4) Anyone who passes out from drinking too much
should be put to bed and allowed to sleep it off.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (5) Men and women, when drinking the same amount of
alcohol, will experience the same reactions.</p>
<p>Rodriguez asked them to guess what percentage of CSU Monterey
Bay students drink. The estimates were high&#xA0; &#x2013; one young man
thought 95 percent of students imbibe. The reality is much
different &#x2013; a recent survey of CSUMB students revealed that 43
percent of them chose not to consume alcohol at all, meaning that
only 57 percent drink.</p>
<p>This information is important because studies show that many
college students, particularly freshmen, believe their peers drink
more than they do, which makes them drink even more. But if they
know what their peers actually consume, they&apos;ll follow that social
norm.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Social norms&#x201D; education programs seem to work. A recent study
at the University of Missouri, conducted after it started a social
norms program, found that binge drinking on campus has dropped
nearly 11 percent. Administrators stress that a social-norms
approach doesn&apos;t work in a vacuum &#x2013; it&#x2019;s most successful when
combined with alcohol education and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>The session concluded with a reminder of the services and
resources available through the campus Personal Growth and
Counseling Center. Center staff members also give presentations at
the start of the school year as part of Otter Days, visit First
Year Seminar classes, and team with other campus offices such as
Residential Life, Student Activities and the university&#x2019;s police
department to hold a variety of programs during National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week in October.</p>
<p><br>
The answers:</br></p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (1) Fact. A 12-oz. beer has as much alcohol as an
ounce of 100-proof liquor or 4 oz. of wine.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (2) Myth. Everyone in the room, suite or apartment
must be 21 for alcohol to be allowed.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (3) Fact. National surveys have shown that about
one-third of college students report missing a test or deadline
because of alcohol. Students who earn A&#x2019;s report having 3.5 drinks
per week, on average. Those who earn D&#x2019;s and F&#x2019;s report consuming
on average more than 10 drinks per week.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (4) Myth. Alcohol poisoning is real; people die
from it. Don&#x2019;t worry about getting your friend in trouble; call
911.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#xA0; (5) Myth. Alcohol affects men and women
differently, even if they weigh the same. If a man and a woman who
are the same size drink at the same rate, the woman&#x2019;s blood alcohol
content will be higher. Of course, blood alcohol content can also
be affected by genetic factors, food intake, medication, age and
hormonal changes.</p>
