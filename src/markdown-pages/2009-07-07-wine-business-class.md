wine-related business?&#xA0; If you do, will customers flock to
it?<br>
<br>
California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s course on The Wine
Business lays the groundwork for a successful start-up &#x2013; from
understanding the structure of a business to marketing, sales and
distribution.<br>
<br>
The class will meet on Thursdays for eight weeks from 7 to 9 p.m.
Sept. 17 through Nov. 5 in the Alumni and Visitors Center on
campus.<br>
<br>
The class is a blend of academic rigor and insight from industry
insiders.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The diversity and expertise of the speakers is a key strength of
the course,&#x201D; said Chris Hasegawa, dean of extended education at
CSUMB. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a way to learn, to make connections and to share
ideas.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The class will be taught by industry experts Phil Woodward,
president of Woodward/Graff Wines and co-founder of Chalone Wine
Group; Julie Rosenau, national sales and marketing manager for
Pessagno Winery; and Rhonda Motil, executive director of the
Monterey County Vintners and Growers Association.<br>
<br>
Guest speakers will enhance the class, sharing their success from
the wine industry and beyond.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The class is an excellent way for someone who is considering
starting his or her own wine business to learn valuable information
from the experts who have successfully done this. Participants will
develop a business plan and receive feedback. There is no other
local venue that offers such useful information in a practical
format,&#x201D; Dr. Hasegawa said.<br>
