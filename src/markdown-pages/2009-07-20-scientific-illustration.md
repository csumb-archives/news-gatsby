<h4>Sketching out a career in science<br>
<em>Illustration program comes to CSUMB</em></br></h4>
<p>A science illustration program now based at UC Santa Cruz
Extension is moving to CSU Monterey Bay in the fall of 2009.<br>
<br>
One of the most prestigious programs of its kind in the nation, it
prepares students who are sought after by scientific institutions
and publications around the world.<br>
<br>
Work by graduates of the program can be found in museums and
science centers that include the Smithsonian Institution, New
York&apos;s American Museum of Natural History and the Los Angeles
Museum of Natural History; in magazines such as National
Geographic, Scientific American and Nature; and institutions such
as the National Zoo, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.<br>
<br>
&quot;We&apos;re delighted the program is coming to CSU Monterey Bay,&quot; said
Dr. Chris Hasegawa, dean of&#xA0; extended education, where the
program will be based. &quot;It&apos;s a good fit for our science and art
programs. We can house the program on campus, and we hope to build
a connection with the curriculum in the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Said Alison Galloway, UC Santa Cruz vice provost for&#xA0; academic
affairs and university extension programs: &quot;We&apos;re gratified that a
quality program with the potential for significant global impact
has found a good home.<br>
<br>
&quot;The science illustration program&apos;s move to CSU Monterey Bay allows
it to continue to utilize the natural resources of the Monterey Bay
region, which forms a large portion of its curriculum,&quot; Dr.
Galloway said. &quot;It also provides the additional benefit of
integrating with the campus offerings in a way not possible on our
campus.&quot;<br>
<br>
The program consists of&#xA0;nine months of classroom and
fieldwork, followed by a three-month internship. It accepts 15
students a year - individuals with a strong science background and
a passion for visual art. It also serves scientists who wish to
acquire the skills to illustrate their research.<br>
<br>
&quot;The program has such a good reputation worldwide that recruiting
students isn&apos;t a problem,&quot; Dr. Hasegawa said. &quot;They recruit
themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
The program director, Ann Caudle, and current staff members Jenny
Keller and Amadeo Bachar will continue with the program when it
moves to CSUMB.<br>
