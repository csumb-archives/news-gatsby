University earns Business Excellence Award<br>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay has earned a Business Excellence Award from the
Monterey Peninsula Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The university was honored in the education category. The awards
are designed to increase awareness of the vital role business plays
on the Central Coast. They recognize those businesses and
organizations that have achieved excellence in their fields.</p>
<p>President Dianne Harrison accepted the award on behalf of the
university at a dinner July 23 attended by more than 350 Chamber
members and guests.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s competition drew more than 70 applicants across 16
categories. Factors that judges considered included the
university&apos;s goals, its service to students, its employee
satisfaction and benefits, its commitment to sustainability, and
its involvement with the Chamber and surrounding communities.</p>
