scene at CSU Monterey Bay Aug. 21 as many of the nearly 1,900
students who live on campus wheeled, carried and dragged their
belongings into the residence halls that will be their home for the
next year.</img></p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the two best days in the year &#x2013; commencement is
the other,&quot; President Dianne Harrison said as she greeted new
students and their parents.</p>
<p>About 100 faculty, staff and students volunteered for the Otter
Welcome Team. They helped direct traffic, answered questions,
carried boxes and gave directions to the new students &#x2013; most of
whom had parents and siblings along to help.</p>
<p>Across the campus quad, the completely renovated Dining Commons
opened for the first time. With the look and feel of a restaurant,
the revamped and upgraded facility is bigger and has a redesigned
serving area with new food stations where diners can watch as their
food is prepared. It incorporates energy efficient design, such as
more windows and skylights for natural lighting.</p>

freshmen and 538 transfer students. Total enrollment is
approximately 4,300; about a third of them come from Monterey,
Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.</img></p>
