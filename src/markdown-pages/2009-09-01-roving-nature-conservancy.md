ROVing the waters to protect our oceans<br>
<p>A CSU Monterey Bay faculty member is joining with the Nature
Conservancy and several other partners on a study to assess the
impact of trawl fishing in Morro Bay, using a remotely operated
vehicle (ROV).</p>
<p>Moving just above the seafloor, the ROV &#x2013; an underwater robot
equipped with cameras &#x2013; gathers video and still photographs of
marine life and habitats, vital data in the fight to save
California&apos;s threatened oceans.</p>
<p>The ROV is tethered to and piloted from a ship. It scans the
ocean floor and transmits data to the ship&apos;s onboard computers,
where it is recorded for analysis by scientists.</p>
<p>Using the ROV, Dr. James Lindholm of CSU Monterey Bay and other
members of the research team &#x2013; the Conservancy, the National Marine
Fisheries Service, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary,
Marine Applied Research and Exploration and fishing partners &#x2013; can
evaluate how the seafloor and the animals that live there recover
after being trawled.</p>
<p>Dr. Lindholm has long been interested in the recovery of the
seafloor and marine life from alteration&#xA0; by human activities,
especially from trawling &#x2013; a method of commercial fishing that
involves pulling a large net through the water behind a boat.</p>
<p>&quot;Trawling impacts the seafloor,&quot; Dr. Lindholm said. &quot;What we
don&apos;t know is how the seafloor recovers following trawling &#x2013; or
different levels of trawling.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the challenges in doing this kind of research is finding
a place that can serve as a control area. &quot;We need a place where
there is trawling, and a comparable place where it isn&apos;t allowed &#x2013;
with the habitat types we want to study,&quot; the CSUMB professor
explained.</p>
<p>As part of a larger project, the Nature Conservancy recently
bought out trawling permits in Morro Bay, effectively making it a
closed area &#x2013; and giving researchers the control site they
need.</p>
<p>Trawling has been a contentious issue, pitting fishermen against
environmentalists.</p>
<p>&quot;We aren&apos;t interested in banning any particular kind of gear,&quot;
Dr. Lindholm said. &quot;Rather, we want to provide the science that
facilitates good decision-making so that the resources on the
seafloor can be managed better, in the interests of fishermen,
conservationists and all the people who eat fish.&quot;</p>
<p>Graduate students at CSUMB and Moss Landing and a handful of
CSUMB undergraduates will also work on the project.</p>
<p>&quot;I love working with the Nature Conservancy,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a
great project for our students to be involved in, for the science
we will produce and for the broader effort of being involved with
supporting the Morro Bay community.&quot;</p>
<p>The five-year study was kicked off recently with a name-the-ROV
contest. The Nature Conservancy invited the public to vote for
their favorite name online. The winning name will be announced on
Sept. 25.</p>
<p>The nominations are:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Beagle - Darwin&apos;s famous ship</p>
<p>&#x2022; Petrale Patrol</p>
<p>&#x2022; Rachel Carson - A legend among environmentalists</p>
<p>&#x2022; Rock Lobster</p>
<p>&#x2022; Nemo</p>
<p>For the record, Dr. Lindholm prefers &quot;Nemo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Operationally, writing a single, short word on data sheets
would be easier.&quot;</p>
