<strong>CSUMB reaches agreement with Marina, FORA on future
growth</strong>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay signed an agreement Sept. 2 with the city of
Marina and the Fort Ord Reuse Authority concerning its growth on
the former Army base.</p>
<p>The document details how issues of transportation, water and
wildlife-habitat mitigation will be handled in the years ahead as
CSU Monterey Bay continues to develop as a comprehensive
university.</p>
<p>&quot;The completion and signing of this agreement is an historic
milestone for all of our organizations and communities,&quot; said CSU
Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison in a prepared statement. &quot;I
appreciate the fact that FORA and Marina officials understand the
importance of CSU Monterey Bay to its region and surrounding
communities.</p>
<p>&quot;The contributions the university has made and will make to this
area are enormously significant - not only to the economic
development of our region but also to the education of its
citizens.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement brings to an end more than 10 years of lawsuits
and negotiations. The first suit was filed in Monterey Superior
Court in 1998. In 2006, the state Supreme Court ruled that CSUMB
must negotiate with local governments over paying its fair share
whenever campus expansion results in the need to upgrade such
things as roads and utilities.</p>
<p>The document clears the way for CSUMB to move ahead with plans
for an Institute for Innovation and Economic Development. The
proposed institute, a 10,000-square-foot building to be located at
the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Divarty Street, will
bring together students, faculty members, business people and
entrepreneurs to provide training for people trying to start new
businesses.</p>
<p>The university and the Monterey County Business Council received
an $180,000 federal planning grant last June. The next stage is
applying for a construction grant from the U.S. Department of
Commerce&apos;s Economic Development Administration.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all making a pact, of sorts, to our communities, and to
their futures,&quot; Dr. Harrison said.</p>
<p>The university&apos;s long-term vision for campus development is
contained in a Master Plan, supported by an environmental impact
report, which was approved in May by the California State
University Board of Trustees. The plan, which extends to 2025,
envisions on-campus enrollment of up to 8,500 students, compared to
about 4,300 today.</p>
