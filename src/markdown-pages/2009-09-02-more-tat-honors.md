More honors for TAT
<p>Students and faculty members in the Teledramatic Arts and
Technology program continue to earn accolades for their work.</p>
<p>At last month&apos;s Carpinteria Valley Arts Center&apos;s first animation
festival, student Andrew Dolan&apos;s entry, &quot;The Green Knight,&quot; won
honorable mention. A student-faculty collaboration, &quot;Olive&apos;s
Backyard Concert,&quot; created by Dolan and faculty member Enid Baxter
Blader, won the Audience Appreciation Award.</p>
<p>TAT student Janaye Brown&apos;s short experimental film, &quot;The
Psychosis Series, Tape No. 1,&quot; has been selected for screening in
New York at the Micro Museum&apos;s International Film Festival. It will
be part of a program entitled &quot;Not Still Art.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown&apos;s film, which was created last spring in an advanced video
class, was shown over the summer at the Carmel Short Cinema event
at the Forest Theater.</p>
