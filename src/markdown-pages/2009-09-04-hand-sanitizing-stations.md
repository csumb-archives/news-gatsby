Campus makes another effort to prevent the flu<br>
<p>In a continued effort to prevent the spread of H1N1 flu, CSU
Monterey Bay has installed a dozen hand-sanitizing stations around
campus. The dispensers are motion-activated, automatically
releasing an alcohol-based antiseptic gel when a user places his
hands underneath one.</p>
<p>The gel doesn&apos;t replace hand-washing, but it is a quick way to
disinfect hands when soap and water are unavailable, according to
Diane Ehlers, CSUMB&apos;s director of environmental protection, health
and safety.</p>
<p>The dispensers are located in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student Services Building</li>
<li>Chapman Science Academic Center</li>
<li>TA Library</li>
<li>Administration Building</li>
<li>Media Learning Complex</li>
<li>Sports Center</li>
<li>University Center</li>
<li>Student Activities Center</li>
<li>World Theater</li>
<li>Alumni and Visitors Center</li>
<li>Music Hall</li>
<li>TAT building</li>
</ul>
<p>Sodexo has installed a hand-sanitizing station at the Dining
Commons. Stations will also be placed in the Otter Express, library
cafe and the Otter Bay Restaurant by the end of next week. Two
extra dispensers are on hand and will be put in place when a crowd
is expected at a certain location, such as the World Theater on the
evening of a performance.</p>
<p>The dispensers are part of CSUMB&apos;s ongoing efforts to combat the
flu. The university has set up a website (<a href="http://csumb.edu/flu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">csumb.edu/flu</a>) with information on how to prevent
and treat the flu; emails with that information have gone out to
everyone on campus; and all rooms in the residence halls have
received informational fliers. Vinyl signs will soon be displayed
in campus restrooms.</p>
<p>The objective is to encourage everyone on campus to wash their
hands frequently, cover their mouths and noses when coughing or
sneezing, and stay home when sick.</p>
