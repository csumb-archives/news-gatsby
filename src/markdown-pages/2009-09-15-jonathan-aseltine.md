CSUMB student selected for internship program
<p>Jonathan Aseltine has been selected to participate in the
Congressional Internship Program.</p>
<p>The program, sponsored by the Panetta Institute for Public
Policy, gives students an opportunity to learn about government by
providing them with a two-and-a-half-month internship in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The 25 program participants represent campuses in the CSU system
as well as Santa Clara University and Dominican University of
California. They were chosen by their campus presidents for their
exemplary academic achievements and their interest in politics and
service.</p>
<p>The program started Sept. 14 with a two-week orientation at the
CSUMB-based Panetta Institute before students travel to Washington,
where they will be assigned to the office of a member of Congress
from California.</p>
<p>The on-campus orientation provides classes on the legislative
and administrative structures of a Congressional office, key
California issues, the House leadership and committee roles, the
budget and appropriations processes and White House relations with
Congress, among other topics.</p>
<p>While in Washington, they will attend regular seminars with
government leaders on aspects of policy including economics, the
environment, foreign affairs and defense resources.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>Aseltine was selected by a campus committee after a &quot;very
intense process,&quot; said Rebecca Nestor, associate director of
student activities and chair of the selection committee.</p>
<p>A senior majoring in Social and Behavioral Sciences, Aseltine
noted in his application essay that he spent nine years as a
military analyst and linguist but realized that his technical
job-related training needed to be supplemented with the broad
knowledge base gained from a university education.</p>
<p>He worked in Bosnia, Germany and Iraq. &quot;Each of these
experiences is part of who I am, but I realize the need for our
nation to conduct informed diplomatic and other civilian action
before the recourse to military solutions. This is the reason I am
pursuing my higher education,&quot; he wrote in his application
essay.</p>
<p>The goal of the Congressional Internship program &quot;. . . is to
provide our young people with the education and inspiration to
become the leaders of tomorrow,&quot; Sylvia Panetta said in a written
statement.</p>
<p>The Panetta Institute covers all costs. Students earn 20
academic credits.</p>
