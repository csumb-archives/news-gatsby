Students learn art of leadership
<p>CSU Monterey Bay will hold its annual Student Leadership
Conference on Saturday in the University Center.</p>
<p>&quot;By teaching students how to think ethically, make good
decisions, be socially and emotionally intelligent, communicate
effectively and manage their time and stress level, they will have
the tools to be leaders,&quot; said Kelly Mailly, coordinator of
leadership development.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB is committed to developing our future leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>The university has held a leadership conference for the last
five years. It took off in 2008, after resources were made
available to hire a staff member who focuses solely on leadership
development. Attendance climbed from 20 two years ago to 140 last
year.</p>
<p>No single training session makes someone a good leader; it&apos;s the
culmination of skills that a person accumulates over time, Mailly
said.<img alt="Andrea Mosby" height="200" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/Andrea%20Mosby.jpg" style="float:right" width="160"/></p>
<p>This year, the conference is attempting to engage students at a
deeper level through its theme, &quot;Leadership in Turbulent
Times.&quot;</p>

<p>Keynote speaker is Corey Ciochetti. An assistant professor of
business ethics and legal studies at the University of Denver,
Ciochetti (pictured at left) encourages students to chase the truly
important things in life such as a solid character, strong personal
relationships and a sense of contentment. These are contrasted to
worldly types of success such as excessive wealth, popularity and
prestige. Audience members will get a sense of what it takes to
develop character, set priorities, and gain a big-picture
perspective.</p>
<p>Speaker Andrea Mosby-Jones (pictured at right) will remind
students of the importance of thoughtful decisions in their lives.
College students are faced with tough choices on a regular basis
and need to learn the confidence to make good decisions that will
lead them on a path to success. She&apos;ll walk them through the
factors they must consider when making important personal choices.
From having determination to taking control of their lives,
students will see how to lead themselves and their organizations to
a successful place.</p>
<p>Jeff Stafford will make a presentation on the skills needed to
handle difficult situations and the emotions that might be attached
to them.</p>
<p>A variety of other workshops will be offered throughout the day.
Cost is $10 for CSUMB students and $15 for other students. To
register, call 582-4625.</p>
