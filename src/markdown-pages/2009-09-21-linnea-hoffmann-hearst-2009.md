<strong>CSUMB student earns Hearst Scholarship</strong>

California State University, Monterey Bay, has won a William
Randolph Hearst/CSU Trustees&apos; Award for Outstanding Achievement.
The award is among the highest forms of recognition for students in
the CSU.</img></p>
<p>The award provides $3,000 scholarships to students based on
academic and personal achievement, financial need and community
service. The winners will be honored Sept. 22 at the CSU
Chancellor&apos;s Office in Long Beach.</p>
<p>A resident of Riverside, Hoffmann is majoring in liberal studies
with a 4.00 grade-point average.</p>
<p>As the daughter and granddaughter of teachers, Hoffmann grew up
with the expectation that she could attend college. But as one of
five children, she knew the financial responsibility would be hers
alone.</p>
<p>Her volunteer work through the campus-based Otter Christian
Fellowship has taken her to soup kitchens and to the fields of the
Salinas Valley, where she gathered produce for the local food bank.
She has also helped run events for children at local churches and
parks.</p>
<p>Hoffmann&apos;s volunteer work in an elementary school classroom and
vacation Bible school programs spurred her passion to teach and
work with special needs children. Following in her parents&apos;
footsteps, she plans to pursue an elementary teaching credential at
CSU Monterey Bay and eventually go into special education.</p>
<p>More than 450,000 students attend the 23 campuses of the CSU
system. This year, 23 of those students were honored with Hearst
scholarships. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an
endowed scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain.&#xA0; In 1999, the foundation partnered with the
CSU Board of Trustees to supplement the endowment with
contributions from CSU Trustees and private donors.</p>
