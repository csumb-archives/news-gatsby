CSUMB ready for challenges ahead

Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison on Sept. 24 presented her
2009 State of the University address, hailing the school&apos;s efforts
to overcome the state budget cuts, and urging her audience to stay
committed to students.</img></p>
<p>&quot;I am here to tell you: California State University, Monterey
Bay remains strong and we are on a steady and positive course in
spite of our issues with the state,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The budget crisis has forced the campus to re-examine its
priorities and look for ways to better partner with other CSU
campuses for greater efficiency, Dr. Harrison said. It is testing
&quot;our ability to be more creative, and more strategic, than ever in
our efforts to raise money through grants, contracts and private
philanthropy.&quot;</p>
<p>No less important, she said, is the &quot;opportunity &#x2013; actually the
<em>obligation &#x2013;</em> we have before us: to educate Californians
and politicians on what is at stake if state funding for higher
education is not fully restored &#x2013; as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison suggested that it was possible to be both realistic
and optimistic at the same time.</p>
<p>She pointed out that while the university needs to pause in its
enrollment growth &#x2013; the number of freshmen admitted next fall will
be lower than this year &#x2013; &quot;we have a thousand freshmen and transfer
students who are thrilled to be here this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the university&apos;s successes over the last year, she pointed
to the improvement in student retention rates, and attributed it to
the experience CSUMB is providing its students - outstanding
faculty, a unique academic model and Student Affairs programs that
resonate with them.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge facing the university is to increase the
number of students who graduate in four or five years.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison also reminded the audience that the next major
classroom building has been delayed, but $40.6 million to construct
the 58,000-square-foot project remains in the CSU capital-funding
pipeline. In the not-too-distant future, it will house the School
of Business and the School of Information Technology and
Communications Design.</p>
<p>Another bit of good news: The CSU Board of Trustees unanimously
approved the campus Master Plan and Environmental Impact Report in
May. And the recent landmark agreement with the city of Marina and
the Fort Ord Reuse Authority has cleared the way for continued
development of the campus through 2025.</p>
<p>&quot;It means that once we get the funding, we&apos;re ready to move
ahead with Academic II. And it means we can move forward with the
Institute for Innovation and Economic Development,&quot; in partnership
with the Monterey County Business Council.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison concluded by asking the campus community to
&quot;continue to work every day to make CSU Monterey Bay not just a
solid citizen of the CSU but one of the most remarkable centers of
higher education in the entire country.</p>
<p>&quot;We can do that if we try. And our state will be a better place
for it.&quot;</p>
