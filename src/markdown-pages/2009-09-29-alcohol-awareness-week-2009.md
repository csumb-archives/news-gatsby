<strong>Alcohol Awareness Week at CSUMB</strong>

University, Monterey Bay will join with their peers on more than
1,000 campuses across the country to promote National Collegiate
Alcohol Awareness Week (NCAAW).&#xA0;</p>

have the opportunity to participate in a variety of events, all
designed to reinforce personal responsibility and respect for state
laws and campus policies when it comes to the consumption of
alcohol beverages. This year&apos;s activities include:</img></p>
&#x2022; &quot;The Dope Show&quot; with local speaker Alan Sherer, a licensed
clinical social worker
<p>&#x2022; Fireside chats with representatives of the CSUMB Personal
Growth and Counseling Center, University Police Department,
Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon</p>
<p>&#x2022; The third annual Crash Festival, with a DUI-aftermath vehicle
display</p>
<p>&#x2022; &quot;Olympics Under the Influence&quot; (O.U.I.) where students will
have the opportunity to navigate through a challenging obstacle
course while wearing goggles that will allow them to safely feel
the physical effects of alcohol by impairing their reactions and
judgment</p>
<p>&#x2022; Jell-O Wrestling: an alcohol-free event</p>
<p>NCAAW has grown to become the largest single event in all of
academia, giving campuses the opportunity to showcase healthy
lifestyles free from the abuse or illegal use of alcohol and to
combat stereotypes associated with college drinking behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;NCAAW remains a cornerstone in campus alcohol abuse prevention
efforts,&quot; said Drew Hunter, president and CEO of The BACCHUS
Network, a national nonprofit organization that supports student
health and safety through peer education.</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, campuses need to educate students about excessive
drinking and consequences that can occur on both a personal and
academic level,&quot; Hunter said. &quot;Participation in NCAAW helps
students and college administrators work together to increase
awareness and strengthen year-round prevention efforts. We have to
engage and empower students to take care of themselves and each
other.&quot;</p>
<p>This year&apos;s theme is &quot;iChoose,&quot; developed by The BACCHUS
Network. It contains a message of student empowerment to make safe
choices, to take care of friends, to keep safe by not drinking to
excess, to secure a safe and sober ride home, to avoid driving
after drinking, and never to ride with a driver who has been
drinking. The iChoose campaign messages support personal
responsibility and provide practical safety tips by reminding
students that the decision to stay safe is ultimately up to
them.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, NCAAW is a collaborative effort of the Personal Growth
and Counseling Center, Student Housing and Residential Life, the
Residential Housing Association, Student Activities, the Office of
Judicial Affairs and Community Standards, University Police
Department, athletics, Academic and Centralized Scheduling,
Academic Affairs, dining services, Sigma Theta Psi sorority and the
Monterey County chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon.</p>
