<strong>CSUMB pledges to be carbon neutral by 2030</strong>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s Climate Action Plan aims to cut the
university&apos;s net carbon emission to zero by 2030. Phase 1 of the
plan was released on Sept. 15.</p>
<p>It fulfills the American College and University Presidents&apos;
Climate Commitment that CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison
signed in 2007, and pledges the university to a path of climate
neutrality.</p>
<p>The plan includes specific actions across nine focus areas -
energy; solid waste; green building; transportation; food service;
purchasing; water; CSUMB and California State University planning
policies and directives; and education and outreach.</p>
<p>&quot;Global warming is a defining challenge of our time,&quot; Dr.
Harrison said.</p>
<p>&quot;Human activities are responsible for the problem, and working
together humans have the capacity to solve the problem,&quot; she said.
&quot;That means taking serious action to stop adding global warming
pollution to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;CSUMB is committed to leading the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The plan, developed by faculty, staff and students, will act as
a road map for future university decisions. The campus has set
goals to save as much energy as possible, generate energy from
renewable sources and explore carbon offsets as a last resort.</p>
<p>Phase II of the plan will include goals, implementation
strategies, financial feasibility and how to track progress. It
will be competed by March 2010.</p>
<p>Phase I of the plan noted:</p>
<p>&#x2022; A decline in energy use from 2005 to 2009 due to efficiency
upgrades, even though the university&apos;s overall square footage
increased. Projects have focused on heating, ventilation and
lighting. Some of these projects have been recognized as best
practices within the CSU system and have received awards from
outside organizations. Energy management is an ongoing program at
CSUMB, with dedicated resources.</p>
<p>&#x2022; About 3,000 tons of waste was recycled in 2008 and nearly
3,700 tons sent to the landfill.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library is undergoing
review by the U.S. Green Building Council for a LEED Silver rating;
the university is also seeking a LEED Silver rating for the
renovated Dining Commons.</p>
<p>&#x2022;&#xA0; CSUMB is in the early stages of devising a plan to
reduce single-occupant vehicle trips.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Cleaning products used on campus are Green Seal Certified.</p>
<p>&#x2022; East Campus housing units and new buildings are being metered
in an effort to reduce water usage.</p>
<p>&#x2022; New campus development is taking place within a centralized
core connected by bike and pedestrian pathways within a 10-minute
walk. Approximately 25 percent of the campus has been designated as
native oak open space, and new development is taking place in
already-developed areas.</p>
<p>&#x2022; More than 15 academic courses teach some aspect of
sustainability. Student capstone research has covered topics such
as biodiesel, wind and solar energy; water collection, storage and
reuse; composting; fog collection; and recycling.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the university intents to continue
monitoring energy use, improve campus recycling, build to LEED
Silver certifiable standards and create more transportation
options.</p>
<p>The American College and University Presidents&apos; Climate
Commitment (ACUPCC), which began in 2007, is a network of <a href="http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/signatories/list" rel="nofollow">650 signatory schools</a> dedicated to making an
environmental impact. The schools commit to becoming climate
neutral and integrating environmental education into their
curricula, and sign a pledge to submit a Climate Action Plan within
two years.</p>
<p>On Sept. 15, 2009, the&#xA0;first deadline for the
organization&apos;s 392 original members, 88 colleges and universities
announced their Climate Action Plans, representing the largest
group to simultaneously commit to concrete activities that address
global warming.</p>
<p>The plans list specific steps schools are taking to reach
climate neutrality by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and operations costs.</p>
<p>Schools are already noticing that in saving energy, they also
are saving significant money, organizers say.</p>
<p>Most schools also are incorporating curriculum changes to
prepare students to meet the massive challenge of climate issues
upon graduation.</p>
<p>The Climate Action Plans submitted also show that universities
are making a significant shift toward using renewable energy
sources.</p>
<p>The vast majority of schools submitting Climate Action Plans
have already submitted their greenhouse gas inventories, the first
step to determining and reducing their carbon footprint. CSUMB
submitted its greenhouse gas inventory on Sept. 15, 2008. It can be
