<strong>Prospective students urged to apply early</strong>
<p>Priority admissions for 2010-11 opens Thursday, Oct. 1, at
California State University, Monterey Bay, and officials are
encouraging students to apply early because state budget cuts mean
fewer will be admitted.<br>
<br>
Those who apply during the priority period, which ends Nov. 30,
have a better chance of being admitted in fall 2010, provided they
qualify and complete all requirements.<br>
<br>
State budget cuts have caused all California State University
campuses to decrease enrollment during the next two years. &quot;CSU
Monterey Bay expects to cut enrollment by 10 percent,&quot; said Dr.
Ronnie Higgs, associate vice president for enrollment services.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&quot;All prospective students should apply early as admissions to
the university will be based on a first-come, first-served basis,&quot;
Dr. Higgs said. &quot;CSUMB will most likely reach its maximum allotted
number much earlier than Nov. 30. At that point, all other
applicants will be put on a wait list.&quot;<br>

information is available by calling the Office of Admissions at
