<strong>MST project borders campus on Inter-Garrison
Road</strong>&#xA0;
<p>A sign went up on the north side of Inter-Garrison Road between
Central Campus and East Campus housing last month, announcing that
the area will become the home of Monterey-Salinas Transit.</p>
<p>The transit agency has acquired about 24 acres of a 58-acre
parcel owned by Monterey County.</p>
<p><img alt="MST facility on Inter-Garrison Road" height="200" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/MST.jpg" style="float:left" width="300">The county Redevelopment Agency
plans to subdivide the remaining 34 acres for sale to approximately
a dozen developers in 1.5- to 2.5-acre parcels. That area is known
as the Whispering Oaks Business Park and is designated for light
industrial use in the Fort Ord master plan.</img></p>
<p>MST will relocate its headquarters, storage and maintenance
operations to the property, and hopes to break ground on the first
of three buildings next summer, according to Hunter Harvath, MST&apos;s
assistant general manager.</p>
<p>The headquarters &#x2013; what Harvath calls the &quot;signature&quot; building &#x2013;
will be constructed to LEED Silver standards. The three-story
building will have a sunken entrance. Entry will be on the
second-floor level to minimize what is visible from Inter-Garrison
Road.</p>
<p>A 100-foot-wide buffer of native oak trees will remain on the
property between Inter-Garrison Road and the development. The
entire property will be heavily landscaped.&#xA0;</p>
<p>It will also be enclosed by a decorative fence &#x2013; as required by
the Department of Homeland Security &#x2013; much like the fence that
surrounds the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.</p>
<p>A maintenance facility and a fuel building will complete the
project, along with paved parking for 280 buses.</p>
<p>Harvath emphasized the environmentally friendly aspects of the
project. Recycled water will be used to wash the buses, then that
water will be used for landscaping. Photovoltaic cells will be
placed on the roof of the maintenance building and will provide
enough energy to power the operation.</p>
<p>Buses will enter and leave the yard via the Eighth Avenue cutoff
to Imjin Parkway. Eventually, they will also go through the East
Garrison development.&#xA0;</p>
<p>MST is working with CSUMB&apos;s Planning and Development staff on
issues such as storm water runoff.</p>
<p>Nick Nichols of the county Redevelopment Agency says the
implementation of the light industrial park is dependent on
economic forces over the next several years.</p>
