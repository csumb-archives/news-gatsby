<p>The Greater Vision series of public forums on topics relevant to

professionals, educators and elected officials meet at California
State University, Monterey Bay to discuss &quot;Ag Sustainability: Our
People . . . Transforming Lives.&quot;</p>

President Dianne Harrison, Salinas Mayor Dennis Donahue, Seaside
