&#xA0; <strong>Big help for small business</strong>
<p>Take heart, budding entrepreneurs: Resources are now available
locally for people hoping to start their own business or improve
their operations.</p>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has recently been
selected to host an innovative program that provides counseling and
training to small businesses or people who are trying to start
them.<br>
<br>
The Small Business Development Center (SBDC) will be located in a
storefront in Gonzales. It serves the area along the Highway 101
corridor from Gilroy to King City and provides critical services to
small business owners, helping them create jobs and solidify the
local economy. Services provided by CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s center
compliment and expand on the services already being provided to
Monterey and Santa Cruz counties&apos; coastal communities by the
Central Coast SBDC hosted by Cabrillo College in Aptos.</br></br></p>
<p>The centers help people develop business plans, secure
financing, set up financial systems, plan for expansion, project
cash flow, determine technology needs and provide a variety of
other services helpful to small businesses. In addition to the free
one-on-one consulting, the centers offer a variety of workshops and
seminars.</p>
<p>The nationwide program of Small Business Development Centers is
funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The centers are
usually located at colleges or universities.&#xA0; CSUMB&apos;s center
comes under the auspices of the regional SBDC office housed at the
University of California Merced. &#xA0;<br>
&quot;We are confident this network will support and promote increased
economic growth in our entire region,&quot; said Dr. Marylou Shockley,
chair of CSUMB&apos;s School of Business. &quot;These centers offer vital
support and training and are a natural addition to our efforts to
help area and regional businesses. The university is
well-positioned to provide leadership to the region&apos;s small
businesses.&quot;</br></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs often find that discussing questions in a
confidential and unbiased setting can help identify and clarify key
decisions. Appointments can be made online at <a href="http://ucmsbdc.ecenterdirect.com/ClientSignUp.asp?CENTER_ID=36" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ucmsbdc.ecenterdirect.com/ClientSignUp.asp?CENTER_ID=36</a>
