Earthquake drill set for Thursday<br>
CSU Monterey Bay will participate in an earthquake drill on
Thursday, Oct. 15 as part of the Great California ShakeOut, a
statewide exercise involving millions of people. The date falls two
days before the 20th anniversary of the Loma Prieta
earthquake.<br>

encouraged to participate.<br>
<br>
At precisely 10:15 on Thursday morning, the university&apos;s outdoor
alert system will broadcast a message to start the drill. An alert
will also go out to everyone registered with the OtterAlert text
message/e-mail service. If you have not yet registered for
OtterAlert, visit the web at <a href="http://csumb.edu/otteralert" rel="nofollow">csumb.edu/otteralert</a> to do so.<br>
<br>
After hearing the broadcast message or receiving the text, everyone
is asked to drop, cover and hold on.<br>
<br>
DROP to the ground (before the earthquake drops you!)<br>
Take COVER by getting under a sturdy desk or table, and<br>
HOLD ON to it until the shaking stops.<br>
<br>
If there isn&apos;t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head
with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. Do
not try to run to another room just to get under a table.<br>
<br>
Why is it important to do a drop, cover and hold on drill? To react
quickly you must practice often. You may only have seconds to
protect yourself in an earthquake, before strong shaking knocks you
down - or drops something on you.<br>
<br>
After about 60 seconds, a second broadcast message and OtterAlert
text will go out, urging people to evacuate the buildings and
report to the designated evacuation area nearby.<br>
<br>
An &quot;all-clear, resume normal operations&quot; message via the outdoor
broadcast system and OtterAlert will let people know when they can
re-enter the buildings.<br>
<br>
The drill should take about 15 minutes.
<p>Along with schools and businesses, organizations such as the U.S
Geological Survey, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and
the American Red Cross will participate to test their emergency
preparedness,</p>
