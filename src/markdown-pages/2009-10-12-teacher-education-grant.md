<strong>CSUMB lands $12.6 million grant</strong> <strong>to boost
teacher quality</strong>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is one of three universities that will share a
$12.6 million grant from the federal government for improvement and
innovation in their teacher education programs.</p>
<p>The Teacher Quality Partnership grant from the U.S. Department
of Education is aimed at improving teachers&apos; skills and training so
that students in rural areas can get a better education. Emphasis
will be placed on math, science and special education, but all
teacher preparation programs will be affected.</p>
<p>These efforts at reforming teacher education are inspired by
changes in medical education that took place a century ago.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at closing the achievement gap for
thousands of children located throughout the nine-county region of
Central California.</p>
<p>&quot;The No. 1 goal is to improve K-12 student achievement,&quot; said
Dr. Mark O&apos;Shea, professor of education at CSUMB and principal
investigator for the project.</p>
<p>The five-year grant will be shared by CSU Bakersfield and
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo and the
offices of education in Tulare and Kern counties. It will target
improving student performance in 16 high-need schools in Monterey,
Kern and Tulare counties. The Monterey County Office of Education
will receive funding to support professional development in local
schools.</p>
<p>In Monterey County, those high-need schools are in the Alisal
Union and Gonzales Unified school districts.</p>
<p>The grant will be used to accomplish four goals that will
enhance the universities&apos; teaching programs. They are:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Reform teacher education by introducing features typically
seen in medical education</p>
<p>&#x2022; Bring teacher education faculty and content experts into K-12
classrooms during clinical training of teacher candidates</p>
<p>&#x2022; Recruit teachers in response to the needs identified by
partner school districts</p>
<p>&#x2022; Help support and develop school leadership</p>
<p>Among other things, the grant money will be used to build an
online network to help new teachers form a collaborative community
where they can share ideas and build on individual experiences.</p>
<p>&quot;Research shows that teacher quality is the most important
factor in improving student achievement,&quot; Dr. O&apos;Shea said. &quot;We need
to improve the way we prepare teachers by examining methods
introduced to medical education almost a century ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Before 1910, most medical schools trained physicians through
lectures and classroom presentations. Educational reformer Abraham
Flexner envisioned today&apos;s medical education system, grounded in
clinical practice and apprenticeship. As a result of his influence,
today&apos;s medical professor is affiliated with a teaching hospital,
practicing medicine within that setting while also teaching. By
contrast, education professors continue to teach in the classroom.
Rarely do they demonstrate their own skills as K-12 teachers.</p>
<p>&quot;Faculty members from CSUMB and the other two universities will
be in K-12 classrooms working to ensure that the university teacher
preparation programs are realistic and effective. Part of our goal
is to strengthen teachers&apos; skills before they even reach the
classroom,&quot; Dr. O&apos;Shea said. He noted that university faculty
members will regularly teach in the subject areas and at the grade
levels for which they prepare teachers.</p>
<p>Work is expected to begin in January.</p>
