Picking up the Trail<br>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay will celebrate
National American Indian Heritage Awareness Month with a screening
of the award-winning documentary &#x201C;Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy&#x201D;
on Nov. 9.</p>
<p>The community is invited to the free screening, which will be
held from 6 to 9 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue.</p>
<p>The film documents the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation
from the southeastern United States to Oklahoma in 1838. More than
16,000 Cherokees were forced to Oklahoma so whites can grab arable
lands and prospect for recently discovered gold in Georgia.</p>

Jackson led to a brutal, cross country trek in which nearly a
quarter of the tribal citizens died from hunger, exposure, disease
and sheer exhaustion,&#x201D; director Chip Richie notes on the film&#x2019;s
website. &#x201C;And these were primarily peaceful farming families who
lived in houses, owned businesses, had their own newspapers and
abided by their own constitution.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Cherokee actor Wes Studi (&#x201C;The Last of the Mohicans&#x201D; and &#x201C;Dances
With Wolves&#x201D;) hosts the film in the Cherokee language (with
subtitles). The rest is in English, with American Indian
descendants James Earl Jones, James Garner and Crystal Gayle
narrating or doing voice-overs.</p>
<p>The movie shows the long period of colonial acculturation, in
which Cherokees sought peace with whites. It explains the split
between Indians who wanted to stay on ancestral lands and others
who hoped to evade white land-grabbers forever by moving.</p>
<p>Steven R. Heape, the film&#x2019;s&#xA0; executive producer and a
citizen of the Cherokee Nation, will be on hand to discuss the film
and answer questions. Also in attendance will be Patti Jo King,
American Indian historian and lecturer at the University of
Oklahoma who was an adviser on the film.</p>
<p>The film captured an impressive array of awards, including Best
Documentary at the 2006 American Indian Film Festival. Tribal
representatives from American Indian Nations of Central California
will be in attendance.</p>

&quot;Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy&#x201D; will remain the definitive film
treatment of the subject for years to come. it is an eloquent
retelling of an important chapter in American history and it
deserves to be viewed widely.&quot;<br>
