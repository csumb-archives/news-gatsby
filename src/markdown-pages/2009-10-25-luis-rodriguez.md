<strong>Turning kids away from &apos;La Vida Loca&apos;</strong>
<p><strong>Poet Luis Rodriguez lectures at CSUMB Nov.
4</strong></p>
<p>Luis Rodriguez spent a good part of his teenage life as a member
of an East Los Angeles gang, and has spent a good part of his adult
life trying to keep other adolescents from following that same
path.</p>
<p>The results have been mixed. Rodriguez&apos;s son, Ramiro, is serving
time in an Illinois prison for a gang-related shooting.</p>

told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. &quot;But some of these kids still
can be reached. We have to keep at it. We have to keep trying.&quot;</img></p>
<p>The best-selling author will speak at California State
University, Monterey Bay at 7 p.m. Nov. 4 in the University Center.
The next night, he&apos;ll take his message to El Sausal Middle School
in Salinas.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is far removed from his violent, drug-clouded
adolescence, which he described in his acclaimed autobiography,
&quot;Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A.&quot; Since the
publication of the book in 1993, he has worked to reverse the
corrosive effect of gangs on communities throughout the United
States.</p>
<p>The book is a graphic testament to the brutality of &quot;la vida
loca&quot; - the crazy life of gangs -&#xA0; and is rife with violence
and drugs. According to the American Library Association, it&apos;s one
of the nation&apos;s 100 most censored books. It also earned a Carl
Sandburg Literary Award and was designated a New York Times Notable
Book.</p>
<p>&quot;Always Running&quot; is a cautionary tale, and in the end it&apos;s a
story of how a few patient adults can help change the life of a
young man who seems destined for prison - or worse.</p>
<p>He also also written several collections of poetry, children&apos;s
books, a novel and a non-fiction book, &quot;Hearts and Hands: Creating
Community in Violent Times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can stop gang violence in this country, but not the way we
are doing it,&quot; Rodriguez recently told the Advocate News in Fort
Bragg. &quot;We cannot arrest our way out of this. We need what I call a
whole community approach.&quot;</p>
<p>He believes communities should fight gangs with art, education
and respect, not just by suppression efforts.</p>
<p>Says Rodriguez: &quot;Art is the heart&apos;s explosion on the world.
There is probably no more powerful force for change in this
uncertain and crisis-ridden world than young people and their art.
It is the consciousness of the world breaking away from the
strangle grip of an archaic social order.&quot;</p>
<p>In reviewing &quot;Hearts and Hands,&quot; the Los Angeles Times Book
Review said, &quot;Rodriguez is a relentless truth-teller, an authentic
visionary, a man of profound compassion . . .&#xA0; he acknowledges
the lessons we can learn from the social sciences, he scrutinizes
what succeeds and what fails in the realm of public policy, but he
never allows us to forget the rescue of young people is also &apos;a
spirital quest.&apos; &quot;</p>
