<strong>More help for small business</strong>
<p><strong><em>CSUMB&apos;s SBDC hosts workshop on access to
capital</em></strong></p>
<p>For small businesses, access to capital is access to
opportunity. According to a July survey by the Federal Reserve, 35
percent of banks have tightened small business lending since the
recession began.</p>
