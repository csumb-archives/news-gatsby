Office of the President, serve as a member of the Senior Leadership
Team and assist the president with external relations.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Hiramoto joined the staff of CSU Monterey Bay in 2008 as
associate director of academic personnel. She came to CSUMB from
the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she was director of
equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for eight
years. Prior to that, she served in a similar capacity at
CSUMB.</p>

Berkeley, and has worked at San Francisco State and Stanford
University, where she served as director of academic service for
the School of Education.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Hiramoto&apos;s experience in higher education, and her history
at CSU Monterey Bay, give me confidence in her ability to continue
building positive relationships both on and off campus,&quot; President
Harrison said in announcing the appointment. &quot;She brings enormous
university experience and competence to this position.&quot;&#xA0;</p>
<p>She replaces John McCutchon, who retired last summer.</p>
