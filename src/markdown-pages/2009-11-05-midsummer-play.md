Classroom becomes stage in &apos;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&apos;
<p>A class meets to read and discuss Shakespeare&apos;s play, &quot;A
Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream.&quot; As the class begins, the students chat
among themselves about the usual things &#x2013; their personal
relationships, school events and such.</p>

The students and professor begin to slip into the play, becoming
the characters and performing their actions as if taken over by the
power of the verse itself.</img></p>
<p>A classroom becomes a forest. Students become lovers, clowns and
supernatural beings. Suddenly, a November evening is transformed
into midsummer and the spectators find themselves in a theatrical
dream.</p>
<p>Thus begins CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s production of the classic play.
Performances will be held at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 5-7 and 12-14 in the
Meeting House, located on the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard
and Divarty Street. Admission is free, but seating is limited.</p>
<p>The student actors are enrolled in a class taught by the play&apos;s
director, Professor Will Shephard.</p>
<p>&quot;In traditional theater, the audience is separate from the
stage,&quot; Shephard said. &quot;I create a space shared by actors and
spectators. The stage is all around the audience - it&apos;s a very
intimate experience,&quot; he told the Monterey Herald.</p>
<p>Shephard calls the performance &quot;environmental theater,&quot; a term
coined by director Richard Schechner to define dynamic interaction
among actors, audience and performance space. Shephard worked under
Schechner&apos;s direction in The Performance Group in New York.</p>
<p>The concept originated with director Constantin Stanislavski at
the Moscow Art Theater&apos;s Second Studio and was incorporated into
the work of director Jerzy Grotowski and the Polish Theatre
Laboratory in the 1960s. Grotowski became Shephard&apos;s mentor when
the two worked together in Poland.</p>
<p>The production will take place in the student&apos;s actual
classroom, which used to a small church. The space lends itself
well to this kind of production because it&apos;s intimate, with space
for about 70 audience members.</p>
<p>&quot;In environmental theater, the actors are very close to the
audience, but they are definitely acting in a play,&quot; Shephard
said.</p>
<p>The actors will wear their own clothes, but will don masks in
character. Shephard is a mask maker. He made the ones used in this
performance more than 20 years ago, repainting each one for
different productions.</p>
<p>According to Shephard, the play is ideal for environmental
theater because of its fantastical nature.</p>
<p>&quot;At one moment we are in the court, the next moment in the depth
of the forest. It&apos;s tremendously funny. All sorts of mischief takes
place. The audience sits in one seat and it transforms to all these
different environments. It starts as a class and comes back to a
class.</p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s the real magic of theater - you&apos;re not sure where you
are. Through the magic of performance and sound and light, it all
comes together in a charming and entertaining way,&quot; he told the
Herald.</p>
