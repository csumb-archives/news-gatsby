poems, interviews and essays that confront some of the most
pressing social issues of our day. Designed to inspire and inform,
the book embodies the concepts of &quot;breaking silence,&quot; &quot;bearing
witness,&quot; resistance and resilience. It will appeal to all readers
with a commitment to social justice.</img></p>

Adler, co-editors of the anthology, will be on hand. Adler, a poet,
is founder of the Creative Writing and Social Action Program at
CSUMB, and is the author of five books including &quot;The Making of a
Matriot.&quot; Busman, a fiction writer, is a long-time activist.

Project.</p>
<p>They will be joined by Lorna Dee Cervantes, Elliot Roberts and

<p>The anthology marks the emergence of social action writing as a
distinct field within creative writing and literature. It includes
never-before-published pieces as well as reprinted material.</p>
