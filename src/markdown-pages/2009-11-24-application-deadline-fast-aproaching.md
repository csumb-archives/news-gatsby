<strong>Application deadline fast approaching</strong>
<p>A Nov. 30 application deadline for students seeking admission to
California State University, Monterey Bay for the fall 2010
semester is fast approaching.</p>
<p><img alt="application form" height="92" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/apps%20image.jpeg" style="float:left" width="124">Since the application period
opened Oct. 1, CSU Monterey Bay has received about 8,000
applications for next fall. Up to another 1,000 are expected by
next Monday&apos;s deadline, said Ronnie Higgs, associate vice president
for enrollment services.</img></p>
<p>&quot;This is the last week that we&apos;ll be receiving applications, and
those who have not applied need to get their applications in now,&quot;
Higgs said.</p>
<p>Any applicant who receives a question about some aspect of his
or her application should reply as quickly as possible to avoid
disqualification, he said.</p>
<p>The university plans to send out notifications of admission in
mid-December.</p>
<p>No applications are being accepted for the spring 2010 semester
because of state budget cuts, and a lack of funding is also
limiting how many students CSU Monterey Bay can accept for next
fall.</p>
<p>High school seniors can visit <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu" title="www.csumentor.edu">www.csumentor.edu</a> to submit
applications. More information is available by calling the CSUMB
Office of Admissions at 831-582-3738.</p>
