decade</img></strong>
<p>Since 2000, CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s Camp SEA Lab has helped
youngsters discover the ocean through summer camps and outdoor
school programs. Students get their hands wet through kayaking,
snorkeling, and surfing, while their minds get engaged through
active science lessons and ocean conservation projects.&#xA0;</p>
<p>In its 10-year history, the program has ignited thousands of
K-12 students&apos; interest and excitement in marine science.&#xA0;</p>
<p>For some, the experience has been transforming.</p>

I attended Camp SEA Lab and I absolutely loved it! I&apos;m majoring in
biology right now, and I&apos;m planning on going on to graduate school
to get my master&apos;s in marine biology,&quot; said Rebecca Summers, former
SEA Lab camper and a student at Seattle Pacific University.</img></p>
<p>This summer, the <strong>S</strong>cience,
<strong>E</strong>ducation and <strong>A</strong>dventure continue
with a variety of day camps and residential camps around the
Monterey Bay area, including several programs especially for teens
13 to 16 years old.</p>

to higher education, and, unlike other marine science-based
activities, the program promotes ocean careers through exposure to
marine technology and research and marine science
professionals.&#xA0;</img></p>
