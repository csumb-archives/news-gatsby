<p>This year marks Augie Johnston&#x2019;s second year playing
professional basketball in Germany.</p>
<p>Johnston, a former Cal State Monterey Bay basketball player and
two-year starter for the Otters,&#xA0;graduated from CSUMB in 2009
with a degree in business. Last season he played for Germany&#x2019;s
Velbert Baskets, a team in the northwestern part of Germany. This
year he&#x2019;s stepping up his game and has signed with Germany&#x2019;s
Rattlesdorf Independents, a league one level higher than the
Baskets located in the southwestern region.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Unless you are a high-profile Division I player, you are going to
have to start at a low-level team and prove yourself,&#x201D; Johnston
said. &#x201C;So I am very happy I was able to do that, and I hope I can
move up once again after this season.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
This can-do attitude is classic Johnston. While at CSUMB, the
Atascadero native showed exemplary leadership ability as the
assistant coach during the 2008-09 season, mentoring and supporting
his team as they reached the CCAA tournament.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;You really have to dedicate yourself to whatever dream you have,&#x201D;
he said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Johnson hopes to coach basketball at the junior college level
once he returns from Germany. &#x201C;People who know me know that I was
on a mission to make this happen from day one,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and I
never took a day off.&#x201D;</p>
