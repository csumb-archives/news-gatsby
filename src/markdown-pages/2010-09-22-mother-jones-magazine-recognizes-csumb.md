It&apos;s college rankings season, and California State University,
Monterey Bay has captured the attention of Mother Jones magazine.
<p>MJ, one of the country&apos;s oldest investigative magazines, has
included CSU Monterey Bay in its first Mini College Guide - a list
of 10 diverse schools that &quot;will blow your mind, not your budget,&quot;
according to its Aug. 20 edition.</p>
<p>While the magazine admits that its listing is unscientific, it
includes schools that have &quot;good values and good value.&quot; Among them
are public and private colleges and universities, religious and
secular schools and urban and rural campuses.</p>
<p>It points out that $39,000 is the going rate for tuition at the
liberal arts schools that top the list in U.S. News &amp; World
Report&apos;s annual college rankings. The 10 schools on MJ&apos;s list &quot;have
plenty to offer,&quot; and for a lot less money. Fees at CSUMB are
approximately $4,500 for the 2009-10 academic year.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The magazine also notes that the Monterey Bay serves as a
classroom for CSUMB&apos;s popular Environmental Science, Technology and
Policy major.</p>
