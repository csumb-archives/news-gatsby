<p>When students move into the residence halls later this month,
they&apos;ll find something new in their rooms &#x2013; bright blue recycling
bins.<br>
<br>
CSU Monterey Bay used money provided by a grant from the California
Department of Conservation to buy 3,100 bins. The grants are
intended to promote recycling and are financed with unclaimed
refunds on beverage containers. None of the money comes from the
state&apos;s general fund.</br></br></p>

and Event Services (including Julio Arambula, pictured at left) and
Campus Planning and Development sorted, labeled and delivered 900
of the bins to the residence halls. Each room got one; the
six-person suites in the North Quad buildings received two. Some of
the bins may find their way to apartments in East Campus, according
to campus planner Anya Spear.</img></p>
<p>The goal is to get young people, living on their own, to pay
attention to where they throw their trash. Each bin comes with a
guide that explains what kinds of materials to recycle &#x2013; bottles,
cans, plastic, cardboard and paper &#x2013; and a reminder to carry the
full bins to the new 6-yard blue recycling dumpsters that will be
installed next to each 4-yard green waste dumpster already located
near the residence halls.<br>
<br>
&apos;&apos;We have, in the United States, been establishing a recycling
infrastructure for three decades, but when we look at rates, we are
not improving,&apos;&apos; Kate M. Krebs, executive director of the
non-profit National Recycling Coalition, told The New York
Times.<br>
<br>
National data shows that recycling overall is flat, but it is
especially poor among college-age people, even though they grew up
with recycling as a widespread practice. &apos;&apos;When you look at
demographics, the 18- to 24-year-old sector makes little effort to
recycle,&apos;&apos; Krebs said.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Last May, Spear, campus facilities director Bob Brown, their
staff and representatives from Waste Management, the university&apos;s
garbage collector, conducted a &quot;trash audit&quot; of dumpsters located
near all 11 residence halls. At the company&apos;s Castroville facility,
they sorted through a sample of 1.26 of the 5 tons of garbage. They
found that nearly 16 percent of the material (by weight) was
recyclable. Plastic, aluminum, tin, paper, cardboard and glass had
been tossed in the dumpsters instead of being recycled.<br>

in the rooms, we&apos;ll have a better percentage&quot; of discarded items
being recycled, Spear (pictured at left) said. &quot;They know recycling
is the &apos;right&apos; thing to do; we&apos;re trying to make it the &apos;easy&apos;
thing to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another waste audit will be conducted in the next year, to see if
there has been an improvement.</br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>As part of the effort to cut down on what goes into the waste
stream, the university&apos;s custodial contract was recently updated to
include emptying of employees&apos; desk-side recycling bins. The new
custodial provider, GCA Services Group, has extensive experience in
green cleaning techniques and is a member of the U.S. Green
Building Council. CSUMB is exploring green cleaning improvements in
addition to its current practice of using cleaning products
certified by Green Seal, an independent, non-profit
organization.<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Due to the state budget crisis, the recycling grant has been
frozen. When the money is available, the university hopes to use
some of it for a recycling coordinator position that would be
shared with UC Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
CSUMB, along with 21 other communities and dozens of nonprofit and
private-sector organizations, is a member of the Monterey Bay Area
Recycling Partnership, led by Ecology Action.</br></br></br></br></p>
