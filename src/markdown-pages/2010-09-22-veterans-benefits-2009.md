<p>The Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act went into effect
Aug. 1, creating a new GI Bill benefit program designed for those
who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. CSU Monterey Bay is
ready to assist current and new student-veterans in taking
advantage of this program.</p>
<p>During a ceremony at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.,
President Barrack Obama said helping veterans who have served since
the 9/11 attacks with college tuition and housing is more than a
&quot;moral obligation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do it because these men and women must now be prepared to
lead our nation in the peaceful pursuit of economic leadership in
the 21st century,&quot; the president said.</p>
<p>The new Post-9/11 GI Bill is modeled after the highly successful
post-World War II Servicemen&apos;s Readjustment Act, the original GI
Bill, which is credited with making education affordable for eight
million World War II veterans. Three U.S. presidents, three Supreme
Court justices and 14 Nobel Prize winners have benefited from the
GI Bill, President Obama said.</p>
<p>Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki estimated that a
quarter of a million veterans &#x2013; including members of the Reserves
and National Guard &#x2013; will benefit from the newly expanded GI Bill
by 2011.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, the formula to determine a veteran&apos;s
educational benefits is tied to months of active service. Those who
have accumulated 36 months of active duty since Sept. 11, 2001,
receive 100 percent of the new bill&apos;s benefits. The figure drops to
40 percent for those who served just 90 days.</p>
<p>The new bill is designed to replace the Montgomery GI Bill,
which has provided a lower level of education funding for those who
have served in the military since July 1, 1985. That bill, created
during a relatively peaceful period near the end of the Cold War,
seemed adequate at the time it was created.</p>
<p>But since the advent of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans
successfully argued that the Montgomery GI Bill didn&apos;t go far
enough in helping those who routinely put their lives on the line.
The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers significantly better benefits.</p>
<p>The new bill covers the full cost of fees, and includes a
monthly housing allowance based on the location of the college or
university. The allowance for someone attending CSUMB and taking at
least 12 credits is $1,949 per month. The bill also includes a
stipend of up to $1,000 per year for books.</p>
<p>Fees are paid directly to the university, housing and book
benefits directly to the veteran.</p>
<p>CSUMB was already veteran-friendly, thanks to Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger&apos;s Troops to College program, which was announced in
March 2006. Since then, the university has added pages to its
website with information specifically for veterans; has a specially
designated counselor and support team to help veterans make the
transition from active duty service to accomplishing their personal
educational goals; and will establish a Student Veterans
Organization on campus in the fall.</p>
<p>CSUMB has seen an increase in the number of queries and
applications from veterans since the webpage went up and the
veterans&apos; contact was put in place. The number of veterans
contacting the university for pre-admission counseling has
increased, with some of the queries coming from Iraq and
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In the semester just completed, 35 CSUMB students were using
various GI Bill benefits and another 20 were using the GI Bill
Dependents Educational Assistance program as eligible dependents of
veterans. Another 36 students were eligible for the College Fee
Waiver Program for Veterans&apos; Dependents through the California
Department of Veterans Affairs. These students, as family members
of disabled or deceased veterans, receive a waiver of fees.</p>
<p>For fall 2009, 24 students will be using the new program, and
more are expected to sign up in the months to come.</p>
