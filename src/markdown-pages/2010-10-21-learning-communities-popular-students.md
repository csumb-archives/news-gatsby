<p>In an effort to maximize the education students receive outside
the classroom, CSUMB now offers residents the opportunity to live
in &#x201C;themed&#x201D; learning communities.</p>
<p>Students can choose to live on residence hall floors set aside
for those interested in science and math, outdoor adventure,
liberal studies or business. While no academic content is tied to
the living arrangement, leisure-time activities are scheduled
around the topics.</p>
<p>Freshmen also have the option of participating in Project Higher
Ground, where they live in residence halls with a group of students
who take at least two courses together.<br>
