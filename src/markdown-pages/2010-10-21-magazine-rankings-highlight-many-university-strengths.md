<p>Cal State Monterey Bay is one of the most racially diverse
schools in its category, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report
in the 2011 edition of America&#x2019;s Best Colleges.</p>
<p>CSUMB is tied with Amherst College at No. 11 on the magazine&#x2019;s
&#x201C;diversity index&#x201D; among national liberal arts colleges &#x2013; schools
that award at least half their degrees in the fields of liberal
arts. Approximately 265 colleges and universities are in the
category. The &#x201C;diversity index&#x201D; factors in the total proportion of
minority students and the overall mix of groups. The information is
drawn from each school&#x2019;s 2009-10 student body.</p>
<p>CSUMB also was a leader in the U.S. News category of least debt
owed by students. Members of the class of 2009 who borrowed money
had an average debt of $15,254.</p>
<p>Washington Monthly magazine rated CSUMB highly, as well.</p>
<p>The university ranked second among the nation&#x2019;s public liberal
arts colleges in its contribution to the public good, according to
the magazine&#x2019;s 2010 College Guide.</p>
<p>The Washington Monthly rates schools based on: recruitment and
graduation of low-income students; cutting-edge scholarship and
Ph.D.s; and students who give back to their communities.<br>
