<p>For the third straight year, CSUMB has received a grant from the
outdoor recreation retailer REI for the university&#x2019;s Return of the
Natives project.</p>
<p>The $15,000 grant will support work with school children and
local teachers, university students and community volunteers on
habitat-restoration projects on Fort Ord public lands, the creeks
of Salinas and Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District lands in
Locke-Paddon Park and Marina Dunes Preserve.</p>
<p>Return of the Natives is dedicated to bringing people closer to
nature and nature closer to people through hands-on experience in
restoring habitats. The REI grant is one of many received by CSUMB,
totaling $18.2 million in 2009-10.<br>
