<p>Filmmaker Magazine has honored CSUMB alumni Robert Machoian and
Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck.</p>
<p>The magazine, a quarterly publication and website devoted to
independent film, named the pair to its annual list of &#x201C;25 New
Faces.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The list is the magazine&apos;s &#x201C;bet on the individuals who will be
shaping the independent film world of the future.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Machoian (Class of &apos;07) and Ojeda-Beck (&apos;09) met as
students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, they
had different styles but found a third when working together.</p>
<p>The films they have made together display classic art house film
style, according to the magazine. Visuals are the key, along with
colorful imagery and solitary characters in simple situations, with
editing that tells a story without much dialogue.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, their goal was to make as many films as they could
over the course of a semester, resulting in 14 shorts. &#x201C;Ella and
the Astronaut&#x201D; was shown at festivals all over the world, and
&#x201C;Charlie and the Rabbit&#x201D; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival
last January.</p>
<p>Machoian has become the first TAT alumnus to get a university
teaching job. He has a full-time position this semester at Cal
State Sacramento, replacing a faculty member who is on leave.
Ojeda-Beck is enrolled in the Master of Fine Arts program at UC
Berkeley with a fellowship to help cover the cost.</p>
