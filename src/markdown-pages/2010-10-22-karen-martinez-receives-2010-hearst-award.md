<p>Karen Martinez, a sophomore originally from Oaxaca, Mexico, is
the recipient of the 2010 Hearst/CSU Trustee&#x2019;s Award for
Outstanding Achievement.</p>
<p>Martinez, who in September received a $3,000 scholarship, plans
to become a high school math teacher.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Math was always easy for me. Even in elementary school I would
help the other kids with their homework,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;So, in high
school, I made up my mind to study math.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Martinez, who graduated from Salinas High School, is also a
scholarship recipient through the Pay it Forward Program, through
which she mentors local youth at the Boys and Girls Club in
Salinas. She will be the first in her family to graduate from
college.</p>
