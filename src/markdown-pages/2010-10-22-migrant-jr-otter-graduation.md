heart,&quot; Luis Valdez told a group assembled in the University Center
at CSU Monterey Bay on July 30. &quot;And, above all, the arts are the
key to the future.&quot;</img></p>
<p>Valdez, founder of El Teatro Campesino and an original faculty
member at CSUMB, spoke to an audience of 250 youngsters, their
parents, and educators from the Monterey County Office of Education
and the university.</p>
<p>His remarks were made at the graduation ceremonies of the
Migrant Junior Otters program. A collaboration among CSUMB, county
Office of Education and El Teatro Campesino, the program involves
youngsters in grades four through eight from 10 Monterey County
school districts.</p>
<p>During the month of July, the youngsters were brought to campus
each day, where they received instruction in language arts and math
in the morning. Each afternoon, they were involved in theater

dance and art, taught by staff members of El Teatro. The youngsters
were also introduced to college life and learned what it takes to
be a successful student.</img></p>
<p>Carl Del Grande, administrator with the Migrant Education,
Region XVI office and principal of the Junior Otters program,
emphasized its success.</p>
<p>&quot;We can point to scores in language arts that prove this program
works,&quot; he told the audience. Then he reminded the youngsters,
&quot;This is your hometown university.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosa Coronado, MCOE migrant education director, also praised the
program.</p>
<p>&quot;This program was recognized at the 2010 National Migrant
Education Conference. It&apos;s a nationally known collaboration,&quot; she
said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to ensure that our migrant students see themselves
as future college students, and this collaboration makes that
possible.&quot;</p>
