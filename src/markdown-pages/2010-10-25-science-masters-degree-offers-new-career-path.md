<p>Cal State Monterey Bay now offers a Professional Science
Master&#x2019;s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy. The
new program complements the traditional, thesis-based master of
science degree in applied marine and watershed science that has
been offered at CSUMB for five years.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;plus&#x201D; element includes a professional internship and
training in advanced geospatial technologies; professional and
scientific communication; scientific ethics; and environmental
economics and policy analysis.</p>
<p>Students typically do their internships in the second year, or
over the summer between the first and second years of the program.
Some work on campus in the Seafloor Mapping Lab and the Institute
for Applied Marine Ecology. Others work with government agencies
such as NASA and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as with
environmental consulting groups and non-profit agencies.</p>
<p>Sixteen students are enrolled this semester. &#x201C;We capped it at 16
because we wanted to be able to place them in the best
internships,&#x201D; said Dr. Susan Alexander, director of the
program.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Students find this new option appealing because of the ability
to link applied marine and watershed science to professional skills
and jobs,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many of the students we&#x2019;re seeing are returning professionals.
They have several years of work experience and are looking to gain
advanced scientific and technical skills that will help them move
forward in their careers.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Academic research groups, government agencies and non-profits
are likely to employ these graduates, but the program will also
address the needs of regional &#x201C;green&#x201D; business and consulting
firms.</p>
