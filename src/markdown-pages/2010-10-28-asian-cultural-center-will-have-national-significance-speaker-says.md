<p>Dr. Jack Tchen, keynote speaker at the Salinas Chinatown: Once
and Again Symposium on Oct. 15,&#xA0; told the gathering of 200
people at CSU Monterey Bay, &quot;We, too, are in search of
America.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to the subtitle of John Steinbeck&apos;s book,
<em>Travels with Charley</em>. &quot;In some ways,&quot; he said, &quot;the legacy
of Steinbeck&apos;s writing is what keeps us going.&quot;</p>

at New York University and co-founder of New York&apos;s Museum of
Chinese in America, as well as several other museum professionals
and artists were invited to the university to talk about the
Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum, which will be housed
in the former Republic Caf&#xE9; on Soledad Street. They were joined by
university faculty members, students and community members.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Tchen (pictured at right) pointed out that the museum will
be important nationally, because it will share a history that is
often overlooked. Most Asian cultural museums represent the urban
experience. The one in Salinas will cover the rural and
agricultural history of the Chinese, Japanese and Filipino
communities who lived there from the nineteenth century into the
1950s.</p>
<p>Karin Higa, curator of the Japanese American National Museum in
Los Angeles, advised the group to define &quot;community&quot; broadly as it
goes about the work of preparing the museum to open its doors.</p>
<p>Wellington Lee, Wally Ahtye, Alfred Baguio and Larry Hirahara &#x2013;
community members with ties to Chinatown &#xAD;&#x2013; talked about their
experiences.</p>
<p>A plea for community members to share their artifacts and their
memories of Chinatown was made by Dr. Lila Staples, who teaches
museum studies classes at CSUMB. In collaboration with the National
Steinbeck Center, Dr. Staples and her students are assembling the
material that will be displayed in the center.</p>
<p>The last words came from architect Richard Fe Tom, who drew up
the plans for the museum.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys are going to get there. It&apos;s just a matter of time,&quot;
he told the group.</p>
