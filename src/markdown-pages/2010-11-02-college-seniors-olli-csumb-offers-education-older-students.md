<p>After a career in the Army, and a second one spent in the mining
industry in Peru, Dick Guthrie of Pebble Beach was looking for ways
to satisfy his curiosity about, well, almost everything.</p>
<p>He heard about the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute from
someone he knew and discovered that for a $149 annual fee, he could
participate in a variety of programs for a single price.</p>
<p>Guthrie signed up, and is now in his second year.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have a wide range of interests, and OLLI satisfies them,&#x201D; he
said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a great opportunity for everyone in the area.&#x201D; This
year, he&#x2019;s taking writing classes and one in archaeology.</p>
<p class="pullquote"><strong>TO GET INVOLVED:</strong><br>
An annual OLLI membership fee of $149 covers up to six classes.
Become a member by going online at <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/node/9305" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/olli</a>. The site has course and enrollment
information.<br>
Membership includes a university parking pass and discounts to the
World Theater and athletic events, as well as use of athletic
facilities.<br>
Students may also choose to pay a per-class fee. To register by
mail, call the OLLI office at 831-582-5500</br></br></br></p>
<p>Guthrie is one of several hundred people participating in OLLI,
which was established at Cal State Monterey Bay four years ago with
funding from the Bernard Osher Foundation of San Francisco. The
80-year-old Osher is a champion of lifelong learning who backs up
that passion with donations of hundreds of millions of dollars. His
generosity has funded 119 OLLI programs around the country.</p>
<p>The program is intended for people over 50. Classes focus on
personal enrichment and come in a variety of formats: Some are
lectures, others are discussions; still others are hands-on. The
courses require no tests, research papers or grades.</p>
<p>Most classes are held on campus, though a few are held at other
community locations. Topics this semester include gospel choir;
modern spiritual masters and integral philosophy, both taught by
John Provost; weather and hurricanes; a cultural history of jazz;
autumn bird migration; and the California elections, taught by
former State Assemblyman Fred Keeley.</p>
<p>Guthrie and nine others turned out on a Thursday morning in
September to resume the OLLI Writers&#x2019; Circle. All of them are
continuing students. They range from beginning writers to published
professionals. They&#x2019;re working on all kinds of projects and all
receive constructive feedback on their work. Guthrie is writing a
memoir about his experience as a company commander in Vietnam. And
he&#x2019;s serious about it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I won&#x2019;t rest until I&#x2019;ve told about the soldiers&#x2019; bravery and
sacrifice under trying conditions,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The OLLI writing
courses have helped me stay focused and productive.&#x201D;</p>
