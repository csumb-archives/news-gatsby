<p>A seven-year stint in the U.S. Coast Guard offered Bridget
Hoover many exciting experiences. It was also a time when she saw
the water quality of the ocean at its worst.</p>
<p>After responding to many oil spills off the Eastern Seaboard and
the Northwest, this 1999 CSUMB graduate knew she had the potential
to do something more.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It became very disheartening, and I wanted a job that was more
proactive and preventative in nature. So that is how I directed my
education,&#x201D; said Hoover, who received a B.S. in Earth Systems
Science &amp; Policy.</p>
<p>For her senior capstone project, Hoover measured the water
quality of runoff flowing from the outfalls in Monterey. She
attributes her current career to the ESSP&#x2019;s strong scientific
foundation.</p>
<p>Today, she is director of water quality protection for the
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within the program Hoover
and her staff work with cities to implement storm water management,
assist agricultural industry efforts to reduce runoff into the
ocean, and educate the community about preserving the Earth&#x2019;s most
valuable resource &#x2013; water.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We all contribute to the pollution entering the sanctuary,&#x201D; she
said, &#x201C;and we are all part of the solution.&#x201D;</p>
