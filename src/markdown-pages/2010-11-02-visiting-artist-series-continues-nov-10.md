Art historian Laura Meyer comes to campus on Nov. 10 as the
visiting artist lecture series continues.</br></p>
<p>Dr. Meyer is the author of &#x201C;A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of
the Fresno Feminist Experiment,&#x201D; and organized an exhibition and
symposium on that theme last year at Fresno State University.<br>
<br>
Her work documents the nation&#x2019;s first feminist art education
program, which was established at Fresno State in 1970, and its
enduring legacy in contemporary art. Meeting off campus in a Studio
of Their Own, 15 female students and instructor Judy Chicago helped
pioneer key strategies of the early feminist art movement,
including collaboration, the use of &#x201C;female technologies&#x201D; such as
costume, performance, and video, and early forms of media
critique.</br></br></p>
<p>Many art history textbooks trace the roots of feminist art
education in the U.S. to the program established by Chicago and
Miriam Schapiro at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971,
overlooking its beginnings at Fresno State the previous year.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist
Experiment&#x201D; highlights previously undocumented painting, sculpture,
photography, film, installation, and performance art produced
during the first year of the Fresno experiment, as well as recent
work by program participants. Together, all helped lay the
groundwork for what one critic has called &#x201C;a whole new relationship
between art and society.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Meyer earned an MFA in painting from CSU Los Angeles and a
Ph.D. in art history from UCLA. She is an associate professor of
modern and contemporary art at Fresno State.<br>
<br>
The event, sponsored by the Department of Visual and Public Art,
will start with a reception at 6 p.m., followed by the lecture at
6:30 in the University Center living room. The public is invited.
No reservations are needed for this free event.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
