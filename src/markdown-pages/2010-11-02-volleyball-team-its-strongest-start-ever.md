<p>Cal State Monterey Bay volleyball coach Jody Garry says this
year&#x2019;s squad is &#x201C;not afraid to lose.&#x201D; As the 2010 season continues,
it is very clear they aren&#x2019;t afraid to win, either.</p>
<p>The Otters piled up a 10-2 record by early October, earning a
no. 21 national ranking and demonstrating the chemistry that Garry
strives for.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re playing as a team and not as six individuals on the
court,&#x201D; said junior Rheann Fall, an outside hitter from Elk Grove,
who on Sept. 21 was named NCAA Division II National Player of the
Week by the American Volleyball Coaches Association.</p>
<p>Fall&#x2019;s strong performance in the season&#x2019;s opening weeks was
capped by her school-record 29 kills in the Otters&#x2019; thrilling 3-2
victory over No. 11-ranked UC San Diego. A kill is a spiked shot
that is not returned by the other team, resulting in a point.</p>
<p>Even with the Otters&#x2019; strong start this season, Garry said she&#x2019;s
equally excited about the team&#x2019;s future, thanks to a strong
recruiting effort that brought in four promising freshmen,
including three from the Monterey-San Jose region.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, we&#x2019;re going to do well this year,&#x201D; she said, reflecting
back on last year&#x2019;s 13-19 record. &#x201C;But we&#x2019;re going to get better
and better and better. It&#x2019;s not a quick fix. I&#x2019;m not a quick fix
coach.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Garry credits the success of CSUMB volleyball camps, including
free Youth Otter Clinics this spring for youngsters in eighth grade
and under, paid for with grant funds.</p>
<p>Through the camps, the recruits had a chance to meet her and the
returning players, as well as spend time on campus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They knew me; they knew my program,&#x201D; said Garry, who is now in
her fourth season at CSUMB. &#x201C;They assimilated so well. The key is
to have that relationship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Otters can&#x2019;t match most conference opponents in size or
strength, she said, so they have to be smarter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re not the biggest, they&#x2019;re not the fastest,&#x201D; Garry said.
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re just kids who are willing to put the work in.&#x201D;<br>
