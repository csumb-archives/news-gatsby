<p>Dance is at center stage for the World Theater&#x2019;s 10th
anniversary season.</p>
<p>The Paul Taylor Dance Company returns Nov. 11. Taylor has
choreographed a new dance called &#x201C;Brief Encounters,&#x201D; in celebration
of his 80th birthday. The piece is set to the music of Claude
Debussy&#x2019;s &#x201C;Children&#x2019;s Corner.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Oct. 21, Madrid-based Noche Flamenca made its first visit to
campus, presenting the Spanish folk art form of rapid, fluid guitar
playing, heart-piercing vocals and impassioned dancing.</p>
<p>The fall schedule will close Dec. 11 with a Hawaiian family
holiday performance featuring slack key guitarist George Kahumoku.
Known as Hawaii&#x2019;s Renaissance man, Kahumoku is an accomplished
musician as well as a sculptor, painter, teacher, farmer and
captivating storyteller.</p>
