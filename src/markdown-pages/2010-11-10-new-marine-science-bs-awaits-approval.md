<p>Location, location, location.</p>
<p>The real estate agents&#x2019; mantra may also explain the next
undergraduate major to be added to the curriculum at Cal State
Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>It is location that attracted Elyssa Farmer, a freshman from
Pacifica.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As a 10-year-old, I fell in love with the Monterey Bay Aquarium
and wanted to become a marine biologist just like the ones at the
aquarium,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
When it came time to choose a college, she decided on CSUMB because
&#x201C;it&#x2019;s located next to one of the richest marine regions in the
world. Because of that, I figured it would be sensible to study it
here.&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>As faculty member Bill Head, a professor in the Division of
Science and Environmental Policy, points out, &#x201C;When you think of
Monterey Bay, you think of marine science.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have a more concentrated number of marine science
institutions here than anywhere in the country.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Marine science has been part of the curriculum almost since the
beginning of the university, offered as a concentration called
&#x201C;marine and coastal ecology&#x201D; within the Environmental Science,
Technology and Policy degree program. Courses have been added over
the years, including a scientific diving program that was
introduced last spring. It filled up in a day-and-a-half.</p>
<h5><strong>A new degree is born</strong></h5>
<p>As soon as the approval process is completed, that concentration
&#x2013; which has by far the largest enrollment of the five available in
the ESTP major &#x2013; will be renamed &#x201C;marine science&#x201D; and elevated to a
separate program, leading to a bachelor of science degree.</p>
<p>Elevating the popular program to degree status meets student
demand for a degree with a more recognizable name and serves to
make the program more visible and attractive to prospective
students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our job is to present students with a suite of opportunities,&#x201D;
said Dr. James Lindholm, the Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine
Science and Policy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the Field of Dreams approach &#x2013; create it
and they will come.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And it meets the needs of employers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Employer surveys show a demand for graduates who can address
real-world, interdisciplinary problems and have good technical
skills,&#x201D; said Dr. Marsha Moroh, dean of the College of Science,
Media Arts and Technology.</p>
<p>An important part of the program is the hands-on experience
students get with advanced technologies for collecting, analyzing
and communicating scientific data.</p>
<h5><strong>Hands-on experience</strong></h5>
<p>Students get that hands-on experience in the laboratory and
through fieldwork, often working alongside professors on real-world
research projects. Teaching and mentoring are at the heart of the
experience.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We give students training in geographic information systems
(GIS), remote sensing and seafloor mapping,&#x201D; Dr. Lindholm said.</p>
<p>A prolific researcher, he involves students &#x2013; undergraduates as
well as graduate students in the Coastal and Watershed Science and
Policy program &#x2013; in much of his work.</p>
<p>Since joining the faculty at CSUMB in 2007, Dr. Lindholm has
established the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology. The goal of
the institute is to understand the interaction of marine ecological
systems and human activities.</p>
<p>Among the institute&#x2019;s many projects is one surveying deep-water
habitats in the newly created marine protected areas along
California&#x2019;s north central coast &#xAD;&#x2013; from San Mateo County north to
Mendocino County, using a remotely operated vehicle. The
information gathered will serve as the foundation of a program to
evaluate the status of fish, invertebrates and their seafloor
habitats inside and outside the new MPAs.</p>
<p>Another project involves collecting video and photos that help
to explore, describe and catalogue the resources of the Monterey
Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s also researching the recovery of seafloor habitats off
Morro Bay and the Gulf of Maine following the cessation of
trawling.</p>
<h5><strong>Ten days in an undersea laboratory</strong></h5>
<p>Perhaps the project with the highest visibility is Dr.
Lindholm&#x2019;s work with Aquarius, the world&#x2019;s only underwater
laboratory.</p>
<p>In 2008, he led a mission that studied the movement and behavior
of coral reef fish off Key Largo in the Florida Keys National
Marine Sanctuary. Dr. Lindholm supported the mission from the
surface, but three CSUMB graduate students spent 10 days in the
lab, 60 feet below the sea surface.</p>
<p>He returned in October to lead Aquarius 2010: If Reefs Could
Talk, a mission designed to educate the public so they can make
informed decisions about how their actions impact the world&#x2019;s most
important resource &#x2013; the ocean.</p>
<p>Dr. Lindholm and a graduate student lived in the laboratory,
which he says is similar to the International Space Station in size
and functionality. Two students worked from the surface, and two
more were &#x201C;ambassadors&#x201D; for the program, working with Monterey
County schools that showed live broadcasts from the lab.</p>
<p>Qualifying for the mission isn&apos;t easy. The physical requirements
are similar to what potential astronauts face. All participants
have to be experienced divers with research and rescue
certifications.</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly a remarkable opportunity for these students,&quot; Dr.
Lindholm said. &quot;What they are going to experience is
extraordinary.&quot;</p>
<h5><strong>Students work on seafloor mapping</strong></h5>
<p>Other opportunities &#x2013; and jobs &#x2013; are available to students
through the university&#x2019;s Seafloor Mapping Lab.</p>
<p>Supported through grant and contract work, the Seafloor Mapping
Lab conducts marine habitat survey work from the Arctic to the
Antarctic. The lab has been instrumental in the ongoing California
Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first
comprehensive, high-resolution map of California&apos;s state waters &#x2013;
from the shoreline out three nautical miles.</p>
<p>The project involves industry, resource management agencies and
universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing
the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We know more about the surface of Mars than the three-mile
strip of state waters along our coast,&#x201D; Dr. Kvitek said. &#x201C;If the
goal is to protect and sustainably manage our marine resources, we
don&#x2019;t have the tools to do it without that basic map. You can see
everything down to the size of a lawn chair, and you can look for
changes year after year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Kvitek&#x2019;s work has been featured on the Discovery Channel and
in National Geographic magazine, among other publications.</p>
<p>These opportunities to do hands-on research appeal to
students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I chose CSUMB because the fieldwork with the marine program is
a big part of it, and I like working outside, with people,&#x201D; said
Jazmyn Julius, a freshman from Santa Maria.</p>
<p>Katie Wrubel can tell Jazmyn about that.</p>
<p>Wrubel, a 2010 graduate of the ESTP program, spent the summer
working with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The
10-week program was identified by CSUMB&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Center and sponsored by Oregon State University.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s now pursuing a Ph.D. in environmental science at
Washington State University in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The people I met are the best part,&#x201D; Wrubel told OSU. &#x201C;The
marine science world is so small and it seems that everyone knows
everyone, so joining that circle has opened so many doors for
me.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="intro">AT A GLANCE</p>
<p>Currently, more than half of the 300 Environmental Science,
Technology and Policy majors at Cal State Monterey&#xA0; Bay and
about 30 percent of the 400 biology majors are pursuing
marine-related concentrations.</p>
<p>No other school in the 23-campus California State University
system offers a B.S. in marine science. Pending approval, the
degree is scheduled to be offered at CSUMB in the fall of 2012.</p>
<p>Marine scientists deal with a variety of issues &#xAD;&#x2013; from climate
change, declining fisheries and eroding coastlines to the invention
of new technologies to explore the sea.</p>
<p>According to NOAA, there&#x2019;s a huge potential for growth in the
field as researchers learn more about the ocean and its
interactions with the land and atmosphere, how humans affect the
ocean, and the impact of ocean resources on our quality of
life.</p>
