<p>Generations of California elementary school students have
visited the adobe missions that dot the state from San Diego to
Sonoma. The 21 missions, begun in 1769 by Father Junipero Serra,
had a big impact on Dr. Ruben Mendoza.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My interest in history started on a fourth-grade field trip
from my home in Fresno to Mission San Juan&#xA0;Bautista,&#x201D; Dr.
Mendoza explained. &#x201C;I fell in love with it, but I wanted to know
more.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That school trip ignited a lifelong passion.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendoza went on to earn an undergraduate degree from CSU
Bakersfield and graduate degrees in archaeology at the University
of Arizona. He came to CSU Monterey Bay as a founding faculty
member in 1995.</p>
<p>A chance meeting with the pastor of Mission San Juan Bautista
resulted in an invitation to work there. That was 15 years ago.
Since then, he&#x2019;s worked at many of the California missions, as well
as some in the American Southwest and Mexico. Dr. Mendoza is also a
charter board member of the California Missions Foundation. He&#x2019;s
become the local go-to expert on the subject and one of only a
handful of mission archaeology and conservation specialists in
California.</p>
<p>Students in CSUMB&#x2019;s Division of Social, Behavioral and Global
Studies can pursue a concentration in archaeology. Each year, 15 to
20 students do so, many of them attracted by the prospect of
working with Dr. Mendoza. Some continue on to graduate school.
Public agencies and contractors hire others. Because much of the
California coast is archaeologically sensitive, contractors need
trained people to determine whether an area under construction is
historically significant.</p>
<h5>HANDS-ON LEARNING</h5>
<p>When asked what appeals to students about the subject, Dr.
Mendoza has a ready answer. &#x201C;They see it as sexy, interesting ...
the &#x2018;Indiana Jones&#x2019; mystique. My job is to demystify the field,&#x201D; he
said.<br>
He may &#x201C;demystify&#x201D; it, but he does it in a way that attracts
students.</br></p>
<p>Adrian Lopez, a 2007 graduate of CSUMB, is pursuing a master&#x2019;s
degree in urban and regional planning at San Jos&#xE9; State University,
focusing on historic preservation. That interest is the result of
Lopez&#x2019;s work at the Soledad Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista and
the Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey while enrolled in Dr.
Mendoza&#x2019;s classes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s involved with students in a very direct way,&#x201D; Lopez said.
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s an educator, a motivator and an inspiration. He inspired me
to continue my education.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When they work with him at the missions, students take on
specific community service projects. Some of what they do involves
answering questions from the public, conducting tours and
installing museum exhibits. They also do fieldwork, learning to
identify, catalog and interpret their findings through the science
of archaeology, and they learn about public service.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing better than putting them in the field for
hands-on work,&#x201D; Dr. Mendoza said.</p>
<p>Brenna Wheelis enrolled in his Mission Archaeology class in 2007
to fulfill a Service Learning requirement. &#x201C;I was hooked. I
completed over 160 Service Learning hours that semester,&#x201D; she said,
well beyond what she needed.</p>
<p>Since graduating last spring, Wheelis has been part of the
excavation and recovery of a Native American burial site in Carmel
Valley, and she co-authored a historic structures report on the
1932 Maryknoll Rectory at Mission San Juan Bautista with Dr.
Mendoza. Many of his students are cited in his scholarly
publications for their contributions to the work.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s highly accessible to his students,&#x201D; Wheelis said, &#x201C;and
never discourages their curiosity. He takes a genuine interest in
what his students think ... and creates a curriculum that develops
individual scholarship. He&#x2019;s had a tremendous influence on my
decision to apply to graduate school in order to pursue archaeology
as a career.&#x201D;</p>
<h5>&#x2018;COLUMN OF LIGHT&#x2019;</h5>
<p>Digging into the missions&#x2019; past is more than an academic
exercise or teaching tool for Dr. Mendoza. He believes that knowing
what went on there helps us understand who we are today, and how
California became what it is.</p>
<p>Asked to name the most significant work he&#x2019;s done, he didn&#x2019;t
hesitate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Discovering the Serra chapels at the Royal Presidio of
Monterey,&#x201D; he said. He&#x2019;s referring to the discoveries in the summer
of 2008 of the &#x201C;first&#x201D; and &#x201C;second&#x201D; chapels, each consisting of
rectangular adobe buildings located directly in front of the
present San Carlos Cathedral (constructed in 1791-95). The area
marks the spot where, in 1770, Father Junipero Serra celebrated the
earliest Mass in a formally constructed church on the California
coast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the solstice studies are turning out to be a big thing.
It&#x2019;s like a Dan Brown novel,&#x201D; he said, referring to the author of
&#x2018;The Da Vinci Code.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m looking at symbology, iconography and ancient secrets. I&#x2019;ve
got competitors, I&#x2019;ve got collaborators.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Mendoza has documented that 12 missions in California alone
are aligned to mark the winter or summer solstice. The solar
geometry was first brought to his attention on the morning of Dec.
21, 1997, at Mission San Juan Bautista by the pastor, when the
altar was bathed in sunlight, casting what he calls &#x201C;an intense
column of light&#x201D; directly on the tabernacle. He is convinced it&#x2019;s
the result of a deliberate design by the Spanish missionaries who
built the missions.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendoza predicted and documented a similar illumination at
Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Carmel on the summer solstice on
June 21, 2003. He has gone on to document scores of other solstice
and feast day sites in the American Southwest and Mexico and
presented his findings before the Society for American Archaeology
in St. Louis this April.</p>
<p>The public will have an opportunity to learn more about Dr.
Mendoza&#x2019;s work at Mission San Juan Bautista. PBS television plans a
documentary on the archaeology, historiography and conservation
efforts there.</p>
<p>Mission study is an emerging field, he said: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s so much
that&#x2019;s unknown. Many records have not yet been scrutinized. We&#x2019;re
in a post-colonial era. What happened in the colonial era?</p>
<p>&#x201C;No answer you give in this moment will hold in the next moment.
For me, that&#x2019;s exciting,&#x201D; he said.<br>
&#x201C;When I see the fourth-graders at the mission ... I do this for
them.&#x201D;</br></p>
