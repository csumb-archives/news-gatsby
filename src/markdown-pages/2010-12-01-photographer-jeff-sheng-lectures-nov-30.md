<h3><strong>Photographer Jeff Sheng lectures at CSUMB Nov.
30</strong></h3>
<p>The President&#x2019;s Speaker Series resumes Nov. 30 when photographer
Jeff Sheng visits campus. His talk will start at 7 p.m. in the
World Theater.</p>
<p>Sheng, an artist who teaches Asian American studies and
photography at UC Santa Barbara, will talk about his work, which
deals with sexuality and homophobia. He&#x2019;ll also talk about his
experiences as an activist of color.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;ll present &#x201C;Fearless,&#x201D; a series of photos he has worked on
since 2003 that depict lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender high
school and college athletes who are open about their sexuality.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fearless&#x201D; was shown at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver
and, in the last four years, has toured more than 40 colleges and
high schools. It&#x2019;s exhibited mostly in student centers and
gymnasiums &#x2013; high traffic areas that allow a large audience to see
the photos.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;ll also talk about his recent series of photos depicting
closeted members of the military, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Ask, Don&#x2019;t Tell.&#x201D; In 2008,
when &#x201C;Fearless&#x201D; was first featured in the national media, Sheng
received e-mails from service members, saying they had been moved
by the photos. He realized he had found his next project.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Ask, Don&#x2019;t Tell&#x201D; is a series of portraits of gay men and
lesbians, all of them shown in uniform but with their faces
obscured in some way. In one image, an airman sits on a hotel bed,
his hand cupping his face to shield it from the lens. The portrait
conveys a sense of isolation and loneliness. It&#x2019;s the image that
landed on the book cover, and in Time magazine last February.</p>
<p>He traveled around the country to interview and photograph
military personnel. At first, he paid his own expenses; later, he
was helped by a grant.</p>
<p>While the &#x201C;Fearless&#x201D; photos were shot on film, Sheng used a
digital camera for &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Ask, Don&#x2019;t Tell.&#x201D; That way, he could show
his subjects their pictures right away &#x2013; and so, he told the New
York Times, help build their trust.</p>
<p>He describes his subjects, identified only by pseudonyms, as
people who didn&#x2019;t want to risk their careers, but wanted to take
some kind of stand.</p>
<p>The photos have attracted national attention and have been
featured in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, ABC World News,
Time magazine, NPR and the BBC, among other media outlets.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think photographs have the power to move people that
sometimes words don&apos;t,&quot; Sheng says. &quot;And you look at these images
and what you see is that people who are gay look very similar, the
same, as people you would assume to be straight. That&apos;s a powerful
message.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In conjunction with the lecture, &#x201C;Fearless&#x201D; will be exhibited on
campus. From Nov. 8-19, the photos can be seen in the University
Center on Sixth Avenue during normal business hours. From Nov.
22-30, the photos will be displayed in the lobby of the World
Theater. Please call the theater at (831) 582-4580 for exhibit
times.</p>
<p>The lecture and exhibit are free. Reservations for the lecture
are recommended and can be made online at csumb.edu/speakers. For
