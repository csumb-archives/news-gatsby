<p>With thousands of students affected by Hurricane Katrina forced
to improvise on their fall-semester plans, many are inquiring about
taking classes elsewhere. Some of those students will be able to
call California State University, Monterey Bay their new academic
home, if they choose.<br>
<br>
CSU officials said the system stands ready to accommodate
California residents who had planned to attend Gulf Coast schools,
as well as out-of-state students from campuses that lay within
areas affected by the devastating storm.<br>
<br>
&quot;We will do what we can, as fast as we can, to help out these
students and their families,&quot; Cal State Chancellor Charles B. Reed
said in a news release.<br>
<br>
Students from Gulf Coast areas where the hurricane struck will be
exempt from non-resident fees. The standard CSU fees will be
required, but not immediately. The campus will provide deferred
payment plans. Resident fees for the school year are $3,000. Room
and board add approximately $7,000 to the cost.<br>
<br>
Even those without proper academic documentation - transcripts and
placement tests - will be accepted on a conditional basis.<br>
<br>
Since CSUMB has already completed a week of the semester, newly
arriving students will be ushered through the advising and
registration process to get them right into classes.<br>
<br>
&quot;We will assist students on a case-by-case basis,&quot; said Dennis
Geyer, director of Admissions and Records. &quot;We will take
applications over the phone and help these students through every
step of the process.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sept. 19 is the last day to apply. At that point, students would be
coming to campus four weeks into the semester. But, &quot;our faculty
has expressed a willingness to do everything they can to help these
students catch up on the work they will have missed, and to help
them succeed,&quot; said David Anderson, dean of the College of
Professional Studies.<br>
<br>
Approximately 30 two-year and four-year campuses serving an
estimated 150,000 students are located in the affected areas of
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Dozens of colleges around the
country said they would help displaced students find spaces, have
extended deadlines, waived application fees and promised to
streamline paperwork. The federal Education Department also pledged
to relax student-loan guidelines to help transferring
students.<br>
<br>
A phone number -- (831) 582-3580 -- has been set up for students
affected by the hurricane and interested in coming to CSUMB. E-mail
