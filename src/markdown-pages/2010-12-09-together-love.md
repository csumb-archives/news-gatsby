<h4>Student provides design for annual fundraising event</h4>
<p>As publicity kicks in for the annual Together with Love 10K
race, cheerful red images focusing on the word LOVE will pop up
around the local area.</p>
<p>The artwork was done by CSU Monterey Bay student Micah Iriye as
part of a project in Professor Bobbi Long&#x2019;s digital art and design
class.<br>
<br>
This is the first year the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center,
sponsor of the annual race that is held near Valentine&#x2019;s Day, has
worked with CSUMB to develop the art that is used in marketing
materials and on the T-shirt that goes to race participants.<br>
<br>
Students in Professor Long&#x2019;s foundation-level design class get
experience working on a &#x201C;real&#x201D; project and the MCRCC gets
high-caliber art that helps define its theme.<br>
<br>
MCRCC&#x2019;s previous designer, Gwen Marie, made three visits to the
class to introduce the project and give feedback on the students&#x2019;
work. She selected seven finalists (from the class of 27) to
present to the center&#x2019;s executive director, Clare Mounteer.<br>
<br>
Mounteer showed the designs to the center&#x2019;s board members, who
chose Iriye&#x2019;s work for this year&#x2019;s logo.<br>
<br>
For 25 years, the race has been the biggest annual fundraising
event for the Rape Crisis Center, a nonprofit agency that serves
adults and children who have been sexually abused. It also provides
prevention education programs throughout Monterey County.<br>
<br>
The MCRCC isn&#x2019;t the only community organization to benefit from the
talents of Professor Long&#x2019;s students.<br>
<br>
Members of her Publications Design course have been designing the
poster and marketing materials for First Night Monterey since
2003.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;These projects give students real-world experience of working with
a client and progressing through various stages of the design
process,&#x201D; said Professor Long, who has an undergraduate degree from
the University of Washington and a master&apos;s degree in fine arts
from the Basel College of Design in Switzerland.<br>
<br>
Publication Design is not an art class &quot;where students just have a
muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you have
to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their
ideas, and you interpret that,&quot; she told the Monterey Herald
newspaper in an interview several years ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;This program gives students a chance to show their talents,
skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and
respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a
project.&quot;<br>
