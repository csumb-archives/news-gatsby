<p>Graduates of the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU
Monterey Bay continue to earn recognition and accolades for their
work.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive year, the university will be
represented at the Sundance Film Festival &#x2013; the biggest independent
film gathering in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Prairie Love,&#x201D; produced by 2003 graduate Douglas Mueller, will
have its world premiere in the festival&#x2019;s NEXT competition. Eight
films were selected for their innovative and original work on a
budget of less than $500,000 &#x2013; a pittance in the movie industry.
Although the NEXT category is non-competitive, an audience choice
award is up for grabs.</p>

a record number &#x2013; were submitted to Sundance this year, and just
under 200 were accepted, according to the festival website.</img></p>
<p>Sundance will be held in and around Park City, Utah, Jan. 20-30.
&#x201C;Prairie Love&#x201D; will be screened four times &#x2013; Jan. 23, 25, 27 and 28
&#x2013; and Mueller (pictured at left) plans to be on hand for all of
them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Teledramatic Arts&apos; faculty and staff are ecstatic for
Douglas,&#x201D; said department chair Enid Baxter Blader. &#x201C;He remains a
highly regarded member of our TAT community. This recent
accomplishment is a fantastic recognition of his talent and
vision.&quot;</p>
<p>The film was shot in Minot, N.D., in January 2009. It&#x2019;s a dark
comedy about a nomad traveling the rural roads of North Dakota who
saves the life of a stranded man. When the nomad discovers the man
is headed to visit a pen-pal girlfriend he has never seen, the
nomad assumes his identity in hopes of having a relationship with
her.</p>
<p>The shooting was completed over 23 days, and in sub-zero
weather. &#x201C;On a rare occasion we would do less than 12 hours, and
only because we ran out of daylight,&#x201D; Mueller said. The weather
created problems &#x2013; &#x201C;cameras fail at about 20 below&#x201D; &#x2013; but the
filmmakers didn&#x2019;t let them derail their plans.</p>
<p>As the film&#x2019;s producer, Mueller&#x2019;s work took a variety of
forms.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I focused on the creative end, as opposed to the business or
financial elements,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I gave the director notes on his
script from the start, I worked on storyboards, location scouting,
casting, costumes, coordinating between the departments, along with
making sure whatever we were shooting next was going to be
ready.&#x201D;</p>

that his role included a lot of things that weren&#x2019;t so much fun &#x2013;
cleaning up, shoveling snow, getting cars out of ditches, and
&#x201C;asking for things for free.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>After graduating from Minot High School &#x2013; where he met several
of his colleagues on the film &#x2013; he was determined to go to school
in California. He looked for a small school with a good film
department. CSUMB filled the bill on both counts.</p>
<p>It was a good fit. &#x201C;There was always a faculty or staff member
who was eager to help me with what I needed and ultimately, I
walked away with more experience producing and directing than my
friends did at New York University,&#x201D; Mueller said.</p>
<p>He believes that the university gave him a &#x201C;great&#x201D; education,
&#x201C;not only about film, but many things. My classes and my peers
helped me look at social issues in a way I never had. . . .&#x201D;</p>
<p>When he completed his degree in 2003, he stayed in the area. A
year later, he joined the Carmel Bach Festival as production
manager, a job he still has. His work with the festival inspired
him to make &#x201C;Intermezzo No. 1,&#x201D; a short documentary about the
festival&apos;s keyboard tuner that premiered at the Nashville Film
Festival this year and will screen at the Ozark Foothills Festival
in 2011.</p>
<p>&quot;Doug is one of the students who really kept the dream of making
movies,&#x201D; said TAT instructor Steven Levinson. &#x201C;He was always a
great writer and producer. Once he got into the real world, he
seriously applied the &#x2018;real world&#x2019; training he got here at
CSUMB.&quot;</p>

<p>Last year&#x2019;s Sundance festival saw the premiere of &#x201C;Charlie and
the Rabbit&#x201D; by TAT alums Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck.
&#x201C;Charlie&#x201D; and their previous film, &#x201C;Ella and the Astronaut,&#x201D; were
shown at film festivals around the world.</p>
<p>They were named to Filmmaker Magazine&#x2019;s list of &#x201C;25 New Faces&#x201D;
for 2010, a list recognizing the top up-and-coming talent in the
independent film industry.</p>
