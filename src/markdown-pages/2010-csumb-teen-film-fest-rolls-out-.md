<p>More than 150 films have been submitted to California State University, Monterey Bay's first Teen Film Festival, which takes place today at 1 p.m. in the World Theater. Doors open at 12:30 p.m. Since last fall, students from 13 to 19 years old have been encouraged to submit their five-minute videos and films. Submissions have come from around the state - from Marin County to San Diego - but most were local, said Enid Baxter Blader, professor of film and video at CSUMB. â€“ Monterey Herald, April 19, 2009
