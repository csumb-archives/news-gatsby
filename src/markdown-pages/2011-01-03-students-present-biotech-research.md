<h3>Student-industry networking on the agenda at annual
conference</h3>
<p>Students and faculty from CSU Monterey Bay will join colleagues
from other California State University campuses to present research
on genes, proteins, cancers, crops, water quality and other topics
at the 23rd annual CSU Biotechnology Symposium Jan. 7 and 8 at the
Hyatt Regency Orange County.<br>
<br>
Six CSUMB students &#x2013; four undergraduates and two master&#x2019;s degree
students &#x2013; will present their work. Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan, who
teaches cell and molecular biology, is one of the organizers of the
event and helped to select one of this year&#x2019;s award winners.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&#x2019;s Erin Stanfield is a finalist for the annual Eden Graduate
Student Research Award, worth $1,750 to cover educational and
travel-related expenses. Stanfield&#x2019;s research uses molecular
methods to tackle a problem in the Monterey Bay area &#x2013; the presence
of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria in local lakes. She
worked for more than a year at Pinto Lake in Watsonville; her work
will help inform water management agencies around the area and
garner new information about how these complex organisms sense
their environment and produce toxins.<br>
<br>
Undergraduates Jen Cleveland, Kevin Johnson, Mark Callaghan and
Pierre Boivin and grad student Maren Mitch are also presenting
their work at the two-day conference.<br>
<br>
With roughly 500 CSU students and faculty joining nearly 100
industry professionals, community college representatives and
elected officials, the symposium is the major annual event
dedicated to developing biotechnology researchers in
California.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The symposium will also feature expert panels of scientists,
engineers and journalists addressing healthcare solutions for the
developing world, public understanding of human DNA analysis, and
the commercialization of life-science innovations. CSU scholars
will also discuss innovative research on using databases to
discover new drugs, biogeochemistry and cellular physiology, and
insulin production in pancreatic cells.</p>
<p>Networking sessions for students and workshops for faculty are
also on the agenda.</p>
<p>It is sponsored by the CSU Program for Education and Research in
Biotechnology (CSUPERB),<br>
which serves as the CSU&#x2019;s primary liaison to industry and academic
partners in the realm.</br></p>
<p>According to CSU Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic
Officer Ephraim P. Smith, &#x201C;Each year, the CSU Biotechnology
Symposium showcases the research of hundreds of students working
toward high-demand science, technology, engineering and math
degrees. Biotechnology and other knowledge-based industries
represent the future of California&apos;s economic growth. CSUPERB&apos;s
symposium helps to advance well-educated individuals who are
critical to this workforce.&#x201D;</p>
<p>CSUPERB Executive Director Susan Baxter said the interface with
industry speakers and expert panelists allows faculty-student teams
to &#x201C;stay connected to the grand challenges.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Baxter: &#x201C;They can see how discoveries they&#x2019;ve made in the
laboratory might lead to a new vaccines for childhood diseases or
how applied projects might lead to improvements in bioenergy
production,&#x201D; Baxter said. &#x201C;For many of the students, the symposium
marks their first research presentation to the broader scientific
community. That&#x2019;s a major milestone &#x2013; somewhere between their first
science fair and a job as a scientist or engineer or a future
PhD.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the National Science Foundation, from 1997 to 2006,
roughly 7,000 individuals with a bachelor&apos;s degree from CSU
campuses went on to receive research-based doctoral degrees. (With
the exception of recently announced nursing doctorates, the CSU
itself does not award doctoral degrees in science.)</p>
