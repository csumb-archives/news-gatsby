<h4>CSUMB&#x2019;s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute brings adults back to
school</h4>
<p>People looking to expand their horizons without having to travel
far from home should check out the Osher Lifelong Learning
Institute at California State University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>OLLI resumes classes this month with a diverse range of courses,
speakers and events specifically for those 50 and older.</p>
<p>With support from the Bernard Osher Foundation, OLLI at CSUMB is
part of a national network that recognizes learning and exploration
have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a fresh look at
themselves, their world, and the possibilities that await them.</p>
<p>The program started with 100 members in 2007 and has grown each
semester. By the end of this semester, a membership of 500 will
trigger a $1 million grant from the Osher Foundation that will help
to ensure the long-term stability of the program.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are the OLLI Writers&apos; Circle and
several other writing and literature classes and workshops; The
Fishes of Monterey Bay; Monterey&#x2019;s Visual Art History, taught by
Dick Crispo; Monterey Waterfront, taught by Tim Thomas; and In Your
Ancestor&#x2019;s Footsteps, an introduction to genealogy.</p>
<p>Back by request is Cinema and Cuisine, a look at Academy
Award-winning films with each of the screenings accompanied by a
tasty treat.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a four-session
look at the new administration in Sacramento. And popular MPC
instructor John Provost will offer an eight-week class exploring
the mysteries of meditation.</p>
<p>Most of the classes will be held on the CSUMB campus; several
will be offered at locations in the local community.</p>
<p>Community members can purchase individual OLLI class offerings
or may become members by paying $99 for the semester, which
includes tuition for three OLLI courses. A mini-membership &#x2013; good
for one class &#x2013; is available for $45. Both membership levels
include a parking pass, invitations to social events, discounts to
the university&#x2019;s sports center, swimming pool, athletic events and
World Theater performances.</p>
