<h4>CSUMB wins HP award<br>
<em>Math program selected as one of 10 exemplary projects
worldwide</em></br></h4>
<p>Cal State Monterey Bay has earned an EdTech Innovators Award
from Hewlett Packard and the New Media Consortium. The award
recognizes pioneers in education who are using technology in
groundbreaking ways.</p>
<p>According to HP, CSUMB&#x2019;s project, &#x201C;Leapfrogging Mathematics in
the Early Start Program,&#x201D; stood out because it&#x2019;s a proven example
of an educational project that uses technology in novel ways inside
and outside the classroom.<br>
<br>
The EdTech Innovators Award includes a technology grant of $40,000
and membership in a social network designed for educators. Only 10
winners were selected &#x2013; 4 percent of applications &#x2013; representing
educational institutions in the U.S., India, Costa Rica, South
Africa, Canada and Brazil.<br>
<br>
The new grant allows high school math teachers and students to
attend four weeks of math &#x201C;boot camp&#x201D; during the summer. The high
school teachers will partner with CSUMB faculty members on new
educational strategies using tablet PCs &#x2013; personal computers
equipped with touch screens &#x2013; that address the needs of remedial
math students.<br>
<br>
The project&#x2019;s goals are to reduce the percentage of college
freshmen who need remedial math from 60 percent to under 40
percent; to help high school teachers invigorate their courses and
collaborate with college professors on curriculum; and to document
the work so that it can be used on campuses across the
country.<br>
<br>
Leapfrogging Math is a new program, but it builds on CSUMB&#x2019;s
successes in courses using tablet PC technology. Working with HP,
the university has created a remedial math program that serves
about 500 of its own freshmen each year. More than 92 percent of
students are passing the two-semester course, compared to the
national rate of just under 50 percent.<br>
<br>
In recognition of the university&#x2019;s innovative work to integrate
mobile technologies across the curriculum, HP has awarded four
technology grants to CSUMB&#x2019;s Wireless Education and Technology
Center since 2003.<br>
