<p>Daniel de la Cruz, a senior at California State University,
Monterey Bay, has received the prestigious William Randolph
Hearst/CSU Trustees&apos; Award for Outstanding Achievement. De la Cruz,
who is majoring in telecommunications, multimedia, and applied
computing, is in his final semester at CSUMB. He will be honored at
a ceremony at the September Board of Trustees meeting in Long
Beach.<br>
<br>
The award provides financial support to students who show superior
academic performance and community service in the face of personal
hardship and challenges. Each honoree receives $3,000. This year,
12 students from across the 23-campus CSU system were
honored.<br>
<br>
At 12, de la Cruz was orphaned and, without parents to guide him,
dropped out of school. At 22, he was diagnosed with the same
enzyme-deficiency disorder that claimed his mother&apos;s life. Refusing
to be discouraged, he enrolled in computer courses, used the
Internet to locate a New York geneticist who was working on a
treatment for his condition, and undertook an experimental and
ultimately successful therapy. His interest in computer technology
was reinforced by this experience and his goal is to earn a
graduate degree in information technology, which he plans to apply
to help others overcome barriers in society.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was astounded when I got the call that I had won the award,&quot;
said de la Cruz. &quot;You do what you do without thought of outside
recognition. So, I was stunned and humbled and filled with
gratitude. Receiving this award has exceeded all of my
expectations. Maybe it will help others dream big when they see
what I&apos;ve done.&quot;<br>
<br>
The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an endowed
scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain. In 1999, the foundation partnered with the CSU
Board of Trustees to create the Hearst/Trustees&apos; Award for
Outstanding Achievement. Contributions from CSU Trustees and
private donors supplement the endowment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
