<h3>Open house scheduled for Jan. 27 at CSUMB</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to
learn more about the master&#x2019;s degree program in Instructional
Science and Technology at an open house on Jan. 27.</p>
<p>The event will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Alumni and
Visitors Center on Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Several current
students and graduates of the program will share their experience
and how they are applying the skills they acquired to their current
work.</p>
<p>The 16-month program will start in August. Application deadline
is March 15.</p>
<p>The Master&#x2019;s in Instructional Science and Technology program
prepares students for positions in the fast-changing fields of
modern education and training. The hybrid learning experience &#x2013;
which integrates several days on campus at the beginning of each
semester with online classes &#x2013; enables graduates to advance in
their current careers and will position them to assume leadership
roles in education and training.</p>
<p>Successful educators and e-learning developers in the
knowledge-based, global economy require command of all the
technological tools and methodologies available to them; the MIST
program is designed to provide students with those skills.</p>
