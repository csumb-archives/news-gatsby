<p>The San Jose-Silicon Valley Chapter of the California Society of
Certified Public Accountants has awarded scholarships to a pair of
CSU Monterey Bay students.</p>

senior, and John McGoldrick, a junior, were presented CalCPA
scholarships at an event on Jan. 26. Both are business students in
the accounting concentration. They were selected as the
organization&#x2019;s outstanding 2011 senior and junior students,
respectively.</img></p>
<p>As the outstanding senior, Fuller&apos;s name will be engraved on the
CalCPA scholarship recipient plaque on display in the office of
CSUMB&apos;s School of Business.</p>
<p>Students from Cabrillo and Gavilan colleges, Monterey Peninsula
College, UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State and Santa Clara universities
also received scholarships and were honored that night.</p>
<p>The scholarship recipients also receive a one-year student
membership in the organization.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I could sense the pride of the professional membership to see
so many well dressed, aspiring accountants from so many colleges,&#x201D;
Fuller said. &#x201C;Even after the event ended, many members stayed to
congratulate and thank the students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The California Society of Certified Public Accountants is the
nation&#x2019;s largest statewide association of CPAs. Founded in 1909,
CalCPA represents over 34,000 members.</p>
