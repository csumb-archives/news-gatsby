<h3>Filmmaker named &apos;CSU Outstanding Alumni&apos;</h3>
<p>Doug Harris has been a successful filmmaker for 15 years. He
perfected his media skills by earning a Master of Arts in
Interdisciplinary Studies at CSU Monterey Bay in 1998.</p>
<p>His most recent documentary, &#x201C;Out: The Glenn Burke Story,&#x201D; was
shown on Comcast SportsNet television and has been featured in a
variety of media outlets, including the San Francisco Chronicle,
Oakland Tribune, Los Angeles Times, ESPN and The Nation magazine,
among others.</p>
<p>It aired Nov. 10, and was screened at San Francisco&#x2019;s Castro
Theatre the next night.</p>
<p>Burke, an outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Oakland A&#x2019;s
in the late 1970s, was major-league baseball&#x2019;s first openly gay
player. His story makes for a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>In the film, friends and former teammates rave about Burke&#x2019;s
athletic ability and talk about his gregarious nature &#x2013; one friend
described him as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor.
But the story has a sad &#x2013; and premature &#x2013; ending. Burke abruptly
retired from baseball in 1980, publicly revealed his homosexuality
two years later and died of complications from AIDS in 1995, at age
42.</p>
<p>Harris, co-producer of the film, brought a unique perspective to
the project. He grew up in Berkeley, as did Burke. They played
summer pickup basketball games together at Cal&#x2019;s Harmon Gym in the
1970s.</p>
<p>In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Harris said
Burke motivated and inspired the athletes who came along behind him
at Berkeley High. &#x201C;He was icon in Berkeley, for all of us,&#x201D; Harris
told the Chronicle.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think Glenn could have been a much better player if he didn&#x2019;t
have the stress, this weight on his chest of constantly dealing
with who he was,&#x201D; Harris said.</p>
<p>The social stigma of gay athletes is still difficult for many
people to accept. Telling a tale from more than 30 years ago offers
a barometer about where we are now, and where we were then, Carl
Steward pointed out in the Oakland Tribune.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It would be nice if viewers look at this film and take a
personal assessment of their whole level of acceptance, not
necessarily dealing just with the gay issue but acceptance
overall,&#x201D; Harris told the Tribune.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, Harris combined classes in physical education and
Teledramatic Arts and Technology to earn his master&#x2019;s degree. It
allowed him to further his principal passions: helping young people
succeed through athletics and producing documentary videos of value
to the community.<br>
The same year he enrolled at CSUMB, he established the Digital
Technology Academy through Athletes United for Peace, an Oakland
non-profit organization. He served as the executive director of AUP
from 1995 through 2009 and has held a variety of media-related
positions with government agencies and nonprofits.</br></p>
<p>Another of his documentaries, &#x201C;Bounce: The Don Barksdale Story,&#x201D;
grew out of his CSUMB capstone project. In a Los Angeles Times
article about the film, Harris described Barksdale as &#x201C;kind of like
the Jackie Robinson of basketball.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As chronicled in Harris&apos; documentary, Barksdale was named
college basketball&#x2019;s first black All-American as a senior at UCLA
in 1947. He was the first black basketball player on the U.S.
Olympic team, winning a gold medal in London in 1948. He broke the
color line in the AAU&apos;s national industrial league, which welcomed
him when the NBA would not. And he was the first African American
to play in the NBA All-Star game, suiting up for the East in
1953.</p>
<p>Harris&apos; efforts have helped land Barksdale in halls of fame
honoring California community college athletes, African American
athletes, Bay Area athletes and Pacific 10 Conference athletes. &quot;I
would like young people to know about Don, know about his legacy,
the way they know about Jackie Robinson,&quot; Harris told The
Times.</p>
<p>Harris has been named to the most recent group of &quot;CSU
Outstanding Alumni,&quot; a list put together in conjunction with the
system&apos;s Super Sunday initiative to encourage African American
youth to go to college. He joins athletes Ozzie Smith, Joe Morgan,
John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Marshall Faulk, Sharon Day and Tony
Gwynn, federal judge Janice Rogers Brown, former San Francisco
mayor Willie Brown, astronaut Yvonne Cagle, former Oakland mayor
Ron Dellums, novelist Ernest Gaines and actor Danny Glover, among
others.<br>
