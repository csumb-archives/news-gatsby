<p>In December 1959, a revolution in comedy began in front of a
small crowd in a former laundry building in Chicago.</p>
<p>An improvisational group called Second City gave its first
performance, satirizing the Eisenhower era.</p>
<p>Since then millions of people have attended Second City shows or
watched the group&#x2019;s many alumni on television or in movies. It has
been called the &#x201C;Harvard of humor,&#x201D; and among its former members
are Alan Arkin, Joan Rivers, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Mike Myers,
Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>Local audiences will have the opportunity to experience Second
City&#x2019;s brand of comedy when the touring troupe gives a performance
at California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on
March 3. Showtime is 7:30 p.m. The show is recommended for adult
audiences.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, the group will perform a show called Fair &amp;
Unbalanced, which takes unbridled comic pleasure in the foibles of
politicians, celebrities and even our significant others through
sketch comedy, songs and on-the-spot improvisation.</p>
<p>World Theater executive director Joe Cardinalli&#x2019;s decision to
book an improv comedy show was easy once he heard that Second City
was available and touring the West Coast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is definitely an evening to enjoy and to laugh out loud,&#x201D;
Cardinalli said. &#x201C;Everyone tells us that laughter is the best
medicine, so come and enjoy a dose of laugher.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Unlike other forms of comedy, improv isn&#x2019;t about the solo
performer; it&#x2019;s the ensemble that counts. Rarely is there a
dramatic opening or musical fanfare, sometimes no scenery or props.
Against a black backdrop are simple chairs and sometimes a
piano.</p>
<p>No institution escapes their satiric eye &#x2013; from the blowhards of
the Beltway to the Hollywood elite. It&#x2019;s a ride through present day
America.</p>
<p>Since those early days, Second City has added a theater and
training center in Toronto, training centers in Chicago and
Hollywood, 11 full-time touring ensembles and television and film
operations. But what brought national attention to the company was
&#x201C;Saturday Night Live.&#x201D; The TV program&#x2019;s original cast included
three Second City alumni &#x2013; Belushi, Dan Akroyd and Gilda Radner.
Since then, more than two dozen performers and even more writers
have made the move from Second City to SNL.</p>
<p>Perhaps a future SNL cast member or TV star will be on stage
when Second City performs at the World Theater.</p>
<p>Tickets range from $10 to $40 and can be purchased <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater" rel="nofollow">online</a> or by
