<p>Twenty-nine students and two faculty members from CSU Monterey
Bay are preparing income taxes for free during the next few months
at various locations around the area through the Volunteer Income
Tax Assistance program. VITA is coordinated by the United Way of
Monterey County.</p>
<p>The volunteer tax-preparers took training classes over the
semester break and were certified by the IRS through an exam before
beginning to work with clients. The student volunteers come from
the university&apos;s School of Business. Most are in the accounting
concentration; some are satisfying their service-learning
requirement.</p>
<p>The service is available at four locations in Salinas, and in
Seaside, Castroville, Soledad and King City. Some students also
work at locations in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>This is the second year that business students and faculty
members are volunteering with the program. Approximately $100,000
in income tax refunds was returned to clients, and by extension,
the local community, as a result of their work last year.</p>
<p>Susan Morse, service-learning instructor in the School of
Business, is &#x201C;always looking for ways to incorporate community
involvement addressing issues of justice, culture and equity with
activities that use and expand students&#x2019; business skills,&#x201D; she
said. &#x201C;VITA does both.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Accounting professor Cathy Ku was also involved with recruiting
students and coordinating the various agencies involved.</p>
<p>The program reaches out to low-income wage earners who can&#x2019;t
afford income tax preparation assistance or are not aware that they
may be eligible for tax refunds. To be eligible for the program,
household income must be less than $49,000.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The community also benefits from an infusion of otherwise lost
income as the refunds are, for the most part, spent locally,&#x201D; Morse
said.</p>
