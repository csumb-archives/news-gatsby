&#x201C;Love the Skin You&#x2019;re In &#x2013; Taking out the Social Programming that
Rules our Self-Images and Pocketbooks.&#x201D; She&#x2019;ll share the story of

program.<br>
<br>

The National Eating Disorders Association has proclaimed Feb. 20-26
as the 24th annual week set aside to talk about eating disorders
and unrealistic body-perfect ideals, and to fight for more
research, support and access to treatment for people suffering from
these life-threatening illnesses.<br>
<br>
Through NED Awareness Week, the national non-profit group seeks to
educate the public on signs and symptoms of eating disorders and
encourage people to get help. The goal is also to spread a message
of hope: Help is available, recovery is possible and those affected
are not alone in their struggle.<br>
<br>
According to the group&#x2019;s website, <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org" title="www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:">www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:</a><br>

<br>
&#x2022; Nearly 10 million females and 1 million males in the U.S. are
battling eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, while
millions more suffer from binge eating disorder.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; The peak onset of eating disorders occurs during puberty and
the late teen/early adult years, but symptoms can occur as young as
kindergarten.</p>
<p>&#x2022; More than one in three normal dieters progresses to
pathological dieting.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s Personal Growth and Counseling Center is sponsoring the
event in collaboration with the office of Student Activities and
Leadership Development, Student Housing and Residential Life, and
the athletic department.<br>
<br>
Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
