<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s School of Business and the local Small
Business Development Centers are about to begin work on a project
to improve the economic vitality of Castroville.</p>
<p>Monterey County&#x2019;s Redevelopment Agency has contracted with the
university and its small business development center for work on
the Castroville Commercial Improvement Project.</p>
<p>The first stage involves surveying residents and businesses. Dr.
Murray Millson, professor of marketing at CSUMB, has designed a
pair of surveys that will be carried out by university students
beginning Feb. 12. The surveys are designed to identify residents&#x2019;
shopping behavior, and find out what would encourage them to shop
locally. Then, business owners will be surveyed to see what they
identify as opportunities for improvement and as barriers to their
success.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s survey efforts will link with the Monterey
County Office of Employment Training, which has already interviewed
several businesses in Castroville about staffing needs.</p>
<p>Using information from the surveys and interviews, the SBDC will
determine what services would be helpful and assist business owners
in accessing those services. In addition, one-on-one private
counseling will be provided by the Central Coast Small Business
Development Center at Cabrillo College.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CSUMB&#x2019;s Small Business Development Center will work
with three anchor businesses in the community, helping to define a
market niche and maximizing tourism. This effort is intended to
increase the number of potential customers for all retail shops in
downtown Castroville.</p>
<p>Another part of the project involves gauging the success of a
culinary academy in the area.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Small Business Development Center normally focuses on
individual businesses,&#x201D; said Andrea Nield, associate director of
the center based at CSUMB. &#x201C;This project involves a community
development research role for the university. The collaboration
will yield better results for the community.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The project is scheduled to be finished in June.</p>
