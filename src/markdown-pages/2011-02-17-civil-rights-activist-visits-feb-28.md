<h3>Bob Zellner knows risks of fighting for freedom</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s celebration of Black History Month will
conclude on Feb. 28 when nationally known civil rights activist Bob
Zellner visits campus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Reflections on 50 Years of Activism&#x201D; will be his topic. The
free event will get under way at 7 p.m. in the University Center on
Sixth Avenue. The public is invited.</p>

Alabama, the son and grandson of Ku Klux Klan members, Zellner
rejected racism and fought for civil rights along with his mentor,
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today, he is seen as one of the most
influential white Southerners of the civil rights movement of the
1960s.</img></p>
<p>In his memoir, &#x201C;The Wrong Side of Murder Creek: A White
Southerner in the Freedom Movement,&#x201D; he recounts how a race
relations class in college and young activists who were organizing
sit-ins inspired him to make a difference in the segregated
South.</p>
<p>That led him to take part in some of the most notable events of
the movement &#x2013; as a Freedom Rider, a leader in Freedom Summer, and
a participant in marches, sit-ins and protests. He was beaten,
imprisoned and arrested 18 times in seven states on charges
including criminal anarchy and &#x201C;inciting the black population to
acts of war and violence,&#x201D; all in an attempt to register voters and
bring about change and equality.</p>
<p>While studying for a Ph.D. in history at Tulane University in
the 1990s, he wrote a dissertation on the Southern civil rights
movement. He keeps the stories of the movement alive through his
work as a lecturer, his appearance in films documenting the era,
and his writing. His memoir is being made into a movie by Spike
Lee. He has taped a show with Oprah Winfrey that is scheduled to
air in May.</p>

<p>The Associated Students Cultural Enrichment Committee, Student
Activities and Leadership Development, and the Office of the Dean
of Students are sponsors of the event. For more information,

<p><em>He tells a story that is sometimes horrific, always
interesting and ultimately inspirational about a white Southerner&#x2019;s
commitment to racial justice.</em><br>
