<p>Parishioners at three local churches got more than a sermon on
Sunday, Feb. 20. They got a pitch for the value of a college
education &#x2014; straight from the pulpit.<br>
<br>
Cal State Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison, Provost Kathy
Cruz-Uribe and Vice President for Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs
visited churches in Seaside and Pacific Grove as part of a
California State University program called Super Sunday.<br>
<br>
On Sundays through February, dozens of administrators from the CSU
system are fanning out to more than 100 black churches across the
state to spread the gospel of higher education. The goal is to
increase the number of African-American students attending
college.<br>
<br>
Dr. Harrison reminded the congregation at Greater Victory Temple in
Seaside that CSUMB &#x201C;is your hometown university.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She told members of the congregation that CSUMB offers 18
undergraduate degrees and eight master&#x2019;s programs, and new programs
in marine science, environmental studies, Spanish, Japanese and
nursing are expected to be added in the near future.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s all work together to make sure children &#x2013; your children &#x2013;
take advantage of the educational opportunities offered at the CSU
so they become the educated minds that will take California to the
next stage of economic prosperity,&#x201D; she told parishioners.<br>
<br>
She said unemployment figures for California clearly demonstrate
the value of a college degree: While those without a high school
diploma have an unemployment rate of 19 percent, the rate for those
with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree is only 6 percent.<br>

begins early &#x2013; in the sixth grade, when students should begin
taking English. Algebra needs to be tackled in the eighth grade and
calculus in the 12th grade, Dr. Harrison told them.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This is why we are here today asking grandparents, parents and
mentors to push students to work harder in middle and high school,&#x201D;
she said. &#x201C;Young people tend to achieve what&#x2019;s expected of them.
They need to know that we expect them to prepare for
college.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
University staff members passed out information and answered
questions at the end of the service.<br>
<br>
Dr. Cruz-Uribe conveyed the college-going message when she visited
Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Seaside; Dr. Higgs took the
message to parishioners at the First Baptist Church of Pacific
Grove.</br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
