<h2>Renowned school reformer Diane Ravitch has changed her
mind</h2>
<h3><em>Federal testing has narrowed education and charter schools
have failed to live up to their promise, she says</em></h3>
<p>The President&#x2019;s Speaker Series at CSU Monterey Bay resumes Feb.
23 when prominent education scholar Diane Ravitch visits campus.
Her talk will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth
Avenue.</p>
<p>Her topic: Will Education Reform Improve Our Schools? She will
use her best-selling book, The Death and Life of the Great American
School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education, as
the foundation for a discussion on the critical state of education
reform in our nation.</p>

research professor of education at New York University; a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution; and a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford. From 1991 through 1993, she was
assistant secretary of education in the administration of President
George H.W. Bush, where she led the federal effort to promote the
creation of state and national academic standards.</img></p>
<p>A former proponent of the No Child Left Behind Act, Dr. Ravitch
later became disillusioned by the test score-based philosophy and
has become one of its most vocal critics. &#x201C;We are judging students
by these test scores. They are not telling us how much students are
learning. They are telling us how much students have been prepped,&#x201D;
Ravitch has said.<br>
<br>
In the book, she critiques the punitive uses of accountability to
fire teachers and close schools, as well as replacing public
schools with charter schools and relying on superstar teachers.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;We should have a long-term plan in which we improve the quality
of the teaching force, have higher educational expectations for
those who come into teaching. We should begin to think about an
improved profession, better assessments and insisting on this
vision of education in which kids get a broad, rich and coherent
curriculum, rather than basic skills only,&#x201D; she said in her latest
book.</p>
<p>Dr. Ravitch shares a blog called Bridging Differences with
Deborah Meier, hosted by Education Week. She also blogs for
politico.com/arena and the Huffington Post. Her articles have
appeared in many newspapers and magazines.</p>
