<p>Kevin Johnson took a top honor at the inaugural Emerging
Researchers National Conference in Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math, held Feb. 24 and 25 in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><img alt=" Kevin Johnson, Erin Stanfield" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kevin_johson_erin_stanfield.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:283px">A biology major,
Johnson won first place in the Ecology, Environmental and Earth
Sciences division for his poster presentation.</img></p>
<p>He summarized research he started last summer, when he worked
with graduate student Erin Stanfield. The project began as an
internship with the Santa Cruz Water Department, a position that
was arranged through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center
at CSU Monterey Bay and funded by the Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority Participation.</p>
<p>His research involves observing what types of cyanobacteria &#x2013; a
blue-green algae &#x2013; are present in Loch Lomond and Pinto Lake, and
whether or not they have the potential to produce microcystin, a
liver toxin that has been linked to sea otter deaths in Monterey
Bay. The World Health Organization has set limits on the amount of
microcystin in sources of recreational and drinking water.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are looking at Pinto Lake in Watsonville because it&#x2019;s a
recreational body of water that has produced large blooms of
cyanobacteria. And we&#x2019;re looking at Loch Lomond because it&#x2019;s the
source of drinking water for Santa Cruz,&#x201D; Johnson said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re
using both environmental and molecular lab techniques in order to
identify potential toxicity at each lake.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This research will inform water management agencies in
Watsonville and Santa Cruz regarding water quality,&#x201D; Johnson
said.</p>
<p>The conference was designed to help students enhance their
science communication skills, better understand how to prepare for
science careers in a global workforce, and to find out about
summer, graduate school, and employment opportunities. It was
co-sponsored by American Association for the Advancement of Science
and the National Science Foundation and aimed at students who
participate in programs funded by the NSF. His travel expenses,
registration fees and hotel were covered by the AAAS.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great example of how research mentoring can propel
our students to academic and research excellence,&quot; said Dr. Bill
Head, director of UROC.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The junior from San Benito County has had experience talking
about his work. He was selected to attend the CSU Program for
Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) conference in
early January, where he also made a poster presentation.</p>
