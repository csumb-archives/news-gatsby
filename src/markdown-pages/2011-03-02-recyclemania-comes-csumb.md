<h3>Glass, Plastic, Paper, Oh My</h3>
<p>Glass, plastic containers, paper and aluminum cans &#x2013; they all
have their place at CSU Monterey Bay. And it&#x2019;s not in trash
cans.</p>
<p>Campus recycling efforts got a big boost in the fall of 2009,
when each room in the residence halls and all East Campus
apartments were equipped with bright blue recycling bins &#x2013; 3,100 in
all. That&#x2019;s about the time the university&#x2019;s custodial contract was
updated to include emptying of employees&#x2019; desk-side recycling
bins.</p>

measuring itself against other universities when it comes to
recycling. As part of a commitment to reduce its carbon footprint,
the university is making its first competitive appearance in the
annual RecycleMania competition. (It participated last year, but in
the non-competitive benchmark division.)</img></p>
<p>RecycleMania is a nationwide, friendly student-led competition
that pits colleges and universities in a contest to see which can
reduce, reuse and recycle the most campus waste. It offers bragging
rights and special awards made out of recycled materials to the
winning schools.</p>
<p>During last year&#x2019;s 10-week competition, more than 600 campuses
collectively recycled or composted over 84.5 million pounds. The
2011 installment officially runs for eight weeks between Feb. 6 and
April 2. Leading up to the main event, colleges participated in two
weeks of non-binding &#x201C;trials&#x201D; that began Jan. 24.</p>
<p>This year, 630 schools &#x2013; representing six million students &#x2013; are
registered, 391 in the competitive division, 239 in the benchmark
division.</p>
<p><img alt="pitch in!" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/recyclemania-1.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:154px">Throughout the 10
weeks, CSUMB will report its recycling and trash weights and be
ranked on RecycleMania&#x2019;s results page. With each week&#x2019;s reports and
rankings, CSUMB can watch how its program stacks up against its
competitors. As results fluctuate, the campus community will make a
concerted effort to reduce and recycle even more. The first results
should be posted on Feb. 18.</img></p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to spread more awareness of recycling, to build our
own campus recycling program and to reduce our carbon footprint,&quot;
said Associated Students Environmental Affairs Senator Duane
Lindsay.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to prove that we truly are a sustainable campus.&quot;</p>
<p>The Environmental Affairs committee has established a group
called the Green Team that will handle the recycling efforts and
tabulate the weekly results. The Green Team also plans to work to
make campus events such as homecoming and commencement zero waste.
And it intends to hold random &#x201C;awareness walks&#x201D; around campus,
where students spotted recycling &#x2013; &#x201C;caught green-handed&#x201D; &#x2013; will be
given prizes.</p>
