<h2>&#x2018;Carmel-by-the-Sea&#x2019; gets first local screening</h2>
<p>The newly launched Monterey Bay Film Society will hold its first
big public event &#x2013; a screening of &#x201C;Carmel-by-the-Sea&#x201D; &#x2013; on March 19
at Sunset Center.</p>
<p>The film was shot on the Monterey Peninsula in 2009, with
additional on-location shots filmed recently to give it more of the
flavor of Carmel. The movie is about a 15-year-old boy who becomes
embroiled in a tale of international art forgery. It stars Alfred
Molina, Lauren Bacall, Josh Hutcherson, Hayden <img alt="Cinematographer Walt Lloyd checks the lighting for a shot of Dina Eastwood" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/dina_eastwood_sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:376px">Panettiere, and
Dina Eastwood (pictured at left, with cinematographer Walt Lloyd),
and includes many local residents as extras.</img></p>
<p>This will be the film&#x2019;s first local showing; it premiered
earlier this month in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The 7 p.m. screening is a fundraiser for the film society.
Tickets are $10 for students, $25 for general admission, and $100
for VIP seating and a reception. They can be purchased by calling
the Sunset Center box office at 620-2048.</p>
<p>The Sunset Center showing happened by chance. Producer
Michael-Ryan Fletchall had originally planned to premiere it in
Carmel, but moved the opening to Los Angeles for business reasons.
Then, he was contacted by CSUMB students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We were on the Peninsula to do some additional photography, and
were approached by CSU Monterey Bay students who said they were
trying to do a fundraiser . . . &#x2018;Would you be willing to have the
screening be part of the event?,&#x2019; they asked. We thought it was a
great idea,&#x201D; Fletchall said. That led to the Sunset Center
showing.</p>
<p>The film society is associated with the Teledramatic Arts and
Technology Department (TAT) at CSUMB. Its mission is to promote the
cinematic arts with year-round programs for the community and to
provide free media workshops for at-risk and underserved youngsters
throughout Monterey County.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The idea is to support local filmmakers by bringing artists to
the area. It will serve as an opportunity for the artists to do
community workshops and to speak to film students at the
university,&#x201D; said TAT chair and co-director of the society Enid
Baxter Blader. The society&#x2019;s creative director is Mike Plante of
the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p>Organizers have raised $280,000 in grant money and another
$70,000 from private donors to help fund their ambitious plans.</p>
