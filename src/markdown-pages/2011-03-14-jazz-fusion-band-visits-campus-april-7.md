<p>Jazz and world music fusion band Hiroshima will perform at
California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on April
7. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p><img alt="Hirishima jazz-world music band" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/hiroshima-small.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:212px">The group was
formed in 1974 by keyboardist and saxophonist Dan Kuramoto, his
wife June &#x2013; one of the world&#x2019;s foremost players of the koto, a
Japanese string instrument &#x2013; and percussionists/taiko players
Johnny Mori and Danny Yamamoto.</img></p>
<p>Its distinctive sound has its roots in East Los Angeles,where
Dan Kuramoto grew up. He heard salsa bands playing in the
neighborhood dance halls, his grandparents&#x2019; Japanese music playing
on the home stereo and his brother practicing jazz on the family
piano. &#x201C;It all began to mix together in my head,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>In the three-plus decades since the group was formed, it has
blended jazz, pop and rock with traditional Japanese folk music.
The resulting sound is a pioneering voice in the world music
movement &#x2013; introducing traditional Japanese instruments to a global
audience. And selling more than 3 million albums in the
process.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve always stood apart from other instrumental groups by
taking the graceful classical sound of the koto and experimenting
with varying American musical idioms around that,&#x201D; Dan Kuramoto
said.</p>
<p>Beyond touring with such greats as Miles Davis, Hiroshima&#x2019;s
members have done some interesting projects. Three of them played
on the soundtrack for the Oscar-nominated film &#x201C;The Thin Red Line,&#x201D;
and Dan Kuramoto has scored more than 50 plays, films and TV shows.
He served as musical arranger for the L.A. and New York productions
of &#x201C;Zoot Suit.&#x201D;</p>
