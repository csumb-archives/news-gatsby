<p>With better broadband service, residents could be alerted to the
dangers posed by forest fires. Medical information could be more
readily available to practitioners in rural health clinics. People
could have expanded opportunities to access education, and
grandparents could connect with their grandchildren via live
video.<br>
<br>
Anyone interested in learning about California&#x2019;s broadband policy;
digital literacy initiatives; cell towers, broadband and land use
issues; and fiber to the home is invited to attend a two-day
conference, Next Gen Broadband: Filling the Gaps for California&#x2019;s
Communities, to be held March 24 and 25 at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
Tanimura and Antle Family Memorial Library. The conference is
hosted by the university&apos;s Wireless Education and Technology
Center.<br>
<br>
Participants will share research and case studies focusing on how
broadband applications help to foster economic growth and job
creation, sustain small businesses, expand government and community
services, and offer incentives for new enterprises.<br>
<br>
Lev Gonick, chief information officer of Case Western Reserve
University, will deliver the keynote address via video conference.
His talk, &#x201C;Building the Smart Connected City: A Platform Vision for
the Future,&#x201D; focuses on bringing fiber connections to five
low-income neighborhoods in Cleveland. Researchers believe that
broadband, along with training and computers, may be a critical
factor in improving these residents&#x2019; lives.<br>
<br>
