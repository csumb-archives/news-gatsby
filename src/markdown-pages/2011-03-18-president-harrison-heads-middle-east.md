<p>When California State University, Monterey Bay President Dianne
Harrison travels to Jordan and Oman later this month, she will take
a step toward the goal of establishing exchange programs with
universities in the Middle East.</p>

of seven college and university presidents selected for the 2011
Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program. Her group will leave March
24 for the Middle East and return to the United States on April
8.</img></p>
<p>The seminar is an opportunity for them to learn about the
changing higher education scene in the Arab world and return home
to share opportunities for future program development in the region
with their respective campuses.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison and the other presidents are scheduled to meet with
campus leaders in both countries to discuss institutional mission,
resources, challenges and opportunities to work with American
partners. The trip will provide an opportunity to refine and expand
the international vision and agenda of CSU Monterey Bay and the
California State University system.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Seminar members will undoubtedly develop a better understanding
of these countries&#x2019; institutions of higher education,&#x201D; Dr. Harrison
said. &#x201C;As we share expertise and gain knowledge, we also will be
helping to break what President Obama has called a &#x2018;cycle of
suspicion and discord&#x2019; between the United States and Muslims
worldwide.&quot;</p>
<p>She pointed out that a major objective of participating in the
seminar is the chance to develop and strengthen international
exchanges and opportunities for students and faculty at CSU
Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe it is essential that we are inclusive of countries
from all parts of the world,&#x201D; Dr. Harrison said. &#x201C;And that includes
the Middle East. Our students and faculty can benefit by
establishing partnerships with universities in the Middle East. By
having their students come to the United States and to California
we also add to our existing diversity on our campus.&quot;</p>
<p>Since arriving at CSUMB in 2006, she has worked to ensure that
students not only understand the world in a global context but also
experience it first hand by studying abroad.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison&#x2019;s extensive travel abroad has given her a greater
global perspective and made her a strong advocate for international
education. During her tenure at Florida State University, she
participated in and oversaw international programs as a faculty
member and administrator. Her work took her to countries across
Western and Eastern Europe and to Vietnam, Israel, Jamaica,
Trinidad and Panama.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison&#x2019;s group will spend five days in Oman before moving
on to Jordan for five days. During that time, according to
information from the U.S. Department of Education, which
administers the program, the group will:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Be exposed to Arab and Islamic culture;<br>
&#x2022; Have opportunities to observe and compare higher education
systems with local counterparts;<br>
&#x2022; Meet with Education USA staff members who advise undergraduate
and graduate students seeking information about study in the United
States;<br>
&#x2022; Have discussions with administrators of study abroad programs for
U.S. students; and<br>
&#x2022; Have opportunities to learn of special higher education
initiatives such as the El Hassan Science City in Jordan and Oman&#x2019;s
development of a unified online admissions system.</br></br></br></br></p>
