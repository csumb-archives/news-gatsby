<h3><em>Comedian finds humor in his bid to survive</em></h3>
<p>Brian Wetzel was a successful stand-up comedian whose career and
personal life were absorbed by his struggle with clinical
depression, a struggle that left him on the brink of suicide
through his young adult years.</p>
<p><img alt="Brian Wetzel" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/brian_wetzel.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:188px">&#x201C;There is nothing
funny about being severely depressed, but I had to find humor in my
situation in order to stay alive and survive,&#x201D; said Wetzel, 46, of
Santa Rosa.</img></p>
<p>With that, he began to write an autobiographical, one-man show
about his 20-year struggle with depression that has since become
the focus of his performances across the United States.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My shows and speeches are important because there are too many
people in this world who are really hurting emotionally, and they,
in turn, hurt themselves or take the ultimate step and take their
lives,&#x201D; he told the Ventura County Star. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for people
to know there is help, but they have to be encouraged to not only
muster up the courage and energy to ask for help, but to take the
help, too.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s what I hope my work will do for people: entertain them,
and help them at the same time,&#x201D; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>At noon on April 5, Wetzel will present &#x201C;That Voice in the
Wilderness is Laughing&#x201D; at the Black Box Cabaret on the campus of
Cal State University, Monterey Bay. The public is invited to this
free event. The Black Box Cabaret is located near the intersection
of Inter-Garrison Road and Fourth Avenue. A campus map can be
downloaded at csumb.edu/map.</p>
<p>A repeat performance will be held at 8 p.m. for students
only.</p>
<p>His appearance is part of the university&#x2019;s observance of Suicide
Prevention and Awareness Week.</p>
<p>Wetzel&#x2019;s presentation will cover the many factors that
contribute to clinical depression and the complex issues that
surround living with and managing this disorder, said Gary
Rodriguez, prevention specialist with the campus Personal Growth
and Counseling Center.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He shares his experience and offers hope for himself and others
as someone who has learned to live with, and manage, his
condition,&#x201D; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Humor is a way to bring depression to the table in a new way
because the subject is something no one wants to talk about, Wetzel
said. &#x201C;My presentation is peppered with humor, including the top
five things not to say to someone with depression. My audiences can
learn more about this tough subject and they can laugh at the same
time,&#x201D; he told the Star.</p>
<p><em>Everyone really got a lot out of the presentation . . . I
believe those who have not been clinically depressed got empathy,
those who treat the depressed got understanding and ideas about
treatment and those who suffer from it got validation and a feeling
that they are understood and not alone.</em><br>
