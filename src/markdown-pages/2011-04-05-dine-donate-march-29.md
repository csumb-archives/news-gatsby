<h3>Dining Commons event raises more than $1,000</h3>
<p>It seems that people and food come together in times of great
tragedy.</p>
<p>After the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts
of Japan, Aya Kamata, an international student from that country,
contacted Campus Dining at CSU Monterey Bay with the idea of
featuring Japanese cuisine as a fundraising opportunity.</p>
<p><img alt="Aya Kamata, Japanese student at CSUMB, works to help victims of the earthquake" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ayarecipesfromhomewinner_000.jpg" style="width:300px; height:232px; float:left">Kamata and Sodexo,
the university&apos;s food service provider, had worked together in the
fall semester when her entry in the &#x201C;Favorites from Home&#x201D; contest
was selected as one of the winners. She had submitted a recipe for
tonkatsu, a meal traditionally served in Japan before a major
competition &#x2013; such as an exam or sports event.</img></p>
<p>Charles Wesley, campus general manager for Sodexo, readily
agreed to the idea. As a result, Tuesday, March 29, was designated
Japanese Relief Day. Food from that country was offered all day in
the Dining Commons. Fifty percent of cash sales&#xA0; &#x2013; on all food
sold, not just the Japanese dishes &#x2013; was donated to the relief
effort. By the end of the day, more than $1,000 had been
raised.</p>
<p>During the lunch and dinner hours that day, visitors to the
Dining Commons were able to get a lesson in origami (Japanese paper
folding), get their name written in Japanese characters and learn
some basic facts about the country.</p>
<p>Japanese exchange students at CSUMB, as well as students in the
Japan Club and the International Club began raising money to help
victims almost immediately after news reports broke.<br>
<br>
By March 17, when most students left campus for spring break, $700
had been raised. That money was&#xA0; donated to the Japan
Democratic Medical Organization. Donations are still being
collected at various locations around campus.</br></br></p>
