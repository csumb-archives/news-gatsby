<h3>Director Rodrigo Garcia on hand for April 8 screening</h3>
<p>The Monterey Bay Film Festival is back for its fourth year and
it&#x2019;s bigger and better than ever.</p>
<p>Now under the auspices of the newly formed Monterey Bay Film
Society, the festival has grown to two days and a pair of
locations.</p>
<p>This year&#x2019;s festival will be held April 8 and 9. It opens with a
showing of the Mexican film, Revolucion, at 7 p.m., April 8, at
Lighthouse Cinema in Pacific Grove. Tickets are $9 for general
admission, $6.50 for students.</p>
<p>One hundred years after the Mexican Revolution, 10 Mexican
directors collaborated on the film, reflecting on the meaning of
revolution in contemporary Mexico. It&#x2019;s made up of 10 films, each
10 minutes long, and showcases a wide range of voices from the
vibrant Mexican film scene.</p>

voices, Rodrigo Garcia, will be on hand to introduce the film and
answer questions after the showing. Son of Colombian writer Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, he directed the film&#x2019;s final segment, called &#x201C;7th
and Alvarado,&#x201D; referring to a Latino area of Los Angeles.</img></p>
<p>Garcia (pictured at left) has directed episodes for HBO series
including The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Big Love. His film
credits include Nine Lives, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at
Her, and Mother and Child, which was shown at last year&#x2019;s Sundance
Film Festival.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 9, the festival moves to California State
University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on Sixth Avenue.
Saturday&#x2019;s screenings are free, but reservations are requested and

all under 5 minutes &#x2013; will be shown starting at 1 p.m. Doors open
at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Some of the films were submitted by local teenagers, some come
from overseas. Several were made by CSUMB students. Teen films
include an animation from Afghanistan and local films from Rancho
Cielo, the Boys and Girls Clubs, and a music video made at the
Salinas Public Library.</p>
<p>About 3 p.m., &#x201C;True Stories,&#x201D; a program of innovative short
films curated by Mike Plante, will be screened. Since 2002, Plante
has worked as a programmer with the Sundance Film Festival and as
director of programming with CineVegas.</p>
<p>The Monterey Bay Film Society is presented by CSUMB&#x2019;s
