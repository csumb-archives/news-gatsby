<h3>Simon Silva lectures at CSUMB April 11</h3>
<p>Artist and author Simon Silva has channeled the difficult and
painful experiences of his childhood in a family of migrant farm
workers into bold and proud expressions of Chicano culture.</p>
<p>The community is welcome to attend his presentation on
&#x201C;Nurturing Creativity,&#x201D; set for 7 p.m., April 11, in the University
Center on Sixth Avenue on the CSU Monterey Bay campus. The event is
free; no tickets or reservations are required.</p>
<p>Silva is famous for his vibrant paintings that depict stylized
portraits of farm workers bending to harvest crops, suns radiating
heat and picturesque fields and valleys. He has used his painting
to empower himself, honor Chicano culture and honor the dignity of
farm workers.</p>

will provide parents, educators and other community members with
tools to help students become critical thinkers, lifelong learners
and confident leaders. He will reflect on his own experiences to
present art as a means of inspiring learning and as a source of
self-esteem, empowerment and cultural pride.</img></p>
<p>At first, Silva had a generic artistic style. He painted horses
and landscapes that he thought people might be interested in
buying. But literature changed his life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I had never been a reader,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The only thing read in
our house growing up was the Bible and the yellow pages. Then, my
brother-in-law loaned me a copy of &#x201C;Bless Me, Ultima&#x201D; by Rudolfo
Anaya.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There was so much material that was familiar in terms of
characters, story lines and some of the things I had gone through.
It was a real revelation and it opened up a whole new world for
me.&#x201D; The book set him on the right path to look at the experiences
in his life and to find value in them. &#x201C;Literature saved me,&#x201D; he
said. &#x201C;I had tried to run away from these experiences &#x2013; I was
carrying shame about them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Through Chicano literature, I was able to focus on Chicano
culture in my artwork. It&#x2019;s what I needed to paint&#x2014;not only for
myself but also for those out there who have no self-esteem. It&#x2019;s
an opportunity for me to tell a campesino, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re important enough
for me to paint and you&#x2019;re also important enough to write
about.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Through my paintings and writings, I&#x2019;m able to make a powerful
situation out of what I had been ashamed of,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The same
can be said for ethnicity. If you&#x2019;ve been told all your life that
you are inferior and can&#x2019;t do it, you won&#x2019;t. I was fortunate in
that I had my art to keep me going.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by the Associated Students Cultural
Enrichment Committee, Student Activities &amp; Leadership
Development, and the Office of the Dean of Students. Books and
prints will be available for sale at the event.</p>
