discussion is &#x201C;Greenwashing vs. Sustainability . . . does virtue
ethics apply?&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Ever since the first Earth Day celebration more than 30 years
ago, some of the world&apos;s biggest polluters have invoked &#x201C;green&#x201D;
images. This deceptive marketing has become known as &quot;
greenwashing.&quot; Several years ago, the Oxford English Dictionary
gave the word a place in its pages, defining greenwashing as
&quot;disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an
environmentally responsible public image.&quot;</p>
<p>The term &#x201C;virtue ethics&#x201D; refers to a way of looking at
situations that emphasizes moral character rather than rules or
consequences, as the key element of ethical thinking. It focuses on
determining what a decision process indicates about the moral
character of a person, rather than what the outcome of the decision
is.</p>
<p>Iris Peppard, executive director of Everyone&#x2019;s Harvest; Kelli
Takikawa of Whole Foods; Kari Murray of CCOF, an organic
certification and trade association; and Dr. Suzanne Worcester,
professor of Science and Environmental Policy at CSUMB will make
presentations as part of the greenwashing panel.</p>

Communication will field questions on ethical issues.</img></p>
<p>The ethics panel is held annually to raise awareness of ethical
issues in business and social contexts. The objective is to help
people understand how to respond to ethical challenges in ways that
will contribute to their future success and well-being.</p>
