<p>Todd Hallenbeck will complete his master&#x2019;s degree in Coastal and
Watershed Science &amp; Policy this spring. A San Jose native,
Hallenbeck is also the recipient of a Sea-Grant West Coast
Governor&#x2019;s Agreement Fellowship.</p>
<p>This fellowship allows him to work with state and federal
agencies for two years, implementing progressive regional marine
policy off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>Hallenbeck&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s thesis, concerning the distribution of
biological communities in soft sediment habitats of Monterey Bay,
helped prepare him for that challenge.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This will be an incredible opportunity to witness firsthand how
science translates to policy,&#x201D; Hallenbeck said, &#x201C;and will put to
good use all the skills and experiences I have gained from being at
CSUMB.&#x201D;</p>
