<p>The university Athletic Department has hired experienced coaches
to lead the baseball, cross-country and men&#x2019;s soccer programs.</p>
<p>Walter White, a former assistant baseball coach at Sonoma State
University who also played professional baseball, is now in his
first year with the Otters. Athletic Director Vince Otoupal
said<br>
White&#x2019;s &#x201C;reputation as a teacher and recruiter is impressive.&#x201D; He
has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in kinesiology from Sonoma State and a
master&#x2019;s in education from the University of Phoenix.</br></p>
<p>In March, Otoupal announced selection of Rob Cummings as head
men&#x2019;s soccer coach. Cummings was associate head coach at Midwestern
State (Texas) for the past four seasons, including two Final Four
appearances and four Lone Star Conference crowns. Otoupal called
him &#x201C;a proven winner&#x201D; whose teams have record of success on and off
the field. Cummings has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in education from
Lindenwood University and an MBA from Rockhurst University.</p>
<p>Cross country coach Greg Rhines was hired last summer to direct
both the men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s teams. In his previous year as coach at
San Joaquin Delta College, he guided the women to a<br>
top 15 ranking in the state. Rhines, who also coached at the high
school level, has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in psychology from Sacramento
State University and a master&#x2019;s in counseling psychology<br>
from John F. Kennedy University.</br></br></p>
