<h2>Kiyo&apos;s Story</h2>
<p>Unlike many of her fellow internees, Kiyo Sato is willing to
discuss her family&#x2019;s experience during World War II.</p>
<p>For years, she has spoken to students, church groups and other
gatherings about how a frightened nation looking for scapegoats in
the hysteria after Pearl Harbor resulted in 120,000 of its
Japanese-American residents &#x2013; most of them American citizens &#x2013;
being thrown into heavily guarded camps in remote and desolate
places such as Poston, Ariz.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe in everybody talking about it,&#x201D; Sato told the
Sacramento Bee in 2007. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s something you
forget.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In 2007, she wrote an eloquent memoir, &#x201C;Dandelion Through the
Crack.&#x201D; In its latest edition, the book is titled &#x201C;Kiyo&#x2019;s Story: A
Japanese-American Family&#x2019;s Quest for the American Dream.&#x201D; It won
the 2008 William Saroyan Prize for Nonfiction.</p>
<p>Sato will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 14 to talk about her
life growing up in California, being swept off to an internment
camp as an 18-year-old student at Sacramento Junior College, and
ultimately surviving and succeeding despite terrible odds and
oppressive prejudice.</p>
<p>Her talk will start at 2 p.m. in Room 1188 of the Tanimura and
Antle Library. The public is invited to this free event.</p>
<p>Sato mulled over the idea of writing a book for four decades,
taking the occasional writing class. It wasn&#x2019;t until 2003 that she
decided to do it.</p>
<p>She told the Bee that she sees the book as a way to make sure
the forced internment of America&#x2019;s residents never happens
again.</p>

<p><em>It is a magnificent memoir, fully worthy of being compared
to Farewell to Manzanar. I cannot praise its pointillist realism,
its Zen-like austerity, highly enough. Exquisite.</em><br>
