<h3>&#x2018;Musical conversation&#x2019; features Oakland-based dance
company</h3>
<p>Catalyst: One by One, a collaboration between the Dimensions
Dance Theater and jazz composer Khalil Shaheed, will get its world
premiere at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s annual Heritage Music Festival on
April 16.</p>
<p>The 7 p.m. performance will be held in the University Center
ballroom on Sixth Avenue and is free. No tickets or reservations
are required.</p>

founder and artistic director of the Oakland-based dance company,
has collaborated with world renowned musicians, poets, rappers and
other dance companies for decades.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been doing it a really long time. The first was back in
the 1980s,&#x201D; she told the Oakland Tribune. &#x201C;It was a way to continue
to present the work from an African aesthetic, which includes
everything &#x2013; drama, dance, song and spoken word. It&#x2019;s not broken up
into little boxes the way we do in America,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>The process for each collaboration is different, depending on
the inspiration for the piece. &#x201C;I might have a message I want to
get across or something I am interested in investigating or
commenting on,&#x201D; Vaughan said.</p>
<p>At the heart of her collaboration with Shaheed is the artists&#x2019;
shared belief that art can shift consciousness and bring about
transformation in the lives of those who create, experience and are
touched by it.</p>
<p>In Catalyst, Vaughan and Shaheed focus on the underlying idea of
tolerance, and our ability to accept difference. The work will be
performed with dancers and drummers from Dimensions Dance Theater,
with music performed live by Shaheed and members of the Mo&#x2019; Rockin
Band. Vaughan calls it a &#x201C;movement-based musical conversation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Catalyst celebrates the confluence of dance and music in the
region of Morocco and North Africa, where African, Spanish and Arab
cultures have co-existed for centuries. Vaughan combines
traditional African dance forms with contemporary forms to respond
to the music&#x2019;s rhythms, energy and emotion; Shaheed&#x2019;s score
includes song and instrumentation for both traditional instruments
&#x2013; oud, gimbri and karkabas &#x2013; and contemporary jazz instruments.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By interweaving many different threads of music and dance into
a rich mosaic, Catalyst honors the beauty that results when we
celebrate our differences,&#x201D; Vaughan said.</p>
<p>The 12 previous Heritage Music Festivals have presented jazz
musicians. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking at a concept of moving toward a world
music festival rather than solely focus on jazz,&#x201D; said Professor
Richard Bains, chair of the Music and Performing Arts Department,
the festival&#x2019;s sponsor. &#x201C;We are looking at multiple disciplines,
including dance. Dimensions Dance Theater is a great way to try out
this new approach,&#x201D; Professor Bains said.</p>
