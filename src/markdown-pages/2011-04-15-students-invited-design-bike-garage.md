<h2>Entries due May 31</h2>
<p>Submit the winning entry in CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s bicycle garage
design contest and win $350. The winning entry must be an indoor,
weatherproof, secure facility.</p>
<p>The contest kicked off &#xA0;April 11 with a visit to the
proposed site located east of the Institutional Assessment &amp;
Research Building on the main quad.</p>
<p>The project is paid for by a grant from the Monterey Bay Unified
Air Pollution Control District. It is intended to encourage people
to commute to campus via bicycle &#x2013; and reduce harmful greenhouse
gas emissions from vehicle traffic.</p>

to students of CSUMB, Monterey Peninsula College and the Monterey
Institute of International Studies. &#xA0;Entries will be judged on
feasibility, creativity, sustainability, place-making, flow and
efficiency of interior space, and effective use of exterior
space.&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>Entries should include a site plan, elevations, structural cross
section, eye-level perspective, sustainability criteria,
maintenance, operation costs, greenhouse gas emissions footprint,
and estimated construction budget. Projects must be submitted on
two &#xA0;24&#x201D; x 36&#x201D; sheets and a letter-size project summary. Other
items such as physical models, power point slides, and animations
are permitted but not required.</p>
<p>Proposed designs should consider several elements, including but
not limited to structure size from 300 to 500 square feet,
weatherproofing to limit rust damage to bicycles, video
surveillance mount location and cost, door with electronic card
access reader, building height to accommodate double-decker rack
systems (see Portland State University bike garage for an example),
and visual passage. CSUMB is a state entity and any structures must
comply with requirements of the California Building Code and
Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The deadline is noon, May 31. Please submit contest entries to
Megan Tolbert at CSUMB, Mountain Hall Suite A, or to Thomas
Rettenwender at Monterey Peninsula College.</p>
<p>Entries will be judged at a public display at the Monterey
Peninsula College Art Gallery on June 1. Upon submittal, designs
become the property of CSUMB. Winning project may or may not be
built as proposed, at the discretion of CSUMB Campus Planning &amp;
Development.</p>
