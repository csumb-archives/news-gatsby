were honored by President Dianne Harrison, Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe
and the deans. Five students received special awards and 16 were
honored for their Service Learning work.</img></p>
<p>The honors graduates will be among those receiving diplomas at
commencement on May 21.</p>
<p>After congratulating the members of the Class of 2011, President
Harrison recognized the parents, spouses, friends and family
members who supported the students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Undoubtedly, you have made many sacrifices throughout their
university career, encouraging their hard work and supporting them
when the light at the end of the tunnel seemed in the distance,
sometimes even unobtainable. And yet, here you are,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;You
are also to be congratulated.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Following the president&#x2019;s remarks, Deans Renee Curry, Brian
Simmons and Marsha Moroh introduced the honors graduates from their
colleges, then winners of the Service Learning awards and the five
