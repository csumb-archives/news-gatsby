<h4>Film fires up the engines of change</h4>

World Theater.<br>
<br>
After the screening, writer-director Josh Tickell and producer
Rebecca Harrell Tickell will be on stage to discuss the film and
answer questions.<br>
<br>
Though the film&#x2019;s premise is simple enough &#x2013; we are too reliant on
oil &#x2013; its ramifications (economic, environmental and political) are
enormous.<br>
<br>
The film is a highly critical, in-depth, personal journey that
examines a host of energy answers to America&apos;s oil addiction, as
well as offering a critique of the U.S. auto and petroleum
industries&apos; role in resisting change.<br>
<br>
Tickets are $10, or $5 for people willing to sign an Earth Day
pledge to make an effort to go green.<br>
