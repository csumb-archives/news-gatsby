teaches how to act heroically</p>
<p>Psychologist Philip Zimbardo will make a return visit to CSU

professor emeritus at Stanford University, first lectured at CSUMB
in September 2007, when he discussed his book, &#x201C;The Lucifer Effect:
Understanding How Good People Turn Evil.&#x201D; A standing-room-only
crowd packed the World Theater to hear him.</img></p>
<p>He has spent much of his professional life, including his famous
1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, examining how otherwise caring
human beings can be easily persuaded or seduced to cross the line
between good and evil. The actions of American military police
guards at Iraq&#x2019;s Abu Ghraib prison provide just one confirmation of
his findings.</p>
<p>Recently, he has set out to communicate the opposite: these same
people can speak out against evil and become heroes. The non-profit
Heroic Imagination Project is his effort to put that idea into
broad-based, sustainable action by encouraging young people to
think about real heroism and heroic acts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are such a celebrity-oriented society, for many young
people, being a celebrity has been equated with being a hero,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Heroes are ordinary people. You become a hero by doing an
extraordinary deed.&#x201D;</p>

Zimbardo told Monterey Herald columnist Peter Funt: &#x201C;Heroism can be
learned by example and reinforced with practice.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The definition of a hero that I promote is someone who acts
voluntarily on behalf of others in need, or in defense of a moral
cause, aware of risks and costs, without expectation of tangible
rewards,&#x201D; he told Funt.</p>
<p>The Heroic Imagination Project&#x2019;s pilot program began last
September at high schools in Oakland and Los Altos Hills. Students
spent the fall semester learning the principles of social
psychology that relate to heroism. They watched videos of such
famous experiments as Stanley Milgram&#x2019;s 1963 study on obedience to
authority and Dr. Zimbardo&#x2019;s own prison study. Students gained an
understanding of the power of the situation over their own behavior
as well as how to surpass these influences and act heroically.</p>
<p>Dr. Zimbardo is an internationally recognized scholar, educator,
researcher and media personality. He taught at Yale, New York
University and Columbia before joining the faculty at Stanford in
1968. He may be best known for his popular television series on
PBS, Discovering Psychology.</p>
<p>The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer
session moderated by CSUMB Professor Armando Arias.</p>
