<h3>Princeton Review calls campus &apos;environmentally
responsible&apos;</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has been named one of
the nation&#x2019;s most environmentally responsible schools by the
Princeton Review and the U.S. Green Building Council.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Princeton Review&#x2019;s Guide to 311 Green Colleges&#x201D; profiles
campuses that demonstrate notable commitments to sustainability in
their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and
career preparation.<br>
<br>
The 2011 edition of the guide was released today, just two days
prior to the April 22 celebration of Earth Day. And it is online
only &#x2013; to save trees.</br></br></p>

was praised for its initiatives including the revolving Energy
Innovations Fund that supports energy-saving projects on campus and
repays itself through energy savings, and the 6.4-acre solar
installation that is meeting 17 percent of the university&#x2019;s
electricity needs.<br>
<br>
Also drawing praise was the university&#x2019;s food service operations,
which include organic foods, compostable packaging and serving
products, and recycling of cooking oil. All buildings on campus
have designated recycling areas, and the ubiquity of the blue
recycle bins has helped the university achieve a 50 percent waste
diversion rate.<br>
<br>

opportunities, which allow students to take courses in subjects as
diverse as environmental writing and food ethics, were also
cited.<br>
<br>
The guide pointed out that CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s commitment to green
continues all the way to graduation &#x2013; when students cross the stage
to receive their degrees in gowns sewn with material made from
recycled plastic bottles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s rewarding to be recognized for something that is so central
to our university,&#x201D; said President Dianne Harrison. &#x201C;Sustainability
is a core principle here. I hope this means that even more students
who care about sustainability will find out about us and choose to
study here.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Schools were chosen based on a 2010 survey the Princeton Review
conducted of hundreds of colleges to tally its annual &#x201C;Green
Rating&#x201D; scores for school profiles in its college guidebooks and
website. The survey asked administrators more than 50 questions
about their institution&#x2019;s sustainability-related policies,
practices and programs. Green Ratings were tallied for more than
700 institutions; those scoring 80 or above on a scale of 60 to 99
made the list.<br>
