<p>It&#x2019;s the fourth award for Almanzan in the last 18 months. In
2009, she was honored by the Radio-Television News Directors
Association of Northern California for best feature reporting on a
serious subject for &#x201C;A Second Chance in Salinas.&#x201D; The story
examined a program called Take the Lead, which pairs at-risk
youngsters with dogs surrendered to the local SPCA.</p>
<p>Last November, the same group honored her in the feature
reporting category for &#x201C;Rec Rehab Program Hooks National Interest.&#x201D;
The story profiled a group called the Monterey Bay Veterans, which
holds fishing derbies on Monterey Bay as part of its recreational
rehabilitation program for disabled veterans. The story also earned
her a regional Edward R. Murrow Award in the spring of 2010 from
the RTDN.<br>

Almazan started her journalism career in Iowa where she covered the
2000 and 2004 presidential races and Iowa caucuses for local
television stations. In 2005, she won the Stanley Foundation Award
for Outstanding Broadcast Coverage of Iowa&apos;s global connections.
Later that year, she returned to her home state of California where
she continued to work in television and simultaneously got her
start in public radio as a freelance reporter with Capital Public
Radio in Sacramento. In 2007, she joined the staff at KAZU where
she serves as host of All Things Considered as well as news
director.</br></br></p>
