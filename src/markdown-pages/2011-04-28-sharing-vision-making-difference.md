<p>In advance of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, an online film
journal called IndieWIRE.com took note of the &#x201C;considerable buzz&#x201D;
being generated by the film school at Cal State Monterey Bay and
other places somewhat &#x201C;off the beaten path.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Forget about USC or UCLA,&#x201D; the article said.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s answer to traditional film schools &#x2013; known as the
Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology Department, or TAT &#x2013; continues
to create buzz, win acclaim and produce graduates who find success
in the varied and competitive world of film and video.</p>

<p class="pullquote"><strong>Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology
major</strong><br>
These are examples of major learning outcomes expected for students
graduating with a<br>

of a creative<br>
project that synthesizes the major learning outcomes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>TAT integrates a sense of community into each aspect of student
experience, from collaborative filmmaking and festivals to service
projects in neighboring cities. A strong alumni network spreads
that sense of community to places like Los Angeles, supporting new
grads as they seek employment.<br>
Students get involved quickly &#x2013; getting their hands on cameras and
editing gear early.</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;You can start making films in your freshman year, where you
wouldn&#x2019;t touch a camera in most schools &#x2019;til you&#x2019;re a junior,&#x201D; said
Janaye Brown, a 2010 graduate. She is now pursuing a Master of Fine
Arts at the University of Texas, Austin, where she earned a David
J. Bruton Fellowship.</p>
<p>TAT resources more than suffice for the 163 students now in the
program, said J.J. Melancon, a senior who aspires to start a
production company on the Monterey Peninsula. &#x201C;There are four
different buildings you&#x2019;re able to edit in &#x2013; and great production
facilities,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff resources are equally varied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A lot of teachers are or were professionals in the field, so
they have connections,&#x201D; said Adam Younkin, a senior.</p>
<p>For example, a TAT project, the Monterey Bay Film Society,
employs Mike Plante, the associate programmer for the Sundance Film
Festival as creative director. &#x201C;He brings an unending stream of
internationally renowned filmmakers to visit,&#x201D; said Enid Baxter
Blader, TAT department chair.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s also visited our Capstone classes,&#x201D; Blader said, referring
to senior students&#x2019; thesis project. &#x201C;Each senior got to pitch film
ideas and get feedback from him one-on-one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The traffic heads Sundance&#x2019;s way, too. Two films by Cal State
Monterey Bay alumni &#x2013; Doug Mueller &#x2019;03 and the team of Robert
Machoian &#x2019;07 and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck &#x2019;09 &#x2013; have screened at the
prestigious festival in the past two years.</p>
<p>The senior-year projects culminate in the semi-annual, on-campus
Capstone Festival, set for May 20. Last year filmgoers filled the
university&#x2019;s 427-seat World Theater to view narrative, documentary
and experimental films.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely electric,&#x201D; Blader said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not only family
and friends; it&#x2019;s really the community coming out for this. That&#x2019;s
unusual for an undergraduate institution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Other events nearby provide opportunities for TAT students to
screen their films or gain curating experience. Student films have
shown at two Carmel festivals, in June and October; at Sand City&#x2019;s
West End Festival; and at the Blue Ocean and First Night events in
Monterey.</p>
<p>TAT started the annual Monterey Bay Film Festival, held this
year on April 9. Launched in 2008, it now draws about 300 entries
for the teen program. Besides California, they come from such
places as El Salvador and Armenia. Plante brings a collection of
programs, some straight from Sundance.<br>
The festival&#x2019;s budget was held together at first by duct tape and
paper clips, but it has recently benefited greatly from grants and
private donations.</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Students get to see what it&#x2019;s like to curate and produce a film
festival,&#x201D; Blader said. &#x201C;They form relationships with visiting
filmmakers who become mentors to them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rachel Asendorf, a senior, was a producer&#x2019;s assistant for last
year&#x2019;s Young Filmmakers program, part of the MBFF.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I watched all the footage and helped categorize things,&#x201D; she
said. &#x201C;We pick which teen films will be in the festival. I wrangled
people for interviews and made sure everyone checked in. This
semester I hope to be stage manager.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Students&#x2019; interaction with teens &#x2013; and sometimes children &#x2013;
becomes more direct in the department&#x2019;s projects in service
learning, which integrates the experience of public service into
the academic major.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I love making films, but I found what I really wanted to do was
impact youths&#x2019; lives in any way I could &#x2013; by telling stories or
just being a friend or role model,&#x201D; said Juan Ramirez, a 2009
graduate. His service learning project, &#x201C;Concrete Paradigm,&#x201D;
documented the struggles and hopes of detainees in Monterey County
Juvenile Hall.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Concrete Paradigm&#x201D; won awards for Ramirez and co-director
Stephen Sprague at several film festivals. The sequel, &#x201C;Letters
from Within,&#x201D; was tapped for a March 19 screening at the
International Family Film Festival in Hollywood. Ramirez, who has
since become TAT&#x2019;s community outreach coordinator, is making a
third film, &#x201C;Trojans Under the Helmet,&#x201D; that looks at social
pressures in Salinas through the eyes of athletes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t just film,&#x201D; Ramirez said of the juvenile hall
projects. &#x201C;We taught workshops there for a whole year. We got to
know them and were mentors.&quot;</p>
<p>Added Blader, &#x201C;The workshops teach teens to value their own
stories. They create interconnectedness and hope for kids who feel
alone. Juvenile Hall has about a 95 percent recidivism rate;
anecdotally we know the incidence is lower for teens we&#x2019;ve served.
Some have ended up in adult programs for filmmaking. They decided,
&#x2018;This is what I want to do.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s powerful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For her service project, Brown led a filmmaking class for teens
at the Salinas Public Library and overcame nervousness about taking
the role of teacher.</p>
<p>Not every TAT student wants to work in the conventional film
industry. Melinda DeRouen, a 2005 graduate, still shoots video but
focuses on stage-acting and radio work. And the film work of Brown
and Ojeda-Beck &#x2013; who&#x2019;s now in graduate school at the University of
California, Berkeley &#x2013; is geared as much to galleries as to
theaters.</p>
<p>&#x201C;(TAT) exposed me to experimental media,&#x201D; Brown said. &#x201C;A lot of
that exists in the art world. Had I not gone to CSUMB, I might have
worked in a traditional film program.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>&apos;ABOVE THE AVERAGE&apos;</strong></p>
<p>TAT doesn&#x2019;t just look at filmmaking, Blader said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a confluence between film and multiple histories of
storytelling,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x2019;re looking at the histories of theater, performance, art and
avant-garde image-making. This approach gives our students a visual
fluency that sets them above the average. This is why they are
recognized at international film festivals.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Graduates working in such commercial film centers as Hollywood
and San Francisco say the breadth of experience gained at Cal State
Monterey Bay helped get their careers off the ground.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought I just wanted to write and direct, but TAT opened my
eyes to everything that was out there.&#x201D; said Justin Bloch, a 2004
grad who now edits for the Discovery Channel in Hollywood.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Because I was familiar with both production and postproduction,
I helped organize the structures here. It was all something I had
done before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like many TAT graduates, Bloch has experience in reality TV. He
spent a few seasons at the Fox hit &#x201C;Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen.&#x201D; More recently
he edited a new show, &#x201C;Enough Already,&#x201D; for the Oprah Winfrey
network.</p>
<p><strong>GRADS REACH BACK</strong></p>
<p>TAT grads are a tight-knit bunch. An alumni reunion is slated
this spring for a Sunset Boulevard venue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gotten and given job leads for TAT students,&#x201D; Bloch said.
&#x201C;In L.A., we help each other. I&#x2019;ve become used to hearing
(managers) say they&#x2019;ll hire someone from the same school. They say
I&#x2019;m useful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Blader,&#x201C;It&#x2019;s more than references. They hire each other and
help each other make their projects, too.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Shawn Hovis is help-desk coordinator for Pixar Animation Studios
in Emeryville. It&#x2019;s an information technology job, but Pixar offers
him occasional filmmaking opportunities.</p>
<p>His live-action short &#x201C;Play by Play&#x201D; won the Children&#x2019;s Choice
Award at the Bay Area International Children&#x2019;s Film Festival and
has been accepted to the Cleveland International Film Festival.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Whether you make it or not, much of it is luck,&#x201D; Hovis said.
&#x201C;But you have to generate things from yourself. TAT gets you going,
but they expect a lot out of you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As 2010 ended, 2001 Oscar-winning grad David Kashevaroff began a
fourmonth, on-location stint in Vancouver, B.C., as first assistant
editor for the moon-landing thriller &#x201C;Apollo 18,&#x201D; due out in
April.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a unique movie in that they&#x2019;re shooting and editing in a
short period,&#x201D; Kashevaroff said.</p>
<p>Other TAT graduates have worked on such recent commercial films
as &#x201C;Coraline&#x201D; and the latest installments of &#x201C;Toy Story,&#x201D;
&#x201C;Terminator&#x201D; and &#x201C;Star Trek.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bloch said TAT taught him how to collaborate with others on a
project.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everyone has a small part that makes up the larger production,&#x201D;
he said. &#x201C;Working in L.A., I see people who lose sight of that and
fall flat on their face. A lot of people here only know
postproduction, so they don&#x2019;t even talk to people in production.
TAT students are able to bridge that gap.&#x201D;</p>
