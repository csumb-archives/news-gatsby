<p>From the moment it opened at 8 a.m. on Dec. 1, 2008, the
Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library has been the center of
student life at Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>

<p>Having watched construction for two years, students lined up to
get their first look inside the 136,000-square-foot structure. They
rolled through the doors in numbers that shattered records at the
old library. Those numbers have been climbing ever since.</p>
<p>The library features three classrooms, two auditoriums, 11 group
study areas (that can be reserved online), multimedia equipment and
an area designated for lessons in information literacy, along with
the stacks of books, periodicals and electronic information.</p>
<p>A caf&#xE9; and lounge spaces are also part of the building. In
addition, the university&#x2019;s information technology Help Desk
provides realtime tech support to library users.</p>
<p>It is also home to the Undergraduate Research Opportunities
Center, the University Writing Program, the Academic Skills
Achievement Center and the Student Success Center.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We talk about the library as the &#x2018;living room&#x2019; of the
university,&#x201D; said library director Bill Robnett. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the
intersection of campus life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With a three-story atrium, the building feels expansive.
Students can check out laptops and are encouraged to rearrange
furniture to suit their needs. The library is also active at night,
as both a social hangout and a place to study.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have people who seem to live here all the time,&#x201D; Robnett
said. It is especially beneficial for commuter students.</p>
<p>Some faculty members maintain office hours in the library, and
staff members hold meetings there. The caf&#xE9; is a popular place for
those purposes.</p>
<p>When asked about his &#x201C;wish list,&#x201D; Robnett doesn&#x2019;t hesitate to
answer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;An endowment to support the academic collection is an urgent
need,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;When I say &#x2018;collection,&#x2019; I mean all kinds of
formats, not just books. We want to get into more multiple-platform
content.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many students are pleased with the library just the way it
is.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The other library &#x2013; we&#x2019;d go in there to study and it was dark
and uninviting,&#x201D; said junior Madison Gipe. &#x201C;This one is really
geared for students. And they serve the best coffee. I&#x2019;m in here
nearly every day.&#x201D;</p>
