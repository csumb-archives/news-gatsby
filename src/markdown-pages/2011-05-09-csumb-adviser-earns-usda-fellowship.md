<h2>Ejan headed to Washington, D.C.</h2>
<p>Jihan Ejan, a retention adviser with the Center for Student
Success at CSU Monterey Bay, was chosen to participate in the U.S.

named for the Texas Congressman and former chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee. It is part of the USDA&#x2019;s Hispanic-Serving
Institutions program.</img></p>
<p>Ejan is one of 13 college and university faculty and staff
members chosen for this year&#x2019;s program. Fellows experience
first-hand the education policymaking process and build linkages to
research and funding opportunities. In addition to meeting with
USDA personnel, fellows connect with and work on short-term
projects with other federal agencies and organizations such as the
Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, the
National Institutes of Health, the Commerce Department, and the
National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
<p>She will be in Washington from June 26 through July 16.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The opportunity to be a Fellow will further my understanding of
the educational challenges and career opportunities facing the
Latino community,&#x201D; Ejan said. &#x201C;With this information, I hope to be
a better advocate and adviser. The fellowship will give me ideas on
how to better serve our students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ejan joined the university in July of 2010. She earned
bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in sociology and Asian American Studies from UC
Davis and a master&#x2019;s degree in counseling with an emphasis in
college student personnel counseling from San Francisco State
University.</p>
<p>Her work experience includes academic and career counseling,
mentoring, college retention, college outreach and recruitment,
admissions evaluations and teaching. She has worked with students
at all levels &#x2013; from elementary school through university. She
previously worked at CSU Channel Islands, UC Berkeley, City College
of San Francisco, and for the nonprofit League of United Latin
American Citizens National Educational Service Centers, Inc.</p>
