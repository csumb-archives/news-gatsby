the Allen Griffin Award for excellence in teaching at the
post-secondary level. Faculty members from Monterey Peninsula
College, Monterey Institute of International Studies, Defense
Language Institute and Naval Postgraduate School were also honored,
as were elementary, middle and high school teachers.</img></p>
<p>Established in 1982, the Griffin Award was created by a bequest
from the late Col. Allen Griffin, former publisher of the Monterey
Herald and founder and former board president of the Community
Foundation. The award honors teachers who have a record of
sustained excellence in the classroom and who have made a
significant impact in the community.</p>
<p>Dr. Waltz joined CSU Monterey Bay in 2004 from D&#x2019;Youville
College in Buffalo, N.Y. He began his teaching career as an
interpretive naturalist for elementary children, but moved on a few
years later to pursue a master&#x2019;s degree in the arts of teaching,
and a teaching credential, at Beloit College in Wisconsin. After a
stint as a high school teacher, he earned a Ph.D. in the Social
Foundations of Education at the State University of New York at
Buffalo.<br>
