Six faculty members have received CSU research, scholarship and
creative activity awards.</br></p>
<p>The awards fall into two categories: mini-grants and
fellowships. Money is allocated by the Chancellor&#x2019;s Office to fund
the awards, which faculty members must use during the summer and
fall of 2011.</p>
<p>Mini-grants are intended as seed money to initiate, advance or
complete work that leads to a publication, exhibit, performance or
significant grant proposal.</p>

scholarship or research.<br>
