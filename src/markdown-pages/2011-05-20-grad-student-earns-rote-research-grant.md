<p>More will be known about raccoons, striped skunks, bobcats,
foxes and other mammals that live on former Fort Ord lands as the
result of a study by CSUMB graduate student Bart Kowalski.</p>
<p><img alt="Bart Kowalski" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/bart1.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:200px">Kowalski is mapping
the distribution of these animals on lands managed by the federal
Bureau of Land Management, the Army and the Fort Ord Reuse
Authority as part of his master&#x2019;s degree program in Coastal and
Watershed Science and Policy at CSUMB.</img></p>
<p>The largest share of the former Army base was deeded to the BLM,
which manages it for multiple uses including &#x201C;environmentally
sensitive recreation.&#x201D; His study will provide land managers with
information on the factors that impact the distribution of these
mammals.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If I find that areas with highly concentrated roads and trails
are less likely to be used by a certain species, then the managers
could take informed actions to limit the use of those trails,&#x201D;
Kowalski said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Alternatively, they would have the knowledge of locations to
open new trails with minimum impact to the mammals.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For his work, Kowalski is this year&#x2019;s winner of the James W.
Rote Grant for Research in Applied Sciences.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, Dr. James Lindholm, the James Rote
Professor of Marine Science and Policy at CSUMB, said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the spirit of James Rote&#x2019;s long career at the interface of
science and policy, Bart&#x2019;s project provides a clear linkage between
research and management of the natural world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Rote held a variety of
science advisory positions and helped draft environmental policy at
the state and federal levels. He was instrumental in getting
Monterey Bay designated as a National Marine Sanctuary.</p>
<p>He joined the CSUMB faculty in 1995, and was a founding member
of the university&#x2019;s innovative interdisciplinary program linking
natural science, physical science, technology, economics and
policy. Illness forced him to retire in 1997. He died in 2006.</p>
<p>The grant program is in its third year. The $2,000 award allows
students to purchase equipment for their research projects; the
equipment remains in the department for use by future students.</p>
<p>Kowalski came to the United States in 1992 from his native
Poland. After high school in Costa Mesa, he earned a bachelor&#x2019;s
degree at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I fell in love with the Central Coast, and after graduating,
moved around between Santa Cruz and Point Reyes (Marin County),&#x201D; he
said. &#x201C;When I decided to pursue a master&#x2019;s degree, I wanted to stay
in the area, so CSUMB was an attractive choice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He is planning to graduate in fall 2011.</p>
<p>Erin Stanfield won the first Rote Research Grant, which she used
to buy equipment for her study of algae in Pinto Lake near
Watsonville. Scott Toews was last year&#x2019;s recipient. His grant was
used to purchase equipment necessary for his research in the
mechanisms that drive genetic diversity in Monterey Bay.<br>
