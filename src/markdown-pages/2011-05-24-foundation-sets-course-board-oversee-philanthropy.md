<p>The new Foundation of California State University, Monterey Bay
is bringing community and campus leaders together to foster support
for the university&#x2019;s philanthropic needs and goals.</p>

For information on the Foundation of California State University,
Monterey Bay, contact Development at 582-3366 or by email to

<p>A 10-member board of directors meets in public at least
quarterly to review progress, build support for educational
programs and facilities, and promote awareness and understanding of
CSUMB&#x2019;s higher education mission.</p>
<p>President Dianne Harrison, who invited the initial directors,
also serves on the board. Mike Mahan, executive director of
university development, serves as the foundation&#x2019;s chief executive
officer, and Salinas attorney Robert Taylor is chair. Directors
include community members, faculty and student representatives.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The foundation is focused on where the community sees the
university going &#x2013; how the community can support the university,
and how it will support the community,&#x201D; Mahan said. Incorporated as
a nonprofit in April 2009, the foundation will provide stewardship
of charitable gifts to help fulfill the university&#x2019;s mission.</p>
<p>The foundation has taken over philanthropic oversight from the
University Corporation at Monterey Bay, which still manages CSUMB&#x2019;s
auxiliary business operations. The foundation will be able to make
private support its &#x201C;sole focus,&#x201D; Mahan said.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison said she is grateful for the directors&#x2019; service and
their substantial contribution to the university.</p>
