university from the Monterey Police Department, where he worked for
22 years. Most recently, he was the department&#x2019;s training sergeant,
responsible for creating, developing and scheduling training for
officers as well as overseeing the hiring of new employees.</img></p>
<p>A graduate of Monterey High School and Monterey Peninsula
College, Short has extensive experience working with law
enforcement agencies in Monterey County through various committees
and programs. He speaks Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
<p>As commander, he will oversee patrol operations, investigations
and records and evidence. He replaces Earl Lawson, who was promoted

&#x201C;John understands that the police department is essential to
ensuring a safe environment for students, employees and visitors
and helping to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning
and personal growth,&#x201D; Chief Lawson said.</br></br></p>
