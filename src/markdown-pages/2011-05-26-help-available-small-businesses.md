<h3>Builder finds a niche &#x2013; with help from the small business
center at CSUMB</h3>
<p>Like many small business owners, Shawn Bakker was doing fine
until the recession hit.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d just go from one job to the next,&#x201D; said Bakker, who moved
to Salinas from his native Colorado and founded his company, Bakker
Construction, in 2008.</p>
<p><img alt="Shawn Bakker" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/shawn_bakker_sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:325px; height:121px">A year later, he
realized that he needed to be proactive in his approach, rather
than simply react to the economy. That&#x2019;s when his lender referred
him to the Small Business Development Center at CSU Monterey Bay
for help.</img></p>
<p>Working with adviser Keith Holtaway, he developed strategies and
refined tactics that resulted in a shift in his target market to
home remodeling and improvements for small businesses.</p>
<p>By September of 2010, Bakker had hired eight new employees and
increased sales by over $800,000. He continues to work with the
SDBC and expects to reach $1 million in business this year.</p>
<p>For his success, Bakker has earned the 2011 Entrepreneurial
Success Award from the SBDC&#x2019;s regional office in Merced.</p>
<p>Bakker is just one example of the impact the SBDC has had in the
area.</p>
<p>Since it opened its doors in late 2009, the center has provided
2,475 hours of service to more than 200 businesses. It has trained
500 people, created 41 jobs, assisted with the start-up of 11
businesses, helped its clients increase sales by nearly $2 million,
and helped with nearly $1 million of capital infusion (from loans
or owner investment).</p>
<p>The center provides management and technical assistance to small
businesses and entrepreneurs in the area long the Highway 101
corridor from Gilroy to King City. From offices in Gonzales,
Salinas, Hollister and Gilroy, as well as the CSUMB campus, the
center provides critical services to small business owners, helping
to create and retain jobs in order to strengthen the local
economy.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Help is available to develop business plans, secure financing,
assist with marketing needs, set up financial systems, determine
plans for expansion, project cash flow, identify technology needs
and provide a variety of other services helpful to small
businesses. In addition to the free one-on-one consulting, the
center offers a variety of workshops and seminars.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&#x2019;s center comes under the auspices of the University of
California Merced&#x2019;s SBDC regional network, a fully accredited and
nationally recognized program.<br>
<br>
University faculty members make up about half of the 20 people
available to give entrepreneurs free advice. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got quite a
large skill set&#x201D; of counselors, said Andrea Zeller-Nield, associate
director of the center. Some of the counselors have knowledge of
key local industries, such as wine and agriculture.<br>
