<h3>Sacramento visit to advocate against more budget cuts</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison joined Chancellor
Charles Reed and her fellow CSU presidents today in a meeting with
Gov. Jerry Brown in Sacramento to discuss the state budget and its
impact on higher education.</p>

counterparts, Harrison was accompanied at the meeting by a local
business leader, Mary Ann Leffel, president of the Monterey County
Business Council.</img></p>
<p>Harrison said she was encouraged by Brown&apos;s continued commitment
to avoiding an &quot;all-cuts&quot; budget for fiscal year 2011-2012, which
could mean a $1 billion reduction in funding for the CSU.</p>
<p>&quot;The governor clearly understands how devastating an all-cuts
budget would be to our universities and to the people of
California,&quot; Harrison said. &quot;We are all looking to the Legislature
to fulfill its responsibilities and support the extension of needed
revenue.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown&apos;s proposed budget contains a $500 million cut to the CSU,
which would result in a deep $5.1 million funding cut to CSUMB. If
necessary state taxes are not extended, an additional system-wide
cut of up to $500 million would force the CSU to increase tuition
up to an additional 32 percent and possibly close admissions for
2012.</p>
<p>Harrison said the debate over extending the taxes is more
philosophical than financial &#x2013; a fundamental choice about whether
California should maintain its investment in such basic services as
higher education and public safety.</p>
<p>&quot;If we&apos;re not going to invest in these things, then we will have
to deal with the ramifications,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Leffel, who emphasized the role of higher education in preparing
a workforce to meet local needs, said a decline in state support
means that more qualified students will be shut out of the state&apos;s
public universities.</p>
<p>&quot;Educating fewer students will slow our economic recovery and
ultimately lead to a smaller tax base,&#x201D; she said.<br>
