<h3>Monterey County Film Commission makes award</h3>
<p>Dominic Parisi is this year&#x2019;s recipient of the $1,000 prize in
the Monterey County Film Commission&#x2019;s Film Student Scholarship and
Awards Program.</p>

be a senior in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, is
from Glendora. He plans to use the grant to help with expenses for
his capstone film, a documentary that looks at women who
participate in roller derby.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Dominic intends to explore the complicated relationship between
this women&#x2019;s sport and feminist ideas,&#x201D; said Caitlin Manning, a
professor in the TAT Department.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Roller derby participants often conform to social norms that
are oppressive to women, but many find the sport empowering to them
as women,&#x201D; Manning said. &#x201C;This won&#x2019;t be a puff piece on a trendy
new sport. Dominic is getting at serious and interesting social
issues in this documentary.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The award &#x201C;really takes a big load off my shoulders,&#x201D; Parisi
said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll cover some production costs and allow me to purchase a
camera that will enable more creative shots.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Manning described the aspiring film editor as &#x201C;a teacher&#x2019;s
dream.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He plugs away at his work quietly, comes for help when he needs
it, and responds well to feedback,&#x201D; she said.<br>

The Monterey County Film Commission scholarship program was created
to provide financial aid and incentive to students of film and
beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are enrolled
in a college or university in the county. The fund was established
as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey
County. Film commission board member Jeff Clark is the scholarship
program chair.<br>
<br>
The scholarship was created in 2008 and has gone to CSUMB students
each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo shared the
inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez &#x2013; who now works in the TAT
Department as a media specialist &#x2013; was the winner. Rachel Asendorf
received the award in 2010.<br>
