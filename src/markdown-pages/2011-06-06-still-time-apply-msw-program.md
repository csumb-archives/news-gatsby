<h3>Classes start Aug. 22</h3>
<p>A few spots remain for the fall 2011 class of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
Master of Social Work program. Applications must be received by
July 1.</p>
<p>The three-year program provides an opportunity for people who
are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance
in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is accessible
and affordable.</p>
<p>Students specialize in Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and
Families, and prepare for a broad array of job opportunities within
government and non-profits serving youth, the elderly, low-income
families, veterans, those who face health challenges and
others.</p>
<p>Admission requirements and application materials are available

<p>Potential students who are lacking a prerequisite &#x2013; human
biology and statistics are among the classes applicants must have
already completed &#x2013;&#xA0;are urged to take those classes as soon as
possible. If the prerequisites will not be met by August, please
consider applying for fall 2012 once the application window opens
in October.</p>
<p>Classes are currently offered in the evenings. Students must
also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per
semester starting in the second year.</p>
