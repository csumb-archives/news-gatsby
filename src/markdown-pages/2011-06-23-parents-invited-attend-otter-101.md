<h3>University holds summer orientation sessions</h3>
<p>A generation ago, college orientation was a perfunctory event,
focusing on getting the new students registered for classes.</p>
<p><img alt="The University Center was packed for orientation" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/orient_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:212px">Now, universities,
including CSU Monterey Bay, have made this annual ritual an
important part of the student experience, and include a separate
program for parents.</img></p>
<p>Otter orientation sessions are being held in June, with events
meant to showcase the campus to students who will enter in the
fall. All six sessions &#x2013; two for transfers, four for incoming
freshmen &#x2013; are at the maximum capacity of 200 students. The
freshmen sessions also have had more than 300 family members in
attendance.</p>
<p>The sessions are designed to ensure a successful transition to
CSUMB. Students have the opportunity to meet with an adviser,
register for classes, and learn about the university and how to get
involved with campus life. They are introduced to campus
organizations, student government, living and learning
opportunities, outdoor recreation and intramural sports. And they
get information on academic services, such as tutoring and
advising, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center.</p>
<p>While students are learning about the various majors and student
services, their parents and other family members have the
opportunity to ask questions of a panel of campus
representatives.</p>
<p><img alt="Parents attend a special session just for them" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/orientation_parents_2011_sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:225px">Dr. Christine
Erickson, dean of students, gave a short presentation called
Parents as Partners: Together in Transition. She told the audience
that the university treats students as adults, expects them to be
responsible, accountable and capable, and to seek out and use the
resources that are available to help them.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;We need you to trust that we have your child&#x2019;s best interests
at heart,&#x201D; Dr. Erickson said. And she reminded the audience that at
CSUMB, &#x201C;we really are committed to the success of each and every
student.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Parents had questions about how their students could get a
campus job (easily, using an online process), if skateboards are
allowed on campus (yes), how housing assignments could be changed
(only after the first two weeks, and only if space is available),
and if cars are necessary (no, there&#x2019;s good public transportation
and car-pooling).</p>
<p>New students will have the opportunity to make connections and
get involved during Otter Days Aug. 19-21, and at the Club
Showcase, which will be held in early September.</p>
