<p>With at least 75 percent of teenagers owning cell phones, it&#x2019;s
no surprise that the devices are playing an important role in
parenting.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s Rob Weisskirch, a professor in the Liberal Studies
Department, is among the researchers investigating how cell phones
affect the parent-teen relationship.</p>
<p>In a study reported online in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and
Social Networking, a peer-reviewed journal published by Mary Ann
Liebert, Inc., Dr. Weisskirch found that the nature of the calls
and who initiates them can affect the relationship.</p>
<p>He told the New York Times: &#x201C;What I found generally was that
when adolescents are initiating the communication and are seeking
out social support and guidance from their parents, then almost
across the board they tend to have better reports of getting along
with their parents.&#x201D;</p>

parents call and have a lot of communication around &#x2018;what are you
doing?&#x2019; or &#x2018;who are you with?&#x2019; or when they&#x2019;re angry at the child
and upset or scared, the kids report more conflict in the family,&#x201D;
Dr. Weisskirch told the Times.</img></p>
<p>Ultimately, his study shows, the phone is a tool that may
augment the parent-teen relationship but doesn&#x2019;t substitute for
it.</p>
<p>Dr. Weisskirch has been at CSUMB since 2001. He earned a Ph.D.
in human development from the University of California, Davis, in
1999, a Master of Social Work degree from San Diego State
University in 1994, a Clear Professional Multiple Subjects Teaching
Credential from the University of California, Irvine, in 1992 and a
Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and minor in Spanish in
1991.</p>
<p>He was a lecturer at CSU Fullerton from 1998 to 2001, a clinical
social worker in family service agencies and foster care group
homes, and as an elementary school teacher.</p>
<p>His research interests are the effects of language brokering on
children (i.e., when children acts as translators for parents and
other adults), acculturation, and ethnic identity development. In
addition, he studies the effect of technology on adolescent
relationships.</p>
