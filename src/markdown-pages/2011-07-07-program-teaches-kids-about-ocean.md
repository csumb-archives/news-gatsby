<h3>Slough of Information</h3>
<p>The CSU Monterey Bay-based Camp SEA Lab is in its second decade
of offering Science, Education and Adventure through summer
programs in and around the Monterey Bay area.<br>
<br>
Local teachers, scientists and resource managers who were concerned
about the lack of ocean-science education in schools started the
non-profit in 2000. About 8,000 children have participated in Camp
SEA Lab programs since then.<br>

closely with Monterey Bay-area research institutions. Funding is
provided by grants &#x2013; the California Coastal Commission&apos;s Whale Tail
Grant program and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
are major supporters &#x2013; and local contributors such as the Packard
Foundation and the Community Foundation for Monterey County.<br>
<br>
The youngsters &#x2013; most in grades five through eight &#x2013; come from the
Monterey Bay area, but a few come from other states and even other
countries. They take part in three- or five-day programs, day camps
or residential camps. During the school year, programs are offered
for entire classes; during the summer, youngsters participate as
individuals.<br>
<br>
Amity Wood, program director, says many of the children have never
been to the Pacific Ocean before, and have never done the kinds of
activities the program exposes them to: paddling a kayak in Elkhorn
Slough; looking at plankton under a microscope; dissecting a squid;
building a remotely-operated vehicle.<br>
<br>
For some of them, it&#x2019;s an adventure that will change the way they
look at the ocean, the environment and, just maybe it will change
the way they view science.<br>
<br>
Says Wood: &#x201C;The vast majority of kids who come through the program
aren&#x2019;t going to become marine scientists, but maybe they&#x2019;re going
to come away with a different outlook on the ocean and the
environment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;They&#x2019;re going to care about it,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;And if they care about
it, they&#x2019;re going to do something about it.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
This summer, the Science, Education and Adventure continue with a
variety of day camps and residential camps held on the CSUMB
campus, including several programs especially for teens 13 to 17
years old. Two of the programs are for girls only. Campers will
have the opportunity to interact with women scientists while
exploring careers in science.&#xA0;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
