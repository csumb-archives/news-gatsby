<h3>Collaboration with area community colleges to start next
summer&#xA0;</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay is preparing to offer
a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in nursing. Pending approval from the regional
accrediting body, the program will be available in summer
2012.<br>
<br>
<img alt="The sky&apos;s the limit with a bachelor of science in nursing" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/nursing_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:340px; height:180px">The university is
collaborating with established nursing programs at the four
community colleges in the area &#x2013; Monterey Peninsula, Hartnell,
Cabrillo and Gavilan &#x2013; in a unique way that avoids duplication of
effort and waste of resources.<br>
<br>
Students will begin the program at one of the community colleges,
spend several years in &#x201C;blended&#x201D; learning when they take classes at
their community college and the university, and then finish their
studies at CSU Monterey Bay. Along the way, they will receive an
associate&#x2019;s degree from their community college and a bachelor of
science in nursing from CSUMB.<br>
<br>
The students will be prepared to work in positions beyond the
traditional hospital &#x2013; in home, community and public health
settings. Their training will emphasize the relationships among
patients, their families and communities, and health care
providers. Students also will learn how to manage patients with
multiple chronic conditions &#x2013; addressing the needs of baby
boomers.<br>
<br>
The program will accept 25 to 30 students each year.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Prospective students frequently ask us about a bachelor of nursing
program,&#x201D; Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe said. She also pointed out that
there is strong community support &#x2013; and need &#x2013; for nurses with
bachelor&#x2019;s degrees. As many practicing nurses advance in their
careers, they find it necessary to obtain a graduate degree. To
facilitate that, it is critical to improve access to baccalaureate
nursing education.<br>
<br>
Although the recession has caused some nurses to delay retirement,
the U.S. Bureau of Health Professions projects demand will grow
over the next decade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>In California, the average age of nurses is 47 years; 45 percent
are over 50. In Monterey County, the current workforce is even
older &#x2013; 69 percent are over 55, according to the county&#x2019;s Workforce
Investment Board healthcare industry labor market study.<br>
<br>
A grant from the Foundation for California Community
Colleges/Nursing Investment Fund has supported planning.<br>
