<p>CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s online MBA program is now offering a second
track for students without extensive management experience.</p>
<p><img alt="An MBA prepares students the next step of their careers" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mba_0.jpeg" style="float:left; width:211px; height:239px">The new track began
in January as a pilot program and will now become an ongoing
program with a full cohort of students. The curriculum mirrors the
university&#x2019;s original online MBA program, with a focus on global
business, corporate leadership and technology, but includes more
case studies for less experienced students to analyze and discuss.
Aspiring leaders can now access the same dynamic learning
opportunities as experienced executives, gaining essential
knowledge, marketable skills and an expanded network as they hone
their business acumen.</img></p>
<p>The university will continue to offer its acclaimed online MBA
program on a track for experienced executives. Since the program
launched in 2009, participants have appreciated the opportunity to
learn with fellow professionals who can contribute their own
experiences to high-level discussions, challenging assignments and
&#x201C;real-time&#x201D; case studies. Students stay with the same group, or
cohort, throughout the two-year program, getting to know one
another, gaining mutual respect and building career networks.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is exciting to add a new track to our online MBA that allows
a broader audience to be able to take advantage of this innovative
education,&#x201D; said Chris Hasegawa, dean of Extended Education and
International Programs. &#x201C;When students graduate, they are ready to
move to the next step of their career armed with the knowledge and
tools necessary for success.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The online MBA program is a selective, fixed-curriculum,
graduate business program. Classes are developed to create a
technology-rich learning experience delivered exclusively online,
allowing access from around the globe. Students complete eight
courses over the two years: one course at a time, for eight weeks,
four times per year.</p>
<p>Interested candidates should call 866-757-5172 or visit
MBA.csumb.edu to learn more and start the application process. A
supportive advisement team is ready to assist candidates from the
beginning of the application process through to graduation.</p>
