<p>Anyone signing up for Environmental Science, Technology and
Policy 303 at CSU Monterey Bay had better like the outdoors.</p>
<p>The syllabus lists &#x201C;required hiking and camping equipment,&#x201D; a
hint as to what&#x2019;s in store.</p>
<p><img alt="Nineteen students made the trip" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/students_with_sign.jpg" style="float:left; width:315px; height:205px">During the spring
semester, 19 hardy students signed up for the ENVS &#x201C;California
Transect&#x201D; class and its accompanying two-week field course.</img></p>
<p>The classroom component prepared them for what was to follow by
introducing them to topics in California&#x2019;s scientific and cultural
history with an emphasis on human impacts on the landscape. They
also learned about the political history of water use.</p>
<p>Then, on June 1, the students &#x2013; accompanied by three former
students serving as volunteer teaching assistants, a trio of
instructors (Fred Watson, Susan Alexander and Thor Anderson) and
two kids &#x2013; set off to apply what they&#x2019;d learned in a real-world
setting of &#x201C;interdisciplinary science and social science
interactions,&#x201D; according to the syllabus.</p>
<p><img alt="Students were required to make presentations along the way" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/stu_presentation.snow_ecology.jpg" style="float:right; width:210px; height:158px">What they got was
an up-close-and-personal view &#x2013; here&#x2019;s where that hiking and
camping equipment came in &#x2013; of a &#x201C;transect&#x201D; across California,
including a 1,500-mile lap of the Sierra Nevada with side trips
through some of California&#x2019;s most spectacular landscapes.</img></p>
<p>Their route took them through the Central Valley, Sequoia
National Forest, the Kern Canyon, the Mojave Desert, Owens Valley,
Whitney Portal, Death Valley National Park, Mono Lake, Inyo
National Forest, Calaveras Big Trees, and several federally
designated wilderness areas.</p>
<p>They spent 14 nights in tents at campgrounds, a county
educational facility and at primitive sites on federal land.</p>
<p>They were looking at both the obvious and subtle connections
among water, land and living things.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They studied plants, birds, mammals, invertebrates, weather,
history, Native Americans, geography, geology, water, cultural
diversity, art . . . you name it,&#x201D; Dr. Watson said. &quot;A lot of the
learning originated with the students themselves, with each student
giving&#xA0;a field presentation to their peers on a topic of their
choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Connecting all of this was a fabric provided by the instructors
on the form and function of landscapes, how they came to be, how
they are currently managed and how past and present decisions
impact them.</p>

how to remain studious in challenging physical situations, and how
to be a member of a large team at very close quarters,&#x201D; Dr. Watson
said.</img></p>
