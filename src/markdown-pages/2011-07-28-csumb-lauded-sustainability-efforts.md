<p>CSU Monterey Bay walked away with two awards for being &#x201C;green&#x201D;
at the 2011 Higher Education Sustainability Conference.<br>
<br>
Now in its 10th year, the conference &#x2013; held July 10-13 at Cal State
Long Beach &#x2013; is the only one of its kind in the state that brings
together the California State University, the University of
California and the California Community Colleges as well as private
colleges and universities as both organizers and attendees.</br></br></p>

<p>Mike Lerch, CSUMB&#x2019;s associate director of facility services and
operations, accepted the award for best practices in the energy
retrofit category. CSUMB modified the operation of the Tanimura
&amp; Antle library to reduce the amount of time air conditioning
is required. That resulted in an energy savings of approximately 20
percent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a great project because it exemplifies basic principles
in thermodynamics and control theory and required no physical
modifications to equipment,&#x201D; Lerch said, &#x201C;only reprogramming of
computer sequences.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The university was also honored in a category that was added
this year &#x2013;campus-community partnerships.It honors projects that
extend beyond campus boundaries and into the surrounding
communities for opportunities and partnerships around
sustainability efforts.<br>
<br>
CSUMB was recognized for the Chinatown Renewal Project in Salinas.
Professor Dan Fernandez accepted the award. While the focus of the
Chinatown project has been on neighborhood revitalization,
sustainability has been a consistent theme. Among those projects: a
community garden where organic food is grown; workshops on natural
building techniques; a composting enterprise; a
solar-energy-generating gazebo; and a vermiculture
micro-enterprise.</br></br></p>
<p>The conference is a system-wide exchange, aimed at fostering
collaboration among campuses, governments, businesses and
non-profit agencies. It enables staff, faculty and students to
showcase best practices for sustainability, from curriculum to
campus operations. More than 1,100 people attended.</p>
<p>Rebecca Kersnar, a lecturer in the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy, and Megan Tolbert, the university&#x2019;s
transportation planner, represented CSUMB along with Lerch and
Fernandez.</p>
