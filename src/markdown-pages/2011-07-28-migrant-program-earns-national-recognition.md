<p>CSU Monterey Bay has been honored as among the best campuses in
the country at helping migrant students succeed in college.</p>
<p><img alt="CAMP logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/camp_image.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:331px">The university&#x2019;s
College Assistance Migrant Program, a federally funded project
designed to help students from migrant farm worker families pursue
higher education, has been named one of the top 10 at helping them
complete the first year of university studies.</img></p>
<p>In 2009-10, 98 percent of CAMP students &#x2013; 64 of 65 &#x2013;
successfully completed the academic year. Only five schools in the
country had a higher success rate. And of those 65 participants, 58
enrolled for their sophomore years, beating the national target in
that category by four percentage points.</p>
<p>When efficiency and effectiveness were considered, CSUMB ranked
among the top three schools nationwide in the dollar amount spent
to provide services.</p>
<p>The students in CSUMB&#x2019;s program come from Monterey, Santa Cruz,
San Benito and Santa Clara counties.</p>
<p>CAMP has been around since 1972 and has helped over 20,000
students accomplish their goals. The program offers pre-college
transition and first-year support services to help students develop
the skills needed to stay in school and graduate.</p>
<p>Services include help with admissions, financial aid and other
university services, parent orientations, high school and community
outreach events, and summer orientation programs.</p>
<p>Carrie Gonzales-Lujan, coordinator of the CAMP program at CSUMB,
attended the annual U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s Office of
Migrant Education annual directors meeting in Alexandria, Va., in
mid-July. She brought news of the university&#x2019;s national ranking
with her when she returned to campus.</p>
<p>&quot;The directors meeting is a great opportunity for all CAMP
projects to meet directly with the Office Of Migrant Education
directors and staff,&quot; Gonzales-Lujan said. &quot;It allows us to ask
direct &apos;how to&apos; questions about services and eligibility and to
look at best practices.</p>
<p>&quot;The first year I attended was 2008. When I saw the Top 10 list
I said to myself, &apos;CSUMB CAMP will be on that list one day.&apos; And we
made it in the third year. It is exciting to see our program
succeed tremendously in such a short time.&quot;&#xA0;<br>
