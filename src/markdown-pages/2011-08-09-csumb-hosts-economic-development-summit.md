<h3>Learn how to build momentum with lean resources</h3>
<p>City managers, elected officials and professionals who serve the
business community are invited to learn how they can leverage
existing opportunities and pool resources to everyone&#x2019;s benefit
when CSU Monterey Bay hosts the Collaborative Economic Development
Summit on Aug. 17.</p>
<p>The event is part of a statewide series to highlight how
collaborative efforts can generate economic growth and business
development and is sponsored by the Small Business Development
Center at CSU Monterey Bay and the Central Coast SBDC.<br>
<br>
The day will start with a simulcast feed from Fresno, which
features a discussion of economic successes. Nancy Lublin, founder
of Dress for Success and CEO of DoSomething.org, will be the
featured speaker. Her topic: how economic development professionals
can leverage existing &#x2013; and diminishing &#x2013; resources by working
together.<br>
<br>
A panel discussion with representatives from the Governor&#x2019;s Office
of Economic Development, the Central Valley Business Incubator and
Fresno State University will explore best practices to generate
economic growth using minimal resources.<br>
<br>
After the simulcast, a complimentary lunch will be served. During
lunch, Congressman Sam Farr and CSUMB President Dianne Harrison
will speak, followed by a &#x201C;guided matchmaking&#x201D; session intended to
raise awareness of opportunities for leveraging efforts.<br>
<br>
The free event will get under way at 8:30 a.m. at the Alumni and
Visitors Center, on the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and
Inter-Garrison Road. Driving directions and a campus map are
