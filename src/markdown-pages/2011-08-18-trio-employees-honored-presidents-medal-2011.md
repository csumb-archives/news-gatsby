Harrison welcomed the campus community back for the fall semester,
delivered her annual State of the University address, and then
introduced the President&#x2019;s Medal recipients.</img></p>
<p>Last spring, the university community was invited to make
nominations, and then a committee selected finalists for Dr.
Harrison&#x2019;s consideration.</p>
<p>The nominees represented a cross-section of campus &#x2013; some have a
long history at the university, others joined more recently; some
have direct contact with students, others have an operational
focus.</p>
<p>Miller, web programming specialist in Information Technology,
was the staff recipient of the President&#x2019;s Medal. His colleagues
expressed awe at his ability to solve complex problems, communicate
effectively and assert a natural leadership style that is
heightened by an affable personality.</p>
<p>In the past year, Miller was instrumental in the redesign of the
university&#x2019;s website, including the innovative and cost-effective
use of open-source content-management software; the launch of a new
mobile site; the continued evolution of the MyCSUMB interface; and
online voting tools for the Associated Students election.</p>
<p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe, provost and vice president for academic affairs,
earned the President&#x2019;s Medal for administrators. Her colleagues
expressed their admiration for someone who applies a rare
combination of talents and abilities in dedicated pursuit of
continuous improvement for the university.</p>
<p>Her leadership played a significant role in the university&#x2019;s
progress in many important areas, including the reaffirmation of
the university&#x2019;s accreditation by the Western Association of
Schools and Colleges (WASC); general education reform, retention
and graduation, strategic planning and program review.</p>
<p><img alt="Ilene Feinman" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ilenefinal.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:207px">Dr.
Feinman&#xA0;(at right) was awarded the faculty medal. The quality
described by her nominators was leadership &#x2013; the ability to bring
people together to solve complex problems, find consensus and make
a decision. That leadership includes mentoring &#x2013; to colleagues and
students &#x2013; and is communicated with humility and humor.<br>
<br>
As chair of the Faculty Senate, she delivered on her promise to
play a hands-on role and participate across campus as the voice of
the faculty.</br></br></img></p>
<p>Employee service awards were presented to 73 people who have
been with the university for five years; 10-year pins were awarded
to 28 people; and 37 others were acknowledged for 15 years of
service.</p>
<p>Frances Payne Adler was awarded emeritus status, a process that
involved nomination and approval by faculty members, followed by
administrative approvals.</p>
<p>Adler, who joined the university in 1996, founded the Creative
Writing and Social Action Program. She is a renowned poet.</p>
