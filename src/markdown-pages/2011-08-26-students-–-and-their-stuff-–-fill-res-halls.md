move-in day at CSU Monterey Bay.</img></p>
<p>The parking lots bustled with incoming students and their
parents unloading bags and boxes of clothing, comforters, pillows,
electronics and precious keepsakes from home.</p>
<p>Many of the 845 freshmen and 550 new transfer students &#x2013; some of
whom were separating from their families for the first time &#x2013; spent
the day moving into residence halls that will be their homes for
the next year, meeting their roommates and figuring out how to
arrange the furniture.</p>
<p>They moved into buildings that were refurbished over the summer,
with new paint and carpeting.</p>

weekend, 1,800 students moved onto main campus. The student body
was expected to number about 5,200 when classes started on Aug.
22.</img></p>
<p>Volunteers &#x2013; students and staff members &#x2013; were posted around
campus to help carry things, give directions and answer questions,
telling people where to check in, how to obtain a campus ID card
and where to grab lunch.</p>
<p>The university scheduled a week&#x2019;s worth of activities to help
the new students get acquainted with each other and connect to the
campus. An ice cream social, comedy and music concert, and a
late-night DJ in the Student Center got the week rolling on
Friday.</p>
