<p>As the first black female TV journalist in the West, Belva Davis
helped to change the face and focus of TV news.</p>
<p><img alt="Belva Davis" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/davis_authorphoto_hires1.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:406px">Davis will share
her story at California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World
Theater Sept. 27, as the first featured lecture of the 2011-12
President&#x2019;s Speaker Series. Her talk will be based on her recently
published memoir, &#x201C;Never in My Wildest Dreams: A Black Woman&#x2019;s Life
in Journalism.&#x201D; She&#x2019;ll sign copies of the book after her talk.</img></p>
<p>In the book, she recounts her struggle to break into broadcast
journalism at a time when stories of particular importance to
African Americans and women rarely made mainstream newscasts, when
a San Francisco station manager dismissed her from a job interview
by explaining that he wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;hiring any Negresses.&quot;</p>
<p>But Davis, a young single mother struggling to raise two small
children, refused to be deterred &#x2013; the fact that a racist mob
pummeled her with insults and trash at the 1964 Republican National
Convention only made her more determined to persevere. And
ultimately she did, rising to become one of the most respected and
trusted local journalists in the country.</p>
<p>In a career spanning half a century, Davis has reported many
explosive stories, including the Berkeley student protests, the
birth of the Black Panthers, the Peoples Temple cult that ended in
the mass suicides at Jonestown, the assassinations of San Francisco
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the onset of the
AIDS epidemic, and from Africa, the terrorist attacks that first
put Osama bin Laden on the FBI&#x2019;s Most Wanted List.</p>
<p><img alt="book cover" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/book_cover.jpg" style="float:left; width:203px; height:300px">During her career,
she brought stories of black Americans out of the shadows and into
the light of day. And along the way, she encountered cultural icons
including Malcolm X, Frank Sinatra, James Brown, Nancy Reagan, Huey
Newton, Muhammad Ali, Alex Haley, Fidel Castro, Dianne Feinstein
and Condoleezza Rice.</img></p>
<p>It has been an amazing odyssey for Davis, who was born to a
15-year-old Louisiana laundress during the Great Depression. Raised
in the crowded projects of Oakland, confronted by racism and abuse,
Davis achieved a career beyond her imagination. She has won eight
local Emmys and a number of Lifetime Achievement awards &#x2013; including
honors from the International Women&#x2019;s Media Foundation, the
National Association of Black Journalists, and the Northern
California chapter of the National Association of Television Arts
and Sciences.</p>
<p>Davis continues to host a weekly news roundtable and special
reports at KQED, the San Francisco-based PBS station.</p>
<p>The 7 p.m. lecture is free and open to the public. Reservations
are strongly encouraged and can be made <a href="http://csumb.edu/speakers" rel="nofollow">online</a> or by calling
