<h3>CSUMB scientists recognized for work with NASA to improve water
management in California</h3>
<p>A project to provide useful information to California growers
and water managers has won an award from the Federal Laboratory
Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC).</p>
<p>The consortium helps federal labs link their technologies and
expertise with the marketplace.</p>

award-winning project, senior research scientists at CSU Monterey
Bay &#x2013; Forrest Melton, Lars Pierce, Lee Johnson and Chris Lund &#x2013;
teamed with engineers and scientists from NASA, the California
Department of Water Resources (DWR), growers and other partners to
develop a system for mapping daily irrigation demand throughout the
state.</img></p>
<p>The project &#x2013; officially known as Water Management in
California: Scalable to Regional and National Applications &#x2013; was
named the outstanding partnership in the FLC&#x2019;s Far West Region for
2011.</p>
<p>The system calculates measures of crop conditions from satellite
data, and also retrieves data from the California Irrigation
Management Information System managed by DWR, as well as surface
sensor networks that measure weather conditions and soil
moisture.</p>
<p>These observations are combined to provide information about
crop growth and irrigation demand to growers and water managers to
help them manage water resources.</p>
<p>The satellite data comes from satellites that are part of the
Landsat program, Earth-observing satellites launched by NASA and
managed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The images they produce have
a resolution of about a quarter of an acre, a scale fine enough to
be useful to growers. The system also uses data from the NASA Terra
and Aqua satellites to improve data reliability, since these
satellites collect data over California on a daily basis, though at
a slightly coarser resolution.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud of our CSUMB-NASA team for what we have
accomplished under this project, as well as the partnerships we
have established with the California Department of Water Resources,
NASA&#x2019;s Marshall Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Lab,
California growers and our partners at Fresno State, the United
States Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey,&#x201D;
Melton said.</p>
<p>Data from the system is intended to provide growers with an
independent estimate of irrigation requirements, and can serve as
another input into decisions about irrigation scheduling and
management.</p>
<p>Studies conducted in California have shown that use of this type
of data can lead to increases in crop yields and reductions in
total applied irrigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Our primary goal is to provide new information to growers to
help them get the most out of the water available for irrigation,&quot;
Melton said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also exploring ways that we can use this information to
support water managers in improving the delivery of water to
growers around the state.&quot;</p>
<p>Through the project, CSUMB scientists have been working with the
Western Growers Association and growers around the state to deploy
a sensor network in fields, and to jointly evaluate the
satellite-derived estimates of irrigation demand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It has the potential to be very helpful and to provide more
precise information for growers,&#x201D; said Sonia Salas, science and
technology manager for Western Growers. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the beauty of
it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Feedback from users is critical to refine data,&#x201D; Salas added.
&#x201C;Currently, feedback from participants in pilot tests is being
gathered, analyzed and considered to provide a valuable and
user-friendly tool to growers.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Other components of the overall project included work to improve
mapping of the winter snow pack and forecasting of snowmelt and
runoff, as well as efforts to improve mapping of rainfall
patterns.</p>
<p>The award will be presented at the FLC&#x2019;s meeting Aug. 31 in
Monterey.</p>
