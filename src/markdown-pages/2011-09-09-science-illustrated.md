<p>Anyone interested in exploring the confluence of art and science
is invited to attend the summer session of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
Science Illustration program.</p>
<p>Classes in marine science illustration and digital science
illustration will be offered in a five-week session starting July
19.</p>
<p><img alt="An example of work done in the Science Illustration program" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/tumblr_lmk80urigj1qgzqeto1_500.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:295px">While this is the
first time summer classes have been offered on the CSUMB campus &#x2013;
where the program moved in the fall of 2009 &#x2013; they were available
when the program was based at UC Santa Cruz.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Classes have been attended by people from the community, high
school students, professional artists, art students who need a
science elective, and elementary school teachers who want to
develop science units for their classes,&#x201D; said program director Ann
Caudle.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also a good way to learn about the program.</p>
<p>&#x201C;People interested in applying to the year-long Science
Illustration program and want to get a taste for what it is have
also taken summer classes,&#x201D; Caudle said. &#x201C;A substantial number of
our former summer students have successfully applied to our regular
graduate program.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The summer classes are geared to a wide range of student levels.
While there is a set curriculum, there is also one-on-one teaching.
The beginner will get plenty of guidance and practical
training.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve seen amazing progress in just a few weeks,&#x201D; Caudle
said.</p>
<p>Professionals or near-professionals can widen their skill sets,
try new approaches and fine-tune their observation skills and the
quality of their illustrations.</p>
<p>The marine science class will explore marine subjects and their
environment, using watercolor and mixed-media techniques. The
digital science class will use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe
Photoshop in conjunction with traditional techniques. The goal is
to make science accessible to everyone. No prior art or science
experience is necessary.</p>

be taught by Amadeo Bachar, an instructor in the regular program.
Bachar is also a freelance artist whose clients include National
Geographic, Scientific American and the California Department of
Fish and Game.</img></p>
