<h3>Student&#x2019;s work helps to publicize discovery</h3>
<p>Researchers in Tibet have uncovered a woolly rhinoceros believed
to be a million years older than the ones that roamed Europe and
Asia in the ice age.<br>

Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Science Illustration program is helping to bring
that discovery to the world.</img></br></br></p>
<p>Julie Naylor, who earned a certificate from the program in 2011,
created an illustration of what the 3.6 million-year-old rhino may
have looked like as one of her internship projects for
paleontologist Xiaoming Wang at the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County.<br>
<br>
The illustration has appeared in the journal Science, The New York
Times, ABC News, the British Broadcasting Corporation&#x2019;s website and
dozens of other print and web publications worldwide.<br>
<br>
Naylor is among a small number of professional artists who make up
the field of science illustrators, people who work at the
confluence of art and science.<br>
<br>
They take on the task of synthesizing complex scientific
information, and then conveying that information in images. In the
process, they play a large role in helping their audiences
understand the science behind the illustration.<br>
<br>
Naylor has been fascinated with nature and drawing since childhood.
&#x201C;Growing up, my weekends were spent in aquariums, museums, at the
zoo or out on hikes,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
At 15, she was certified as a scuba diver and &#x201C;that opened up a
whole new world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
In 2010, she found her way to the Science Illustration program at
CSUMB. &#x201C;It was life-changing for me,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Coming into the program, I had little art training. It was jumping
into the deep end. One thing I really liked about the program is
that we were taught about the practical aspects of the profession.
It gave us an idea of what to expect.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The program moved to CSUMB in 2009 from its original home at UC
Santa Cruz. The one-year graduate-level program is designed for
people who wish to pursue a career in science illustration as well
as for scientists who want to learn to illustrate their own
research.<br>
<br>
After students finish their academic year of course work, they must
complete an internship with a science magazine, museum, aquarium,
university press, zoological or botanical institution, newspaper,
or graphic arts studio.<br>
<br>
Naylor is doing her internship with the Natural History Museum of
L.A. County.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The internship component has been an incredibly valuable
experience,&#x201D; Naylor said. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t recall a year where I&#x2019;ve learned
as much as I did this year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;I would absolutely recommend this program to others.&#x201D;<br>
