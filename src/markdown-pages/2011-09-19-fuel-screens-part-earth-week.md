premise is simple enough &#x2013; we are too reliant on oil &#x2013; its
ramifications (economic, environmental and political) are
enormous.</img></p>
<p>The film is a highly critical, in-depth, personal journey that
examines a host of energy answers to America&apos;s oil addiction, as
well as offering a critique of the U.S. auto and petroleum
industries&apos; role in resisting change.</p>
<p>Tickets are $10, or $5 for people willing to sign an Earth Day
pledge to make an effort to go green.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Your Earth Day pledge will be signed on magnolia leaves that will
be composted after the event,&#x201D; World Theater Executive Director Joe
Cardinalli said. &#x201C;We hope everyone will sign the pledge.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Tickets can be reserved by calling the World Theater box office at
582-4580 or can be purchased at the door.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Tickell, a first-time director, began the journey resulting in
the film after watching members of his family suffer from
pollution-related cancers as a result of living near petroleum
refineries in Louisiana. In 1997, he set out on the road with a
biodiesel powered &quot;Veggie Van&quot; and a video camera and began filming
what would eventually become known as &#x201C;Fuel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to make a film about the serious challenges we face
and ultimately about the power of every individual to make a
difference,&quot; Tickell said. He routinely travels to screen the film
using biodiesel vehicles. His goal, Tickell said, is to &quot;green the
vote&quot; of America by getting everyday people, along with elected
officials and energy companies, to support a 10-year plan that will
transition America to renewable energy.</p>
<p>Harrell Tickell is a veteran producer and musician who
specializes in youth activism, education and the environment. She
co-directs The Veggie Van Organization, a national nonprofit
dedicated to education about sustainable energy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fuel&#x201D; has won numerous awards since its release, including the
audience award for best documentary at the 2008 Sundance Film
Festival.</p>
<p>New York Times reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis called the film
&quot;sweeping and exhilarating . . . Thanks to an informative, buoyant
tone and the director&apos;s own restless intelligence, the film
preaches to the unconverted with passion, energy and graphics so
clear that they would make Al Gore weep all over his
PowerPoint.&quot;</p>
<p>Other reviewers have said:</p>
<p>&quot;IMPRESSIVELY COMPREHENSIVE&quot; . . . &quot;Fuel&quot; is a vital, superbly
assembled documentary that presents an insightful overview of
America&apos;s troubled relationship with oil and how alternative and
sustainable energies can reduce our country&apos;s &#x2013; and the world&apos;s &#x2013;
addictive dependence on fossil fuels.&quot;<br>
&#x2013; Gary Goldstein, Los Angeles Times</br></p>
<p>&quot;SWEEPING AND EXHILARATING&quot; . . . Tickell&apos;s passionate film goes
beyond great storytelling; it rings out like a bell that stirs
consciousness and makes individual action suddenly seem
consequential.<br>
&#x2013; Caroline Libresco, The Sundance Institute</br></p>
<p>&quot;THE UNOFFICIAL SEQUEL TO AL GORE&apos;S &apos;AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH&apos; &quot; .
. . Tickell gets points for intellectual honesty for directly
addressing critics who are concerned that increased use of biofuels
will impact the global food supply, possibly pricing poor countries
out of the market for such staples as corn. He doesn&apos;t dismiss the
argument but offers some next generation technological solutions,
from algae farms in the desert to &quot;vertical farms&quot; in the
cities.<br>
