<p>A pair of newly awarded grants from the U.S. Department of
Education will help CSU Monterey Bay prepare students for graduate
school and careers in science, technology, engineering, and math &#x2013;
referred to as the STEM subjects.</p>
<p>The grants total $5.6 million and will be distributed over five
years by the Department of Education&#x2019;s Hispanic Serving Institution
program. They will support the academic program and undergraduate
research at CSU Monterey Bay and a partnership with Hartnell
College.</p>
<p>The university will use the grant funds to enhance its
curriculum by adding 17 new courses &#x2013; and buying the equipment
necessary for those classes &#x2013; and updating nine existing courses in
biology, marine science, computer science, chemistry and
statistics.<br>
<br>
The grant will also expand the university&apos;s commitment to
undergraduate research by funding research and training
opportunities; providing money to pay upper division students to
assist in lower division science courses; and providing tutoring
and other academic services.</br></br></p>
<p>Of the total amount of the award, $1.27 million is part of a
collaborative grant led by Hartnell to develop a community
college-to-university success program which will streamline the
transfer process to STEM majors.<br>
<br>
&quot;These are significant and transformative projects that will have a
lasting impact on our students, our campus, and our region &#x2013;
putting the Central Coast and the Salinas Valley at the forefront
of producing California&#x2019;s science, math, and technology workforce,&#x201D;
President Dianne Harrison said.</br></br></p>
<p>The grants will take the university&apos;s new and growing science
majors to a new level of innovation, said Dr. Bill Head, director
of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center at CSUMB.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will create peer support and tutoring services that will boost
student success rates in science, math, and computer courses,&quot; Head
said. &quot;It will place state-of-the-art equipment in our new science
classrooms. And it will take our students beyond the classroom and
into the field to conduct real-world, hands-on research.&#x201D;<br>
