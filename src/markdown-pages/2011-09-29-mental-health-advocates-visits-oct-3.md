<p>Jamie Tworkowski didn&#x2019;t expect to start an internationally known
organization. He didn&#x2019;t do it for money, praise or fame.</p>
<p>His motivation was simple &#x2013; he started a suicide prevention
group to help a friend.</p>
<p><img alt="Jamie Tworkowski" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/twloha-founder-jamie-tworkowski.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:450px">The founder of To
Write Love on Her Arms &#x2013; a global movement dedicated to presenting
hope and finding help for those who suffer from depression,
addiction, self-injury and suicidal tendencies &#x2013; will speak Oct. 3
at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater. Doors will open at 7 p.m., the
program will start at 7:30.</img></p>
<p>Sharing the stage with a special guest musician, he will lead a
conversation about issues that millions live with but few talk
about.</p>
<p>&quot;To Write Love on Her Arms&quot; is the title of a story Tworkowski
wrote in 2006. It was the true story of five days he spent with a
friend, Renee, who was denied entry into a drug treatment center in
Orlando, Fla. As a way to pay for her treatment, Tworkowski posted
a blog on Myspace and began selling T-shirts.</p>
<p>Tworkowski created the Florida-based nonprofit organization and
made it his life&apos;s work after he learned the sobering statistics
that two of three people with depression do not get help, and that
the third leading cause of death among 18- to 24-year-olds is
suicide.</p>
<p>Sparked by the support of bands including Switchfoot, Anberlin
and Paramore, TWLOHA T-shirts quickly became a phenomenon within
the music world and the group&apos;s message spread from venue to venue
all over the world. The organization now has the largest online
audience of any nonprofit on Myspace and Facebook, where it is
&quot;liked&quot; by more than 1.2 million people.<br>
<br>
TWLOHA encourages, informs and invests directly in treatment and
recovery organizations, having donated more than $850,000 to date.
The organization has seen thousands taking first steps toward
getting help, and others learning to help their friends or have
honest conversations for the first time.<br>
<br>
Tworkowski shares his vision of hope with a simple message: &quot;You
are not alone and this is not the end of your story.&quot;</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>NBC Nightly News, CBS Sunday Morning, CNN, MTV, Rolling Stone
and SPIN Magazine have interviewed him. He speaks frequently,
bringing a message of hope and community to audiences at colleges
and concerts throughout the United States, Australia and the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;Renee,&quot; a film based on the life story of the young woman who
inspired TWLOHA, is set for release next year.</p>
<p>Tickets are free for CSUMB students and $10 for the public at
the door.</p>
<p>Associated Students, the Personal Growth and Counseling Center
and the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development
sponsor the program. It is presented as part of CSUMB&#x2019;s celebration
of Mental Health Awareness Week.<br>
