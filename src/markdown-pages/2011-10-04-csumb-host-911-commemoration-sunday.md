planned by organizations across campus, included an 8 a.m.
Gathering of Remembrance and Service, volunteer opportunities
throughout the day, and a town hall meeting in the evening.</img></p>
<p>The college Republican and Democratic clubs set up a display of
2,819 flags on the campus quad, representing those who died in the
terrorist attacks. The flags remained on display for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The 8 a.m. event was held at the flagpole on the campus quad.
Led by the CSUMB chaplains Jon Perez and Clark Brown, the service
honored the work of those in public safety and veterans and
included reflections from CSUMB students, Service Learning faculty
and staff members and President Dianne Harrison. It ended at
approximately 8:45 with a send-off to public service.</p>

<p>After a day of memorials, service and programs, a town hall was
held from 6:30 to 8 p.m. in the Student Center, providing an
opportunity for the community to come back together and reflect.
Sponsored by the CSUMB Social Justice Coalition, the event included
a discussion and ended with a candlelight vigil.</p>
