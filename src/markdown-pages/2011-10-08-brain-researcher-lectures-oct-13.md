Dr. Michael Merzenich studies neuroplasticity &#x2013; the brain&apos;s
powerful ability to change itself and adapt &#x2013; and investigates ways
plasticity might be used to heal injured brains and enhance the
skills in healthy ones.</br></p>
<p>He will talk about his work at California State University,
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on Oct. 13, as the President&#x2019;s Speaker
Series continues.</p>

studied how brains develop for more than three decades. His
research has shown that the brain retains its ability to alter
itself well into adulthood &#x2013; suggesting that brains with injuries
or disease might be able to recover function, even later in life.
He has also explored the way the senses are mapped in regions of
the brain and the way sensations teach the brain to recognize new
patterns.</img></p>
<p>Merzenich is trying to bring the powerful plasticity of the
brain into practical use through technologies and methods that
harness it to improve learning. He founded Scientific Learning
Corporation, which markets and distributes educational software for
children based on models of brain plasticity. He is co-founder and
chief science officer of Posit Science, which creates &quot;brain
training&quot; software also based on his research.</p>
<p>That software, sold commercially under the names Brain Fitness
Program and InSight, is supposed to strengthen memory, attention,
language skills and visual-spatial abilities in aging adults. &#x201C;This
is the beginning of a revolution,&#x201D; Merzrnich told The New York
Times in June.</p>
<p>Studies have shown improvement in those who use the software.
Some critics, however, are not convinced that the gains translate
into long-term benefits that can be generalized to daily challenges
such as remembering where the car is parked.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Merzenich was on the team that invented the
cochlear implant to restore hearing for the severely deaf.</p>
<p>Merzenich is professor emeritus of neuroscience at the
University of California, San Francisco. He has published more than
200 articles, received numerous awards and prizes and holds more
than 50 patents. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences
in 1999 and is a member of the Institute of Medicine.</p>
