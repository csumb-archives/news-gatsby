Mexican film about ancient game to be screened Oct. 12</br></br></img></h3>
<p>Each Sunday during the fall and winter months, while many
Americans watch football on television, another sports tradition is
taking place in some areas of Mexico. That game, ulama, involves
five-man teams of athletes volleying rubber balls off their hips
across dirt playing fields. It has been played throughout
Mesoamerica for thousands of years. Excavations have found ceramic
figurines and ball courts from the fourth century A.D.</p>
<p>Luckily for modern-day players, the stakes are no longer as high
as they were in Aztec times. The winners then were rewarded with a
prime spot on the sacrificial altar, on their way to an afterlife
with the gods; the losers were banished.</p>
<p>The sport &#x2013; one of the best links between the pre-Hispanic world
and modern Mexico &#x2013; gained worldwide attention when the documentary
film &#x201C;Ulama: el juego de la vida y la muerte&#x201D; (Ulama: the Mayan
ballgame of life and death) was first shown in 1984.</p>

screened at California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World
Theater at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 12. Director Roberto Roch&#xED;n will be on
hand to discuss his film and answer questions from the audience.
The program will be hosted by CSU Monterey Bay founding faculty
member Luis Valdez.</img></p>
<p>The discussion will be held in English; the film&#x2019;s dialogue is
in Spanish with English subtitles.</p>
<p>Far more than a simple expos&#xE9; on an ancient sport, Roch&#xED;n&#x2019;s
documentary is a lyrical and beautifully shot work of art,
balancing its study of ancient ritual with images of the game in
modern play, celebrated by indigenous populations of Mexico and
Central America.</p>
<p>It earned five Ariel Awards from the Mexican Motion Picture
Academy of Arts and Sciences: best film debut; best film; best
music; best editing; and best cinematography. It&#x2019;s now considered a
classic of Mexican documentary films.</p>
<p>After the discussion, Roch&#xED;n will sign copies of his book about
ulama.</p>
<p>The event is free, but a parking permit must be purchased from a
machine on the lot next to the theater.</p>
<p>The screening is sponsored by a variety of campus programs and
academic departments, Fremont Gallery and El Teatro Campesino.</p>
