<p>Before students began their freshman year at CSU Monterey Bay
this fall, the university expected them to complete a homework
assignment on a subject they won&apos;t get class credit for &#x2013;
alcohol.</p>
<p><img alt="beer bottle" height="80" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/beer%20bottle.jpg" style="float:right" width="128">During the summer, incoming
students were required to spend about three hours completing a
mandatory web-based course that deals with a variety of
alcohol-related topics.</img></p>
<p>The course, called AlcoholEdu, is in its second year at CSUMB,
but has been used for a decade at hundreds of campuses. Outside the
Classroom, the Massachusetts company that developed it, says that
about 36 percent of all freshmen at American four-year colleges and
universities will take the course this year.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, San Francisco State, Chico State
and CSU Channel Islands are among the California schools that have
adopted the program.</p>
<p>Indications are it has been successful at CSUMB.</p>
<p>The goal is to ensure that students have a base of information
before they arrive on campus &#x2013; when they are exposed to alcohol and
behavior patterns get formed.</p>
<p>Students begin the program by taking a survey that measures
their attitudes about, and knowledge of, alcohol. After completing
the survey, the program walks them through a variety of topics
including how alcohol impacts brain development and learning,
factors that affect blood alcohol content and laws about
alcohol.</p>
<p>The course is personalized to each student based on past
drinking patterns, gender and perceptions about alcohol. They can
log in and out of the program whenever they want and finish the
course at their convenience.</p>
<p>Six weeks into the semester, students take the second part of
the course. The interval allows them to digest what they have
learned.</p>
<p>&quot;Chico State saw a drop in alcohol-related cases referred to
Judicial Affairs after AlcoholEdu was introduced,&quot; Andy
Klingelhoefer, CSUMB&apos;s judicial affairs officer, said in 2010 when
the program was first introduced.</p>
<p><img alt="red cups" height="84" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/red%20cups.jpg" style="float:left" width="149">He noted that CSUMB also saw a
drop in alcohol-related cases last spring, and so far this year,
he&apos;s seen an even bigger drop.</img></p>
<p>&quot;The educational part of it gets students thinking about the
issue by the time they arrive on campus,&quot; Klingelhoefer&#xA0;said.
&quot;Last year, 64 percent of freshmen said they didn&apos;t drink. That
surprised other students. They assume their peers are drinking more
than they really are. It&apos;s valuable information for them,&quot; he
said.</p>
<p>Among last year&apos;s CSUMB freshmen, 23 percent indicated they were
high-risk drinkers compared to 27 percent nationally.</p>
<p>After completing AlcoholEdu, students reported increases in
positive behavior intentions. Among high-risk drinkers who did not
see a need to change their drinking behavior before the course, 36
percent indicated a readiness to change their drinking after
completing it.</p>
<p>Top reasons the students cite for not drinking: going to drive
(71 percent); don&apos;t have to drink to have a good time (62 percent);
don&apos;t want to lose control (51 percent).</p>
<p>Students who fail to complete the course before arrival will get
reminder notices; those who still don&apos;t comply will not be allowed
to register for the spring semester until they do.</p>
<p>As another way to address the issue, CSUMB is scheduling more
alcohol-free activities, Klingelhoefer said.</p>
<p>All events put on by the Associated Students, the Otter Student
Union, clubs and organizations are alcohol free. The Black Box
Cabaret hosted 68 events last year attended by more than 10,000
students where no alcohol was available.</p>
<p>College drinking isn&apos;t new. It has been a sore point in American
college history as far back as the days of Thomas Jefferson, who
complained about it at the University of Virginia, Henry Wechsler,
director of the College Alcohol Study at the Harvard School of
Public Health, told the San Francisco Chronicle.</p>
