consumption of alcohol.</img></p>

<p>NCAAW has grown to become the largest single event in all of
academia because students take ownership in designing and
implementing the observance for their campus communities. The week
also provides campuses the opportunity to showcase healthy
lifestyles free from the abuse or illegal use of alcohol and to
combat negative stereotypes associated with college drinking
behavior.<br>
&quot;NCAAW is a focused event for campuses to address alcohol abuse and
impaired driving prevention efforts,&quot; said Janet Cox, head of the
BACCHUS Network, a national nonprofit organization that supports
student health and safety through peer education.</br></p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, campuses need to educate students about excessive
drinking and consequences that can occur on personal, academic and
campus levels. All college and university offices need to empower
students to take responsibility for their own decisions and the
campus environment when it comes to alcohol,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Participation in NCAAW helps students and college
administrators work together to increase awareness and strengthen
year-round prevention efforts. We have to engage and empower
students in efforts to take care of themselves and each other,&quot; Cox
said.</p>
<p>University faculty and staff also play a vital role in working
with students to educate them about alcohol.</p>
<p>&#x201C;NCAAW allows us to show our students here at CSUMB &#x2013;
particularly new students &#x2013; that most of their peers are not
abusing alcohol and most are making healthy and safe decisions,&#x201D;
said Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist
with CSUMB&#x2019;s Health &amp; Wellness Services.</p>
<p>The 2011 NCAAW &#x201C;Raise Your Voice! You Can Save a Life!&#x201D; campaign
theme, developed by the BACCHUS Network, contains a message of
student empowerment through decision-making that is safe and
healthy. It encourages students to take care of friends, to call
for help if concerned about alcohol poisoning, and to take
proactive steps to stay safe in social situations where alcohol may
be present.</p>
<p>The messages support personal responsibility and practical
safety tips about avoiding excessive drinking, not driving after
drinking, and not riding with a driver who has been drinking.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These are great messages for students because they focus on
providing them with education and skill development. They allow
students to make their own informed choices,&#x201D; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>NCAAW at CSUMB is a collaborative effort of the Personal Growth
&amp; Counseling Center, the POWER Peer Education Program, Student
Housing &amp; Residential Life, the Residential Housing
Association, Athletics, the Student Athlete Advisory Council,
Student Activities &amp; Leadership Development, the Office of
Judicial Affairs &amp; Community Standards, University Police
Department, the Campus Health Center, Academic &amp; Centralized
Scheduling, Sigma Theta Psi Sorority, the Multicultural Greek
Council, Otter Student Union, Sun Street Recovery Centers and the
California Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>NCAAW isn&#x2019;t the only way CSUMB works to educate students about
drinking.</p>
<p>For the last two years, a program called AlcoholEdu has been
required for all freshmen. During the summer before they start
classes at CSUMB, freshmen must complete a web-based course that
deals with a variety of alcohol-related topics. The goal is to
ensure that students have a base of information before they arrive
on campus &#x2013; when they are exposed to alcohol and behavior patterns
get formed.</p>
