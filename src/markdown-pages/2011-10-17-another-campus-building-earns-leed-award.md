<p>The Dining Commons at CSU Monterey Bay is the university&apos;s
second project to earn the U.S. Green Building Council&apos;s
prestigious Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
silver certification.</p>

took place in 2009 and was finished on a tight schedule &#x2013; 112 days
between spring break and the start of the fall semester. It was the
first significant improvement to the building since the campus
opened in 1995.</img></p>
<p>The work focused on modernization through maximizing spaces,
using natural and energy-efficient lighting and design elements
geared to visual appeal and convenience.</p>
<p>The renovation of the 11,000-square-foot building cost $3.45
million. A new entryway was installed, the roof was replaced,
structural steel framing was added, new serving-line areas were
installed,&#xA0;<img alt="Interior shot of the Dining Commons" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/dc-4.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:200px">serpentine quarry
tile was added throughout the serving area, a conveyor dishwashing
system was installed along with new heating and ventilation
systems, and custom booth and banquette seating were added to
create the look and feel of a restaurant.</img></p>
<p>In the LEED certification process, points are awarded within
each of six environmental categories: Sustainable Sites, Water
Efficiency, Energy &amp; Atmosphere, Materials &amp; Resources,
Indoor Environmental Quality, and Innovation in Design.</p>
<p>The Dining Commons scored well in the categories of water
efficiency, materials and indoor quality. The renovated building
uses 50 percent less water. Points were also awarded for reusing an
existing building and saving as much of the interior non-structural
surfaces as possible. When new materials were required, they were
made from recycled content and locally sourced.</p>
<p>And, over 75 percent of the demolition debris was recycled and
kept out of landfills.</p>
<p>The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library, which opened
in December 2008, was the first campus building to be awarded LEED
silver certification.<br>
