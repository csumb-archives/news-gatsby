presentations, both free and open to the public, at noon and again
at 2 p.m. Both will be held in the TAT studio on Sixth Avenue at A
Street.<br>
<br>
Wilkerson is a contemporary practitioner of agit-prop &#x201C;third
cinema&#x201D; media activism. His best-known work is the experimental
documentary &#x201C;An Injury to One,&#x201D; which premiered at the Sundance
Film Festival in 2003.</br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>It centers on a significant episode in American labor history,
the murder of Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organizer Frank
Little in Butte, Montana, in August 1917. The film provides the
historical background to the event, the decades-long exploitation
of the region and its workers by the Anaconda Copper Mining
Company.<br>
<br>
Wilkerson&#x2019;s film also examines the present state of Butte, a
decayed industrial city of 32,000 people, blighted by the largest
body of contaminated water in the United States, the Berkeley Pit.
This is the legacy of Anaconda, which abandoned the town decades
ago. The company reportedly had extracted $25 billion worth of
copper by that time.<br>
<br>
His other films include &quot;Accelerated Underdevelopment&quot; (on the
Cuban filmmaker Santiago Alvarez) and &quot;Who Killed Cock
Robin?&quot;<br>
<br>
In 2009, he presented the first ever performance art at Sundance
with &quot;Proving Ground,&quot; a live multi-media presentation chronicling
the history of U.S. aerial bombings.<br>
<br>
In addition to Sundance, his work has screened at scores of
festivals worldwide, including Toronto, Rotterdam, Marseille,
Buenos Aires International Independent Film Festival, Hot Docs,
Vienna International Film Festival and Yamagata International
Documentary Film Festival.<br>
<br>
Among his awards are the Documentary Prize from the New York
Underground Film Festival, the Innovation Award at the Chicago
International Documentary Film Festival and the Narrative Integrity
Award at the Ann Arbor Film Festival.<br>
<br>
He&#x2019;s also a co-founder of the micro-distributor Extreme Low
Frequency, which releases little-seen works of radical cinema, both
classic and contemporary.<br>

Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
While the event is free, visitors will have to purchase a parking
pass from machines located on the parking lots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
