<p>For the third consecutive year, CSU Monterey Bay has been named
a &#x201C;military-friendly school&#x201D; by G.I. Jobs magazine.</p>
<p>The list honors the top 20 percent of colleges and universities
that are doing the most to embrace America&#x2019;s military members and
veterans as students, according to the magazine&#x2019;s publisher, Rich
McCormack.</p>
<p>The magazine polled more than 8,000 schools nationwide in
determining the results, examining criteria such as efforts to
recruit and retain military and veteran students.</p>
<p>Among CSUMB&#x2019;s military-friendly practices are web pages with
information specifically for veterans; a designated veterans
services liaison and campus support team to help veterans make the
transition from active duty service to successful educational
pursuits; and a Student Veterans Organization that launched this
fall.<br>
<br>
CSUMB has seen an increase in the number of queries and
applications from veterans since the webpages went up and the
veterans&apos; contact was put in place. The number of veterans
contacting the university for pre-admission counseling has
increased, with queries coming from veterans and active-duty
service members across the U.S. and around the world.<br>
<br>
This semester, CSUMB has 64 student receiving educational benefits
from the Veterans Administration (GI Bill) to support their
educational goals; 54 of them are receiving the new Post 9/11 GI
Bill benefit, which helps pay tuition/fee costs as well as offering
a monthly housing stipend and a book allowance during the
semester.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Another 23 students are eligible for the Federal VA Dependents
Educational Assistance program (DEA) as dependents of deceased or
disabled veterans. The DEA program offers a monthly stipend to
offset living expenses during the semester.<br>
<br>
The State of California also offers a state tuition waiver to
dependents of deceased or disabled veterans through the California
Department of Veterans Affairs. There are 87 students at CSUMB this
semester who are using this program.</br></br></p>
