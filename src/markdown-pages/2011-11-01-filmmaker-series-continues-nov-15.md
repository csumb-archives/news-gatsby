<h3>Experimental film tells tale of devotion, grief</h3>
<p>No matter what you call it &#x2013; experimental, off-beat, arty,
eccentric &#x2013; Brent Green&#x2019;s film &#x201C;Gravity Was Everywhere Back Then&#x201D;
has attracted a growing fan base since its debut in 2010. Locals
will have the opportunity to see the film and hear from the
director on Nov. 15 when the visiting artist series presented by
the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department (TAT) at CSU
Monterey Bay and the Monterey Bay Film Society continues.</p>
<p>Green and Donna K., who co-wrote the film and acts in it, will
make two presentations, both free and open to the public, at noon
and again at 7 p.m. Both will be held in the TAT studio on Sixth
Avenue at A Street.</p>

on the true story of a Kentucky hardware clerk, Leonard Wood, who
obsessively built additions onto his house after his wife, Mary,
was diagnosed with cancer. His desire was to construct a &#x201C;healing
machine&#x201D; that would save her. She died, but in his grief he
continued to build for 15 years.<br>
<br>
Shot entirely on the full-scale town Green built in his back yard,
he combines animation, stop-motion and live-action in an ethereal
opus to lovers and tinkerers everywhere.</br></br></img></p>
<p>Green is a self-taught animated filmmaker and artist who lives
and works in the Appalachian hills of Pennsylvania. His films have
been shown at the Sundance Film Festival, New York&#x2019;s Museum of
Modern Art, the Getty Center, the Warhol Museum and other museums
and festivals around the world.</p>
<p>Said Mike Plante, programmer at Sundance: &#x201C;The do-it-yourself
ethics that Brent Green and Donna K. use to make films are
inspiring and a great thing to show to students of any art form.
They didn&#x2019;t just make a film, they invented a way to make it, with
sets, a type of storytelling and personal style. The film&#x2019;s success
is just as encouraging.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at
csumb.edu/map. While the event is free, visitors will have to
purchase a parking pass from machines located on the parking
lots.</p>
