<p>With a computer keystroke on July 29, President Dianne Harrison
filed a report that earned CSU Monterey Bay a gold rating from the
nation&#x2019;s leading advocacy group for sustainability in higher
education. The university is one of only 18 institutions to receive
that distinction.</p>
<p>CSUMB becomes the first campus in the California State
University system and the second public university in California to
qualify for the gold rating from the Association for the
Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.</p>

in the organization&apos;s STARS program, signifies that the university
is doing an outstanding job of going &#x201C;green&#x201D; in areas ranging from
curriculum and construction to conservation of resources.<br>
<br>
STARS &#x2013; which stands for Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and
Rating System &#x2013; measures and encourages sustainability in education
and research, operations, and planning, administration and
engagement.</br></br></img></p>
<p>The rating is the result of a thorough, yearlong self-evaluation
process that involved faculty, staff and students. STARS is a
widely used sustainability self-assessment tool that helps colleges
evaluate and publicly report how they&#x2019;re doing, where they can
improve, what peers are doing and mark progress over time.</p>
<p>Examples of CSUMB&#x2019;s sustainable practices:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Education and research: All students are required to take service
learning courses that address sustainability; 35 percent of
tenure-track faculty members are conducting research relating to
sustainability.<br>
&#x2022; Waste reduction: 90 percent of construction and demolition debris
is diverted from landfills.<br>
&#x2022; Water conservation: drought-tolerant landscaping, waterless
urinals<br>
&#x2022; Energy efficiency: reduced energy consumption by more than 25
percent over five years<br>
&#x2022; Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions: All members of the campus
community have access to free public transportation throughout the
region.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;The idea of sustainability is embedded in the curriculum here
at CSUMB,&#x201D; said Kevin Saunders, vice president for administration
and finance. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re educating the region on these issues.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And because it is embedded in the curriculum, &#x201C;Our students &#x2013;
who are our future leaders &#x2013; can move through their lives and
careers with this ethic of sustainability,&#x201D; President Harrison
said.<br>
<br>
In the innovation category, the university earned the maximum four
points for:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; The annual Focus the Region event, a daylong teach-in on
environmental issues<br>
&#xA0;&#x2022; The Chinatown Renewal Project, an effort to help revitalize
a blighted though historically rich neighborhood in Salinas.
Sustainability has been a consistent theme in these efforts, which
include a community garden where organic food is grown; workshops
on natural building techniques; a composting enterprise; a
solar-energy-generating gazebo; and a vermiculture
micro-enterprise.<br>
&#x2022; Planning for and use of electric vehicles<br>
&#x2022; The TRIPwise program, an effort to educate the campus community
about alternate forms of transportation and make them
accessible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>With the evaluation complete, CSUMB will continue to seek
further gains in such areas as energy management, alternative
transportation and waste reduction.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a starting point,&#x201D; President Harrison said. &#x201C;We know
there are many more things we can do.&quot;<br>
