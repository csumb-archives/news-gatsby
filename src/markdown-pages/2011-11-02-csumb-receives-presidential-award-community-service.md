<h2>University is only two-time top honoree in the nation</h2>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received the
Presidential Award as part of the 2010 President&#x2019;s Higher Education
Community Service Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition a
college or university can receive for its commitment to community
service.&#xA0;</p>

President Dianne Harrison (pictured at left in red jacket) received
the award June 8 in New Orleans. Dr. Seth Pollack, director of
CSUMB&apos;s Service Learning Institute, and Dr. Miguel Lopez,
co-founder of the &quot;Increase the Peace&quot; initiative and a faculty
member in Liberal Studies, also attended the awards ceremony.</img></p>
<p>The Corporation for National and Community Service received
applications from more than 850 colleges and universities. Only six
received the Presidential Award.</p>
<p>In 2006, the program&#x2019;s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one
of three recipients of the top award. It has been named to the
Honor Roll each year since then.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only is service learning woven into our curriculum,&quot;
President Harrison said, &quot;it also is part of our university&apos;s ethos
of engaging with and contributing to our surrounding
communities.&quot;<br>
<br>
CSUMB was honored in the category of summer learning, highlighting
its many programs that work with at-risk youth, providing young
people opportunities to work alongside CSUMB students in
strengthening their college readiness. The award specifically
recognizes CSUMB&#x2019;s Increase the Peace Summer Youth Leadership
Program, which provides literacy, math and art classes for at-risk
students at El Sausal Middle School in Salinas. The program works
to strengthen students&#x2019; sense of pride and cultural identify
through art and literature so they can reject harmful influences
and continue on the path to college.</br></br></p>
<p>Congressman Sam Farr noted that CSUMB is serving as a national
example of community service, grounded in the spirit of helping
others. &#x201C;Demonstrating the best of our values of selflessness and
compassion, I&apos;m certain that this award will undoubtedly help
promote and inspire volunteerism for the next generation of youth
on the Central Coast,&#x201D; Congressman Farr said in a prepared
statement.</p>
<p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of
the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all
students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB&#x2019;s students enroll
in service&#xA0;learning courses contributing more than 84,000
hours of service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations
and government agencies in the tri-county area. And service
learning is an academic department, where issues of service,
diversity, social justice and social responsibility are linked to
the core curriculum.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally
and even internationally,&#x201D; Dr. &#xA0;Pollack said.</p>

university in the country has made as significant a commitment to
developing students&#x2019; capacity for service and social
responsibility.&#x201D;&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;We have a very special program, and it feels great to be
recognized as a national leader.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the Corporation and National and Community Service,
honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors,
including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent
to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the
school&#x2019;s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and
measurable community outcomes as a result of the service.&#xA0;</p>
