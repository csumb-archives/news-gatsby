<h3>Community activist Helen Rucker establishes endowment</h3>
<p>The Fort Ord Alumni Association, a division of the California
State University, Monterey Bay Foundation, presented scholarships
to 10 CSUMB students at its annual Scholarship Awards Luncheon at
the Alumni and Visitors Center on campus.</p>
<p>The awards bring to 122 the total number of scholarships &#x2013; all
in the amount of $1,000 &#x2013; given by FOAA since its scholarship
program began in 1997.<br>

this year&#x2019;s event was the announcement of an endowed scholarship
set up by Helen Rucker of Seaside in honor of her late husband,
James, who served at Fort Ord.</img></br></br></p>
<p>Mrs. Rucker, 79, a retired teacher and librarian and longtime
community activist on the Monterey Peninsula, donated $25,000 to
permanently endow a scholarship she has funded annually since
1998.</p>
<p>She encouraged others at the luncheon to support FOAA
scholarships, and she described her own philanthropic giving as an
expression of personal priorities, not personal wealth.</p>
<p>&quot;When people ask me, &apos;How do you do it, Helen?,&apos; I tell them
it&apos;s about how you care to spend your money,&quot; said Mrs. Rucker, who
is also a board trustee for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School
District.</p>
<p>She described how her husband credited the Army for giving him
the chance at an education. He joined the military with a
seventh-grade education, earned a GED while in uniform, then, as a
40-year-old retiree, took advantage of veterans benefits to earn
bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He was dedicated to learning. It&#x2019;s appropriate that a
scholarship be created in his name,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>This year, the Platoon Sergeant James Rucker and Helen B. Rucker
Scholarship was awarded to Denice Vallejo of Salinas.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud to present the James Rucker Scholarship to Denice
because she&#x2019;s a returning student,&#x201D; Mrs. Rucker said. &#x201C;The only
thing I can say to you, Denice, is &#x2018;pass it on.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Vallejo, who grew up at Fort Ord where her father was stationed,
explained that she helped her children and her husband with their
studies. &#x201C;I quizzed them on their homework, I edited their papers,&#x201D;
she said. Then she decided it was time to pursue her own education.
After earning two community college degrees, she came to CSUMB.</p>
<p>Many of the scholarship recipients are first-generation college
students. Some are the children or grandchildren of soldiers who
served at Fort Ord. Several are military veterans.</p>
