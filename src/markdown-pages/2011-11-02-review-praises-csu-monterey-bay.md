signifies that the university remains in good academic standing,
and its students will continue to be eligible for federal financial
aid.<br>
<br>
&quot;The WASC reaffirmation is a major vote of confidence in our
academic programs and our commitment to student success,&quot; President
Harrison said. &quot;The commission said our resources are strongly
aligned with our strategic goals and priorities, and that is
especially important in this challenging economic environment.&quot;</br></br></img></br></p>
<p>&#x2028;As a new institution, CSU Monterey Bay received its initial
WASC accreditation in 2003. The current action is the university&#x2019;s
first re-affirmation of the initial accreditation.<br>
<br>
The re-affirmation process took several years, and included two
site visits from WASC reviewers. For each visit, the campus
prepared extensive reports documenting the work it has done that
pertains to the WASC criteria for accreditation. The first visit,
known as the &#x201C;Capacity and Preparatory Review,&#x201D; took place in
September of 2009. The second WASC visit focused on &#x201C;Educational
Effectiveness,&#x201D; and that occurred in March 2011. The visiting team
then presented its report to the WASC Accrediting Commission, which
rendered its final decision regarding accreditation status this
month.<br>
<br>
Both the visiting team and the commission commended the university
for accomplishments in several key areas. After its March 2011
visit, the WASC visiting team concluded that &#x201C;CSUMB is an active
and dynamic institution that continues to embrace its vision, adapt
to its environment, and plan for the future. Administrators,
faculty and staff are invested in student learning and are
committed to the institutional vision. Student success appears to
be paramount, and decision-making is founded on what is perceived
to be the best for the students.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The visiting team commended the campus for &#x201C;improving processes
that have dramatically affected student retention.&#x201D; The commission
particularly valued the university&#x2019;s &#x201C;dynamism, adaptation, and
planning that have taken place during this comprehensive review.&#x201D;
The commission also highlighted recent work on improving graduation
and retention rates.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;There was real appreciation and commendation by the site visiting
team and the commission regarding CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s progress since
its initial accreditation,&quot; stated WASC President Ralph Wolff. &quot;It
is clear that the entire campus is deeply engaged in its
educational effectiveness efforts and is focused on student
learning.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
