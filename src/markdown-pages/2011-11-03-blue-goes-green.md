<h4>University Police Department gets hybrid vehicle</h4>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Police Department has joined a growing number
of law enforcement agencies parking Toyota Prius hybrids next to
their Crown Victorias as they go green.</p>

international trend &#x2013; dozens of police departments including
Lincoln, Neb., New York City, London and Abu Dhabi have adopted the
fuel-efficient vehicles for various uses.<br>
<br>
Police Chief Earl Lawson was quick to point out that the Prius is
for &#x201C;civilian&#x201D; use. It will be used by parking enforcement officers
and by the community service officers (CSOs) who staff the night
walk program.</br></br></img></p>
<p>&#x201C;We traded in a big gas-guzzling Ford F-150 for the Prius,&#x201D;
Chief Lawson said. &#x201C;We wanted a smaller, more efficient, more
environmentally friendly vehicle.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re interested in acquiring an all-electric vehicle or another
hybrid,&#x201D; he said. Those vehicles aren&#x2019;t suitable for use as patrol
cars, but are perfect for other UPD needs, such as parking
enforcement that involves a lot of stop-and-go driving.<br>
<br>
The vehicle was leased from the state Department of General
Services. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a waiting list for hybrid vehicles,&#x201D; Lawson
said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re lucky to have it.&quot;</br></br></br></br></p>
