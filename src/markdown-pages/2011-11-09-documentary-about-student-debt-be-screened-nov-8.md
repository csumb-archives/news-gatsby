<p>Student loan debt is on the rise, and, because of the lingering
effects of the recession, fewer graduates are getting the kinds of
jobs that allow them to pay back what they borrowed.</p>
<p><img alt="More than 60 percent of graduates of public universities leave school with debt" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/default.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:225px">Members of the
Class of 2009 owed an average of $24,000, up 6 percent from the
year before. National Public Radio reported on Oct. 21 that 66
percent of students now graduate with debt, and some find their
debt influencing major life decisions long after graduation.</img></p>
<p>If students cannot find a job quickly in order to be able to
start paying back their loans, $24,000 can easily balloon to
$100,000 or more.</p>
<p>&quot;Default: The Student Loan Documentary&quot; puts a human face on the
student debt crisis, following several borrowers&#x2019; stories of
struggling with the student lending industry. Because they were
unable to start paying back their loans within nine months of
graduation, their private loan interest rates spiraled upward,
making a once manageable debt insurmountable.</p>
<p>The public is invited to view this 27-minute documentary at CSU
Monterey Bay at 6:30 p.m., Nov. 8, in the Teledramatic Arts and
Technology Building on Sixth Avenue at A Street.</p>
<p>Aurora Meneghello, the documentary&#x2019;s director, will be on
hand.</p>
<p>After the screening, Dr. George Caffentzis, professor of
philosophy at the University of Southern Maine, will talk about
student debt in the context of the economic crisis and the global
student movement.</p>
<p>Amanda Armstrong, a graduate student at UC Berkeley, will
present strategies being used by the growing movement against
student debt, and members of CSU Students for Quality Education
will facilitate a discussion of the issue.<br>

intention from the start was to educate people on student loans:
how they work, what happens when you cannot pay them back, and to
open a dialogue about debt.</img></em><br>

<em>This year, for the first time, the amount of student loans will
surpass the $100 billion mark and the outstanding balance will
exceed $1 trillion. That means the amount of credit card debt and
student debt is about equal.</em><br>

<em>The credit risk falls on young people who will start adult life
deeper in debt, a burden that could place a drag on the economy in
the future.</em><br>
