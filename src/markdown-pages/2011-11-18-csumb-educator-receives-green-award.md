<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Laura Lee Lienk was honored with the GREEN
Educator Award for her work in promoting environmental issues.</p>
<p>Earth Force, a Colorado-based nonprofit dedicated to engaging
young people to be stewards of the environment, and the General
Motors Foundation sponsor the award. It recognizes teachers,
college professors and volunteers who integrate environmental
education into school and community programs. GREEN stands for
Global Rivers Environmental Education Network.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Laura Lee was selected from among thousands of educators to
receive the inaugural GREEN Educator Award,&#x201D; said Kristen Mueller
of Earth Force. &#x201C;She was nominated because she exemplifies the best
of what educators are doing to teach young people to lead efforts
to protect our environment.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Her work, day in and day out, has been an inspiration to all of us
at Earth Force and the GM Foundation,&#x201D; Mueller said.<br>
<br>
At the university, Lienk serves in a variety of roles. She&#x2019;s
co-director of the Watershed Institute, director of the institute&#x2019;s
Return of the Natives restoration education project and coordinator
of Service Learning in Applied Science and Technology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Connecting environmental and social issues through
community-based service learning benefits the environment but also
human communities,&quot; Lienk said.<br>
<br>
As coordinator of Service Learning, she works with faculty members
in biology, math, environmental studies and computer science to
find partner organizations where hundreds of CSUMB students
interact with communities beyond their classrooms each year.<br>
<br>
She is also coordinating a STEM &#x2013; science, technology, engineering
and math &#x2013; academic learning community. Partners in that project
include high school math and biology teachers, Natividad Hospital
Auxiliary, Loaves, Fishes and Computers and the Agricultural and
Land Based Training Association.<br>
<br>
Lienk has been with CSUMB since 1995.<br>

exemplify great GREEN teaching,&#x201D; according to the website
