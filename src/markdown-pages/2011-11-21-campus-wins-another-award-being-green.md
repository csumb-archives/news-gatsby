<p>CSU Monterey Bay has been awarded a 2011 Public-Private
Partnership &#x201C;Green&#x201D; Award by the Monterey County Business Council.
The honor was announced at the annual Monterey Bay Regional
Economic Forum on Oct. 28.<br>
<br>

honored for the solar power generation facility that was completed
on campus in 2010. CSUMB partnered with SunEdison, the nation&#x2019;s
largest solar energy service provider, on the project.<br>
<br>
The 6.4-acre solar panel array &#x2013; consisting of approximately 3,900
panels &#x2013; was installed at ground level on a vacant lot on the east
side of Seventh Avenue, between Col. Durham Street and Butler
Street.<br>
<br>
In addition to financing and building the system, SunEdison will
operate and maintain it over the course of a 20-year contract. The
university purchases the power at a pre-agreed price.<br>
<br>
The system generates almost 2 million kilowatt hours of electricity
per year for CSUMB, enough to meet 16 percent of the university&apos;s
current electricity needs. It reduces carbon dioxide emissions
associated with electricity consumption by 713 metric tons per
year, equivalent to the amount generated by 92 vehicles.<br>
<br>
This is the third public-private partnership to earn the university
an award from the business council. In 2008, CSUMB and PG&amp;E
were honored for the Energy Efficiency Partnership that resulted in
energy savings in numerous campus building and in 2009 an award was
received for innovative outdoor lighting efficiency
improvements.<br>
