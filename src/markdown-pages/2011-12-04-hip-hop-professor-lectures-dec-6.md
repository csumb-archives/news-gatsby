<h3>UCLA&#x2019;s&#xA0;Cheryl Keyes visits CSUMB&#xA0;</h3>

will be held from 10 to 11:50 a.m. in the Music Hall on Sixth
Avenue and Butler Street.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Keyes is the author of &#x201C;Rap Music and Street Consciousness,&#x201D;
which received a CHOICE award for outstanding academic books when
it was published in 2004.</p>
<p>This professor speaks the language of the streets; she also
speaks on panels and at seminars as a nationally recognized
rap/hip-hop scholar whose academic credentials include a Ph.D. from
Indiana University.</p>
<p>While &#x201C;rap&#x201D; defines the music, Dr. Keyes told the Long Beach
Press-Telegram, hip-hop embodies a larger &#x201C;youth art movement,&#x201D;
composed of music, graffiti, attitude and dress. Her work draws on
research she has done in West Africa, New York City, Detroit, Los
Angeles and London.</p>

according to Dr. Keyes, is a forum that addresses the political and
economic disenfranchisement of black youths and other groups,
fosters ethnic pride, and displays cultural values and aesthetics.
Blending popular culture with folklore and ethnomusicology, she
offers a nuanced portrait of the artists, themes, and various
styles reflective of urban life and street consciousness.<br>
<br>
A filmmaker, she has completed a documentary called &#x201C;Beyond Central
Avenue: Contemporary Female Jazz Instrumentalists of Los Angeles,&#x201D;
funded by UCLA&#x2019;s Center for Community Partnerships.<br>
<br>
Her musical creative works have been performed by the Women&#x2019;s Jazz
Orchestra of Los Angeles. As a performer, she played with trumpeter
Clark Terry&#x2019;s All-Girl All-Star Jazz Band, and she has recorded
with New Orleans rhythm-blues pianist Eddie Bo, and with jazz
clarinetist Alvin Batiste. Her debut CD, Let Me Take You There, won
an Image Award from the NAACP in the category of Outstanding World
Music Album.&#x201D;<br>
