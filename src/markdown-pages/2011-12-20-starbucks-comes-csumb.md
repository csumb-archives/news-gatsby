<p>Starbucks will soon be filling the cups of students, staff and
faculty at CSU Monterey Bay from a location in the Student
Center.</p>
<p><img alt="Starbucks coffee will soon be served in the Student Center" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/starbucks.jpeg" style="float:left; width:224px; height:224px">The coffee shop&apos;s
official opening is scheduled for Jan. 23 to coincide with the
start of the spring semester.&#xA0;It will provide students with a
comfortable place to gather, and feature standard Starbucks
beverages and some food.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;It will offer an assortment of hot breakfast items as well as
yogurt parfaits and bistro boxes,&#x201D; said Maria Garcia, director of
operations for the University Corporation. It will also have
assorted bakery items, including seasonal offerings such as pumpkin
scones during the fall.</p>
<p>Campus Dining Services will work with the Food Committee to give
students the opportunity to help pick some of the food offerings,
Garcia said.<br>
<br>
Meal plans will be accepted as payment, along with OtterBucks,
credit/debit cards and Starbucks gift cards.<br>
<br>
A variety of seating will be included &#x2013; a community table, a
computer bar, traditional caf&#xE9;/lounge seating and patio
seating.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Another attractive feature: the company&#x2019;s commitment to
environmental stewardship will be put into practice. That includes
recycling and efforts to minimize energy consumption and water
use.<br>
<br>
The decision to bring Starbucks to campus resulted from student
feedback. Last semester, Dining Services surveyed students about
their preferences for food options on campus. Focus groups and
student interviews and surveys were conducted.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The results showed that Starbucks was the preferred brand in the
coffee category,&#x201D; Garcia said.<br>
<br>
The University Corporation is paying the renovation costs; Sodexo
will be the licensee. Licensed stores, according to the Starbucks
website, provide the &#x201C;Starbucks Experience&#x201D; in a variety of
locations including grocery stores, hospitals, airports, department
stores. They offer the same products and customer service as
company-owned facilities.<br>
<br>
Starbucks at CSUMB will be open during the Student Center&#x2019;s hours
of operation.<br>
