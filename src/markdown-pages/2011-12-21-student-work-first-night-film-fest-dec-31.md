<h2>FIRST THINGS LAST<em>&#xA0;<br>
So long 2011, hello CSUMB First Night Film Fest</br></em></h2>
<p>First Night Monterey, the community New Year&apos;s Eve celebration,
will offer the opportunity to catch the work of filmmakers who
studied at CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s Teledramatic Arts and Technology
program.</p>
<p><img alt="Poster designed by CSUMB student Raissa Figueroa" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/poster12.jpg" style="float:left; width:285px; height:440px">Amid
family-friendly art workshops, music &#x2013; classical to jazz, blues to
rock, hip-hop to folk &#x2013; and the pageantry and puppetry of the
Twilight Procession parade, is the CSUMB First Night Film Fest.
&#xA0;<br>
<br>
Starting at 3:30 p.m. in the Museum of Monterey &#x2013; formerly the
Maritime Museum &#x2013; nine short films will be screened. They include
documentaries, animation and narratives. A lising of the films to
be screened can be found <a href="http://www.firstnightmonterey.org/FNM2012/Film.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</br></br></img></p>
<p>More than 70 performances are scheduled at 20 venues and locales
across the city from 3 p.m. to midnight. Admission buttons are
required for all indoor events. Adult prices are $20 in advance and
$25 on Dec. 31; youth prices are $12 and $15. Tickets are available
at a variety of locations around town and on the First Night
website.</p>
<p>First Night Monterey, now in its 19th year, is an alcohol-free
New Year&#x2019;s Eve community arts celebration designed for all ages.
Musicians, dancers, singers, poets and other artisans transform the
streets of the city into a festive setting. FNM is a nonprofit arts
organization whose mission is to bring families together and unite
the community in all its diversity through the visual and
performing arts.</p>
<p>A complete schedule is available <a href="http://www.firstnightmonterey.org." rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>The film fest isn&apos;t CSUMB&apos;s only contribution to First
Night.</p>
<p>Artwork by senior Raissa Figueroa graces the marketing materials
for the event &#x2013; the result of a longstanding relationship between
the university and the event&#x2019;s organizers. This year&#x2019;s theme is &#x201C;A
FantaSea of Art.&quot;</p>
<p>Members of Professor Bobbi Long&#x2019;s Publications Design course
have been designing the poster and button for First Night Monterey
since 2003.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These projects give students real-world experience of working
with a client and progressing through various stages of the design
process,&#x201D; Professor Long said.</p>
<p>Publication Design is not an art class &quot;where students just have
a muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you
have to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their
ideas, and you interpret that,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This program gives students a chance to show their talents,
skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and
respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a project.&quot;</p>
