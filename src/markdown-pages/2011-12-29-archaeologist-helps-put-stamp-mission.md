<h3>Stamp to be issued in 2012</h3>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service will honor nearly 250 years of
California history with the issuance of the Carmel Mission express
mail stamp, and a CSU Monterey Bay professor played a role in
it.</p>
<p>Archaeologist Ruben Mendoza served as an adviser and resource
consultant on the stamp. He worked on the narrative that will
accompany it, as well as details of the design.</p>

to address questions ranging from the colors of features depicted
in the stamp to the details and textures of pavements,
architectural elevations, shadows, wall heights and roof pitch,&#x201D; he
said.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Even the turquoise coloring of the bronze marker and the
placement of the palm trees fronting the church fa&#xE7;ade were aspects
of my inquiry.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The work entailed visits to the mission to collect information
and take photos &#x2013; Dr. Mendoza is an award-winning photographer. He
also provided historical images for the artists to use as
reference.</p>
<p>Often described as one of the most beautiful mission churches in
the state, Carmel Mission is known for its dome-shaped bell tower
and elaborate star-shaped window.</p>
<p>Formally known as Mission San Carlos Borrom&#xE9;o del R&#xED;o Carmelo,
Carmel Mission was founded on June 3, 1770. It was the second in
what would become a chain of 21 Spanish missions along the coast of
California, each positioned about one day&#x2019;s ride on horseback from
the next. Father Jun&#xED;pero Serra (1713-1784), the founder of the
California mission system, is buried there.</p>

artwork were done last spring, but the design wasn&#x2019;t made public
until December.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I was quite honored to have been asked to serve as the
consultant for this important addition to the philatelic heritage
of the United States,&#x201D; Dr. Mendoza said.</p>
<p>He&apos;s the right person for the job.</p>
<p>Dr. Mendoza has studied California&#x2019;s missions for years and has
done archaeological work at many of them, including those in
Carmel, San Juan Bautista, Soledad and San Miguel. He is a charter
board member of the California Missions Foundation and one of only
a handful of mission archaeology and conservation specialists in
California. Each spring, he teaches a class in mission archaeology.
It fills quickly.</p>
<p>Asked to name the most significant work he&#x2019;s done, he doesn&#x2019;t
hesitate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Discovering the Serra chapels at the Royal Presidio of
Monterey,&#x201D; he said. He&#x2019;s referring to the discoveries in the summer
of 2008 of the &#x201C;first&#x201D; and &#x201C;second&#x201D; chapels, each consisting of
rectangular adobe buildings located directly in front of the
present San Carlos Cathedral. The area marks the spot were, in
1770, Father Serra celebrated the earliest Mass in a formally
constructed church on the California coast.</p>
<p>Digging into the missions&#x2019; past is more than an academic
exercise or teaching tool for Dr. Mendoza. He believes that knowing
what went on there helps us understand who we are today, and how
California became what it is.</p>

<strong>DID YOU KNOW&#x2028;</strong><br>
<br>
&#x2022; The express mail stamp will cost $18.95.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; It&#x2019;s not the first time the Carmel Mission has been featured on a
stamp. A depiction of the mission&#x2019;s bells was featured on a
first-class stamp in 1969, to commemorate the bicentennial of the
settlement of California. The cost: six cents.<br>
