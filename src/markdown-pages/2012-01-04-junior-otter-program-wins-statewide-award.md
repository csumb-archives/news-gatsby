<p>The Migrant Junior Otter program based at CSU Monterey Bay has
won another award, the second time it has been honored in its short
history.</p>
<p><img alt="About 250 youngsters attend the Migrant Junior Otter program each summer" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mjo.jpeg" style="float:left; width:244px; height:192px">The program was
recognized in 2010 at the National Migrant Education Conference as
an outstanding example of a collaborative effort. This year, it was
selected for a Golden Bell Award from the California School Boards
Association.</img></p>
<p>Golden Bell Awards promote excellence in education by
recognizing outstanding programs in school districts and county
offices of education. They reflect the depth and breadth of
education programs necessary to address students&#x2019; changing
needs.</p>
<p>For a month each summer, 250 fourth through eighth graders get a
taste of what it&#x2019;s like to be a college student. They take classes
on the CSUMB campus in language arts and math, performing arts and
technology. And they are introduced to college life and learn what
it takes to be a successful student.</p>
<p>The university partners with the Monterey County Office of
Education and El Teatro Campesino &#x2013; the San Juan Bautista theater
group founded by Luis Valdez &#x2013; to provide the program.</p>
<p>And it is proving to be a successful collaboration. At the 2011
session, Carl del Grande, administrator for Migrant Education
Region XVI, said students who participated in 2010 showed a 25
percent increase in proficiency in English by the end of the
program and a 33 percent increase in math.</p>
<p>Perry Angle, director of early outreach and support programs at
CSUMB, as well as representatives from the MCOE and El Teatro will
attend the awards ceremony in San Diego on Dec. 3.</p>
