<h3>Weather, surf conditions delay launch until May</h3>
<p><img alt="SurfBot launch at Del Monte Beach" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/surfbot_launch_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:228px">Students in Dr.
Steve Moore&#x2019;s underwater robotics class in the fall of 2010 didn&#x2019;t
kick back over the winter break last January.</img></p>
<p>Instead, they volunteered to continue working on a project that
wasn&#x2019;t quite finished when the semester ended. The work &#x2013; some of
which took place in Professor Moore&#x2019;s cluttered garage amid tools,
electronic and mechanical parts and testing equipment &#x2013; extended
into the spring semester.</p>
<p>The class was working on SurfBot &#x2013; an 8-foot Styrofoam surfboard
to which two boogie boards and a pair of propellers are attached,
as well as a metal box containing cameras, batteries, computers and
electronics. Riding atop it all is a small stuffed otter, CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s mascot.</p>
<p>After several surf- and weather-related delays, SurfBot was
finally launched on May 8. It successfully completed its (revised)
mission &#x2013; to seek out and find a sunken sailboat and amphibious
vehicle in approximately 27 feet of water off Del Monte Beach in
Monterey.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of its name, it&apos;s not designed to surf,&quot; Dr. Moore
said. &quot;But it&apos;s the only surfboard I know that can swim and
navigate all by itself!&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="Alin Gonzalez works on the computer that drives the robot" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/rov1sm.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:301px">SurfBot finds its
way with the help of a GPS unit and a pair of tiny computers. A
video camera mounted on the robot beams live images back to shore.
If the robot gets into trouble, the students can override its
automatic navigation and use remote control to steer it from shore.
If that fails, students would use a kayak to rescue the bot. After
all, it&apos;s worth about $3,000.</img></p>
<p>The challenge given to the students was to build a robot that
could map the depth and contours of the upper Carmel Submarine
Canyon, a side branch of the famous Monterey Canyon.</p>
<p>But, according to Dr. Moore, &quot;that was just an excuse to make
learning more fun and effective.&quot; Carmel Canyon has already been
mapped accurately by CSUMB&apos;s Seafloor Mapping Lab, which uses much
more sophisticated technology to do the job. Dr. Moore planned to
use those maps to check the accuracy of the students&apos; results and
assign their grades accordingly.</p>
<p>The 17 students in the class were mostly biology and
environmental science, technology and policy students; one was
studying computer science.</p>
<p>Dr. Moore said that it&#x2019;s unusual for biology students to take
this kind of class. Normally, robotics this advanced would be
taught in an engineering program.</p>
<p>Alin Gonzlez, a biology major from San Francisco, was attracted
to the class because she thinks it will help her as she continues
her education.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I learned the basics of software,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I think I could
do smaller projects on my own now, and that will help me do
research in grad school.&#x201D; She has applied to Texas A&amp;M&#x2019;s
Fisheries Management program.</p>
<p><img alt="The " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/rov2sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:220px; height:201px">Cortland Jordan, an
environmental science, technology and policy student from Lake
Elsinore, was also attracted to the possibility of acquiring skills
that will help him pursue a graduate degree in applied technology
for ecology at Oregon State.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;. . . Many of us want to do this kind of thing in graduate
school. We got caught up in this project,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We were in the
lab every Thursday night for four hours. We ate pizza and built
robots.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The best part of this: In marine biology, it&#x2019;s very
competitive. This skill will give me a boost.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Jan. 29, the students&#x2019; skills were put to the test as SurfBot
was taken for a test drive at Moss Landing Harbor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We got some valuable vehicle performance data and we learned
some useful things that will improve the success of the mapping we
hope to do when the weather and ocean conditions cooperate,&#x201D; Dr.
Moore said at the time.</p>
<p>With the end of the spring semester looming, the right
conditions still hadn&apos;t materialized. That resulted in a change of
location and a revised mission.</p>
<p>Dr. Moore joined the faculty even before the university opened
its doors to students in the fall of 1995. He teaches an eclectic
mix of biology, physics and nature photography courses and runs the
Ecosystem Electronics Lab (EEL), the university&#x2019;s own scientific
research and development team.</p>
<p>He and his students &#x2013; including those in the robotics class &#x2013;
invent out of necessity, developing new research tools because they
don&#x2019;t yet exist or alternatives are cost-prohibitive. The result:
usable technologies that allow scientists and students to better
understand our world.</p>
<p>And, maybe have some fun while &#x201C;learning a bunch of stuff,&#x201D; as
Dr. Moore says.<br>
