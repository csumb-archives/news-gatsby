<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received a $15,000
grant from Wells Fargo to support its Small Business Development
Center, a program that provides counseling and training to small
businesses or people who are trying to start them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Wells Fargo grant will support advisers who can assist
aspiring and existing business owners to achieve their goals,&#x201D; said
Andrea Nield, the center&#x2019;s associate director. &#x201C;The grant allows
the SBDC to maximize the efforts of the whole team.&#x201D;</p>

opened in the fall of 2009, is located in a storefront in Gonzales
and has other offices in areas it serves along the Highway 101
corridor from Gilroy to King City. It provides critical services to
small business owners, helping them create jobs and solidify the
local economy.<br>
<br>
That aligns with Wells Fargo Foundation&#x2019;s RISE &#x2013; Rural Investment
for Sustainable Economies &#x2013; program, launched by the bank in 2011.
&#x201C;RISE is an effort to look at rural needs and target our resources
&#x2013; volunteer hours and grant funding &#x2013; there,&#x201D; said Sandy Cha,
assistant vice president and community affairs representative for
the bank, at an event at the university on Jan. 13.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This funding will help us extend our coverage and reach our whole
service area,&#x201D; said Marylou Shockley, chair of the School of
Business at CSUMB. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a hand-in-glove arrangement.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Working in partnership with community leaders, Wells Fargo&#x2019;s local
market leadership directs its giving through local grants that
address community development, education and human service needs of
communities served by the bank.</br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Wells Fargo understands the importance of workforce
development,&#x201D; said Joe Mathai, president for Wells Fargo&#x2019;s Valley
Coastal Market. &#x201C;As the largest lender to small businesses in the
nation, we are proud to support the SBDC as they help to strengthen
community economic efforts in rural communities. Our hope is to
support organizations focused on helping people and families
achieve self-sufficiency through employment or business start-up
during this tough economic climate.&#x201D;</p>
