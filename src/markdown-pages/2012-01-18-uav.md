<h2>CSUMB researcher honored for work in fighting wildfires from
the sky</h2>

member and senior research scientist at NASA has received the space
agency&apos;s Exceptional Public Service Medal.</img></p>
<p>Vince Ambrosia (pictured at left) of the university&apos;s Division
of Science and Environmental Policy and NASA&apos;s Ames Research Center
in Mountain View was honored for his work on the development and
use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies to provide
critical information to firefighters.</p>
<p>The medal is awarded to non-government employees and recognizes
exceptional contributions to the mission of NASA. It is one of the
agency&apos;s most prestigious honors.</p>
<p>NASA is known for putting astronauts on the moon and a telescope
in space, but it also works with agencies such as the U.S. Forest
Service to improve the observations of our own planet&apos;s phenomenon.
Ambrosia led one of those efforts, which involved demonstrating how
imaging systems on a UAV can be employed to provide critical
information about major blazes including the location, size and
terrain around the fires to commanders in the field in as little as
10 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;This unmanned aircraft can send real-time data around the clock
so that incident commanders can redeploy resources or get
firefighters out of harm&apos;s way,&quot; Ambrosia said. &quot;The UAVs provide a
safer way than manned vehicles to perform &apos;3-D missions&apos; - dull,
dirty and dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>Pilots at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center in the Mojave
Desert operate the aircraft from the ground. Sensors collect
detailed thermal-infrared imagery, even at night and through smoke
plumes up to 40,000 feet. A satellite data link allows real-time
transfer of the fire imagery to NASA Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, where it is quickly made available online to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, and to field
operations teams in simple visualization formats, including Goggle
Earth-compatible files.</p>
<p>&#xA0;&quot;Our project . . . showcases the reputation CSUMB has
gotten in the national community for having a strong Science and
Environmental Policy faculty,&quot; Ambrosia said. &quot;Some of our project
team members are former CSUMB students who have excelled here (at
NASA) and continue to showcase the strengths of the university and
the SEP program.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Susan Alexander is the faculty principal investigator for
the cooperative agreement between NASA and CSUMB. The two
organizations conduct collaborative research in ecological and
watershed systems with an emphasis on local, regional and global
environmental problems and issues resulting from changing climatic
and land-use patterns.</p>
<p>Graduate students in CSUMB&apos;s master&apos;s program in Coastal and
Watershed Science and Policy and advanced undergraduates in the
Environmental Science, Technology and Policy program have the
opportunity to work with researchers at NASA Ames.</p>
