<h3>Information sessions scheduled for CSUMB&apos;s social work
program</h3>
<p>Oscar Hernandez wants to help at-risk kids get on the right
path. This semester, the CSU Monterey Bay graduate student is doing
fieldwork at a local community center, where he mentors youngsters
with the goal of encouraging them to stay in school.</p>

his second year in the Master of Social Work program. His
attraction to social work isn&#x2019;t surprising. Simply put, social
workers help people improve their lives. Occupations in the field
include public services, counseling and therapy, and address issues
including medical, public and mental health.</img></p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there is a need for
more trained social workers, especially those who can connect with
underserved communities &#x2013; because the nation&#x2019;s diverse demographics
are growing.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in the Master of Social Work program at CSUMB
is invited to attend an information session scheduled for Jan. 23
The session will be held in the program&#x2019;s offices in Beach Hall,
located on Divarty Street between Fourth and Fifth avenues, from
noon to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Applications for fall 2012 must be received by Jan. 31.</p>
<p>The three-year program provides an opportunity for people who
are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance
in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is accessible
and affordable.</p>

in Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families, and prepare
for a broad array of job opportunities within government and
non-profits serving youth, the elderly, low-income families,
veterans, those who face health challenges and others.</img></p>
<p>Classes are currently offered in the evenings. Students must
also complete internships of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per
semester starting in the second year, at agencies in Monterey,
Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara counties.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Social workers serve people who are most often overlooked and
neglected,&#x201D; said Dr. Mayleen True, director of the MSW program at
CSUMB. &#x201C;So they often provide care that low-income families can&#x2019;t
afford.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Dr. True, it is imperative that today&#x2019;s social
workers are in tune with the community. CSUMB&#x2019;s program teaches
cultural competence, and, with field placements, the students put
it into practice. They are placed with local county and nonprofit
agencies, where they practice effective tactics to communicate with
different cultures.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It makes them more versatile,&#x201D; Dr. True said. &#x201C;They need to
have specialized clinical skills as well as people skills &#x2013; and
with a growing underserved and diverse population, the students
must know how to address issues in a culturally sensitive way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She added that &#x201C;our students come from an array of diverse
backgrounds: Asian, Latino, African American &#x2013; many of them
first-generation college students. They are proud of what they&#x2019;ve
accomplished and feel the need to give back to their own
communities, to become role models for others.&#x201D;</p>
