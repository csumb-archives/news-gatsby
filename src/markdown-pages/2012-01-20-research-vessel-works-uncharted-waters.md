Everyone at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant knew that
Professor Rikk Kvitek was authorized to enter the restricted
coastal waters around the plant &#x2013; except the guards with the
M-16s.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Rikk Kvitek and the KelpFly" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kelpflywork_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px; height:323px">Dr. Kvitek was
aboard CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s newest research vessel, the KelpFly, a
highly modified 160-horsepower Yamaha watercraft used for seafloor
mapping. He was gathering data on underwater fault lines near the
plant to help assess geologic hazards &#x2013; information critical to
public safety, especially in light of the disastrous earthquake and
tsunami that damaged Japan&#x2019;s Fukushima nuclear plant in March
2011.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was in a zone where guards were authorized to take lethal action
against intruders,&#x201D; Dr. Kvitek explained. &#x201C;The radios were going
nuts with reports of &#x2018;some guy on a jet ski.&#x2019; &#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Kvitek has previously mapped 1,200 square kilometers of
California&#x2019;s coastal waters, providing detailed topographical data
of the seafloor extending three miles from the coast. The KelpFly,
named for an insect species that lives on kelp, allows him to
gather data in areas just along the shore that his larger vessels
can&#x2019;t access.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;These are some of the most important areas to understand because
lots of animals live there, it is where coastal erosion and
sediment transfer occur, and it is where people play,&#x201D; Kvitek
said.<br>
<br>
The $300,000 craft can maneuver in water as shallow as 18 inches.
It features an armored hull that allows it to bounce off rocks
unharmed and a floatation collar that makes it stable in surf. To
navigate kelp, Dr. Kvitek mounted a customized aircraft fan engine
to the back of the vessel. The fan provides enough thrust to push
the hull over the kelp forest without damaging the plants or
clogging up the motor. It also carries an array of sonar equipment
and a laser mapping system that scans the shore to generate
seamless land-to-sea topographic maps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></p>

In addition to support from the university, funding came from
PG&amp;E and NOAA.<br>
<br>
The KelpFly performed two successful proof-of-concept trials at
Whaler&#x2019;s Cove near Point Lobos and Stillwater Cove in Pebble Beach
before being deployed at Diablo Canyon.<br>
<br>
On the water near the plant, Dr. Kvitek had no idea his life was in
jeopardy. Luckily, the guards received his credentials before
opening fire.<br>
<br>
Having survived Diablo Canyon, he is slated to complete work at
Elkhorn Slough and Morro Bay later this fall. He&#x2019;s also working
with the U.S. Navy to bring the vessel to their facilities at San
Clemente and San Nicholas Islands next year.
<p>The Navy is interested in mapping the near-shore habitat that
supports black abalone, a threatened species, and locating sand
channels amidst reefs and kelp forests where they can run
communication cables without harming the environment or causing
wear on the cables. They also will use the maps to plan amphibious
vessel landing trainings and mini-submarine explorations.<br>
<br>
CSUMB students participate in all this research, and Dr. Kvitek
makes sure Seafloor Mapping Lab projects have enough funding to pay
them for their work. Students assisted with construction and
deployment of the vessel, and process the data it collects.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Students learn to turn out a professional product that&#x2019;s of
great need and value for resource management agencies at the local,
state and federal level,&#x201D; he said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I take them out on the KelpFly when I can. But I don&#x2019;t let them
drive it. The ability to go really fast &#x2013; it goes up to 60 mph &#x2013; in
a short amount of time on a $300,000 vessel . . . I&#x2019;m not ready to
turn them loose on that,&#x201D; he said.</br></br></p>
