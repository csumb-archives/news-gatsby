<p>Langston Hughes died nearly 45 years ago, but the words of the
American poet, social activist, novelist and playwright still
resonate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Langston Hughes is probably even more relevant today,&#x201D; Dr. Ron
McCurdy, professor of music at USC, told the San Antonio
Express-News. &#x201C;Like other great artists, people realized after his
death just how important his work is.&#x201D;<br>

<img alt="Ron McCurdy" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mccurdysmall.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:383px">On Feb. 13, the Ron
McCurdy Quartet will perform &#x201C;The Langston Hughes Project &#x2013; Ask
Your Mama: 12 Moods for Jazz&#x201D; at 7:30 p.m. in the World Theater at
CSU Monterey Bay. The multimedia performance is part of the
university&#x2019;s celebration of Black History Month.<br>
<br>
The poem, &#x201C;Ask Your Mama,&#x201D; was written in 1960, when the Civil
Rights Movement was getting started and the Freedom Riders were
heading to the South.<br>
<br>
It addresses those issues and is among Hughes&#x2019; most ambitious work.
He planned to collaborate with Charles Mingus, and then Randy
Weston, and he wrote musical cues in the margin of the poem. The
scoring was designed to serve not as mere background but to forge a
conversation and a commentary with the music.<br>
<br>
The collaborations never happened, but Hughes did record the piece
without music. Dr. McCurdy and his collaborators have created music
and added a video component to the performance. The images come
from the Harlem Renaissance in the 1930s and &#x2019;40s.<br>
<br>
The words, sounds and images bridge the Harlem Renaissance, the
post-World War II beat writers&#x2019; coffeehouse jazz poetry world and
the looming Black Arts performance explosion of the 1960s.<br>
<br>
Dr. McCurdy told the Express-News that &#x201C;the compositions we wrote
support Hughes&#x2019; words. We don&#x2019;t hit people over the head. We&#x2019;ve
been told by people that after they&#x2019;ve heard the program, they want
to go out and learn.&#x201D;<br>
