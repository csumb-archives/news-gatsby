<p>The President&#x2019;s Speaker Series at CSU Monterey Bay resumes on

Border: To be a Woman in Juarez is a Death Sentence.&#x201D;</p>

at 7 p.m. at the World Theater, and will be followed by a
question-and-answer session. Tickets are not required for this free
event, but reservations are recommended and can be made <a href="http://csumb.edu/speakers" rel="nofollow">online</a>&#xA0;or by
calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580.</img></p>
<p>The border town of Juarez, Mexico, has been nicknamed the
&#x201C;capital of murdered women&#x201D; because more than 400 women have been
found raped, mutilated and murdered. Almost all of them worked in
<em>maquiladoras</em>, American-owned factories that cropped up
along the U.S.-Mexico border in the 1990s, following adoption of
the NAFTA treaty.</p>
<p>Martinez Jitner posed as a factory worker to uncover a dark
world of poverty, sexual abuse and murder. Her investigation led to
the production of her critically acclaimed documentary &#x201C;The
Border,&#x201D; and that, in turn, provided the inspiration for the
feature film &#x201C;Bordertown,&#x201D; starring Jennifer Lopez and Antonio
Banderas. Martinez Jitner served as executive producer of the
film.</p>
<p class="pullquote">The public is invited to a free showing of
&quot;Bordertown&quot; at 7 p.m., Feb. 21 in the World Theater.</p>
<p>The lecture will give a personal look at the crippling poverty
and gender discrimination that has made NAFTA&#x2019;s &#x201C;expendable
workforce&#x201D; into expendable human beings.</p>
<p>Martinez Jitner is the first Latina to be nominated for both a
Golden Globe and an Emmy, honors she earned for her work on
&#x201C;American Family,&#x201D; the first Latino drama on prime time network
television.<br>
<br>
She is currently adapting Victor Villasenor&#x2019;s bestselling book,
&#x201C;Rain of Gold,&#x201D; for an HBO miniseries.<br>
