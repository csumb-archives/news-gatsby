<h3>HE PUTS THE &apos;MOCK&apos; IN DEMOCRACY<br>
<em>Elect to laugh with Will Durst at the World Theater</em></br></h3>
<p>The World Theater gets in the spirit of the political season
when it hosts comedian Will Durst on March 8.</p>
<p><img alt="Will Durst" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/durst_mugshot_sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:197px">One of the premier
political satirists in the country, Durst has patched together a
comedy quilt of a career, weaving together columns, books, radio
and television commentaries, acting and stand-up comedy.</img></p>
<p class="pullquote"><em>Will Durst is a natural successor to Mort
Sahl.</em><br>
&#x2013; New York Post</br></p>
<p>His motto is &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t make stuff up like this.&quot; The New York
Times calls him &quot;possibly the best political comic in the country,&quot;
while the Portland Oregonian hails him as a &#x201C;hilarious stand-up
journalist.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The former radio talk show host currently writes a nationally
syndicated humor column, and his pieces have appeared in Esquire,
George, the San Francisco Chronicle, National Lampoon, The New York
Times and dozens of other publications.</p>
<p>He is a five-time Emmy nominee; has been fired by PBS three
times; told jokes in 14 countries; and earned seven nominations for
Stand-Up of the Year. His 800 or so television appearances include
The David Letterman Show, HBO, Showtime, CNN, all four broadcast
networks and the BBC.<br>
