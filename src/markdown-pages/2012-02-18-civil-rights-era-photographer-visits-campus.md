<h3>Bob Fitch&apos;s image of Martin Luther King was model for
monument</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s celebration of Black History Month continues
on Feb. 28 with &#x201C;My Eyes Have Seen: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
the Black Civil Rights Movement,&#x201D; a presentation by photojournalist
Bob Fitch.</p>
<p>The presentation will start at 7 p.m. in the University Center
on Sixth Avenue near B Street. The public is invited to this free
event.</p>
<p>Fitch &#x2013; who served as Dr. King&#x2019;s photographer at the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference &#x2013; will present famous and rarely
seen images of the Civil Rights icon.</p>
<p>He trained to be an engineer, and then a Protestant minister.
But, he says, &#x201C;Photojournalism seduced me. It is a compelling
combination of visual aesthetics, potent communication and story
telling. It is a way to effectively support the organizing for
social justice that is transforming our lives and future.&#x201D;<br>
In 1966, he took what has become an iconic shot of Dr. King. The
photograph served as the model for the Martin Luther King Monument
in Washington, D.C. Taken in Atlanta, it captured Dr. King with his
arms crossed, staring to his right. An illustration of Mahatma
Gandhi hangs nearby.</br></p>
<p>Another Fitch photo served as the model for the Cesar Chavez
commemorative postage stamp. His work has been featured in two
Smithsonian traveling exhibits and been reproduced globally in
print, film, and electronic media.</p>
<p>He has captured images of the farm worker movement, Dorothy Day
and the Catholic Workers, and Joan Baez and the peace movement, as
well as the Civil Rights movement. Visit his <a href="http://bobfitchphoto.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>&#xA0;to see
some of his work.</p>
<p>He lives in Watsonville and stays active in local political
empowerment campaigns and non-violent campaigns for peace and
justice.</p>
<p>The event is sponsored by Student Activities &amp; Leadership
Development at CSUMB, as part of its cultural enrichment
series.</p>
