<p>Few places in the world capture the imagination like the
American West. From the range, ranch, reservation and roadhouse,
from the valley of the Rio Grande to the Bitteroot Mountains in
Montana, &quot;Don&#x2019;t Fence Me In: Songs, Music and Poetry of the
American West&quot; explores the region&#x2019;s celebrated musical and oral
culture.</p>
<p>Cowboy songs and poetry, high plains yodeling, western swing
fiddle and vocal harmonies, lively Tex-Mex polkas and rancheras,
and Northern Plains pow-wow drum and song are performed by five
exceptional artists &#x2013; all working cowboys and other authentic
representatives of today&#x2019;s Western culture. These artists express
the vitality and power of tradition.</p>
<p>Performers include:<br>

&amp; The Wild West</strong>: Five-thirty in the morning is not an
hour generally claimed by musicians. Despite his successful career
as one of America&#x2019;s most popular Western entertainers, singer and
yodeler Wylie Gustafson still gets up every day at 5:30 to tend his
livestock &#x2013; it&#x2019;s what grounds him and is the backbone of his art,
he says.</img></br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>Los Texmaniacs</strong>, Tex-Mex conjunto: A Grammy
Award-winning group emerging from San Antonio&#x2019;s vibrant Tejano
music scene, Los Texamaniacs melds the classic conjunto sounds &#x2013;
rancheras, polkas, waltzes, cumbias and huapangos &#x2013; with Texas
rock, blues and R&amp;B and is putting its own stamp on musical
traditions that run deep in south Texas communities.</p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>The Quebe Sisters</strong>, western swing and Texas
fiddling: The three siblings from Fort Worth, Texas, bring a fresh,
youthful energy to the rich musical traditions of the Lone Star
State. They not only fiddle but also sing in three-part harmony.
They have appeared numerous times at the Grand Ole Opry, and at the
2010 Berkshire-Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, where ukulele
player Warren Buffet couldn&#x2019;t resist joining them on a song.</p>
<p>&#x2022;&#x2028; <strong>North Bear</strong>, Northern Plains pow-wow drum and
song: North Bear&#x2019;s members represent tribes from across the Great
Plains. The group performs hand drum songs with youthful energy and
style influenced by modern rhythm and blues and hip-hop.</p>

Zarzyski</strong>, rodeo poet: Recipient of the Montana Governor&apos;s
Award for Literature, Zarzyski spent 15 years on the rodeo circuit
as a bareback bronc rider before deciding to concentrate solely on
poetry. Nine collections of his poetry have been published.</img></p>
<p>The program is a presentation of the National Council for the
Traditional Arts (NCTA), a private, not-for-profit corporation
dedicated to the presentation and documentation of folk and
traditional arts in the United States. Founded in 1933, it is the
oldest folk arts organization in the nation. &#x2028;</p>
<p>NCTA programs celebrate and honor arts that are deeply rooted
cultural expressions &#x2013; music, crafts, stories and dance passed down
through time by families, communities, tribal, ethnic and
occupational groups.<br>
