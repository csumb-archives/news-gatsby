Spalding</a></p>
<h3>Prestigious program moves to campus in 2012</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay is the new home of CSU
Summer Arts.<br>
<br>
Starting this summer, the annual month-long program offering
academic credit plus a festival in the visual, performing, literary
and new media arts, will be held at CSU Monterey Bay. It will be
hosted by the Seaside campus for at least five years.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a tremendous vote of confidence in the breadth and quality
of our arts programs,&quot; President Dianne Harrison said. &quot;Summer Arts
will offer unprecedented opportunities for our students and our
communities.&quot;</br></br></br></br></p>
<p><img alt="Contemporary painting is also offered this summer" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/contemporary-rotate.gif" style="float:left; width:242px; height:288px">In April 2011, a
committee of arts faculty members from throughout the CSU visited
four campuses in the running to host the program. Fresno State,
which has housed the program for the last 13 years, was considered,
along with San Francisco State and Chico State.</img></p>
<p>CSUMB was selected for several reasons, said Summer Arts
Director Jim Spalding.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;CSUMB&#x2019;s arts programs are blossoming and that&#x2019;s a good environment
for Summer Arts,&#x201D; Spalding said. He added that the committee was
impressed with the university&apos;s connection to and support from its
surrounding communities.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;And the location is great,&quot; Spalding said. &quot;I think our program
works well in a smaller, community setting like this.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The academic component offers two sessions of two-week courses for
students and professionals in creative writing, dance, music, film,
video, theater, visual arts, design and new technology. Local high
school, community college and university students, as well as
international students, study with guest artists in intensive
workshops and master classes. Students earn academic credit for
their work.<br>
<br>
The other component of Summer Arts is a festival, open to the
public. World-renowned guest artists offer performances, exhibits,
concerts and lectures at affordable ticket prices. Guest artists
have included The Second City, New York New Music Ensemble, Bebe
Miller Dance Company, Bobby McFerrin, Jane Henson and the Muppets,
San Francisco Mime Troupe and Edward Albee. Among artists scheduled
to teach this summer at Fresno State are the Grammy Award-winning
Kronos Quartet and Steppenwolf Theatre Company.<br>
<br>
Under the direction of Professor Renee Curry, CSU Monterey Bay
submitted a proposal in December 2010, after a year of working with
various campus departments and community partners to secure their
support<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t tell you how exciting this is for us,&#x201D; Dr. Curry said.
&#x201C;Local students will have premier summer opportunities to work in
the arts with international artists. And students from around the
state and beyond will also come to campus to take advantage of this
opportunity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Summer Arts started 26 years ago and has been located at Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo, Humboldt State, CSU Long Beach and Fresno
State.<br>
