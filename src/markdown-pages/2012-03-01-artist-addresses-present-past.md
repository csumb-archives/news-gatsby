<h3><br>
Michael Arcega visits CSUMB March 8 as Visiting Artist Series
continues</br></h3>

<p>Conceptual artist Michael Arcega likens the titles of his works
to punch lines. There&#x2B9;s El Conquistadork, a 10&#x2010;foot high Spanish
galleon he made from manila folders, and Conquistadorks I &amp; II,
elaborate suits of armor also crafted with manila folders.</p>
<p>The titles speak to the artist&#x2B9;s quirky sense of humor and his
obsession with wordplay, while using humor to delve into weighty
issues. Born in Manila, the artist uses his puns to address his
interest in Filipino history, imperialism and global,
socio&#x2010;political issues.</p>
<p>The local community will have the opportunity to learn about
Arcega&#x2019;s work when he visits CSU Monterey Bay on March 8. His free
talk, part of the Visiting Artists Series, will start at 6 p.m. in
the University Center living room. The University Center is located
on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Driving directions and a campus map
can be found at csumb.edu/map.</p>
<p>&#x2BA;I use manila folders to talk about trade and business and
colonialism. Having paper armor, I think, shows the frailty of
military strength,&#x201D; he told an interviewer for KQED TV&#x2019;s Spark
program.</p>
<p>His other works comment on and satirize contemporary themes,
like the United States&#x2B9; complicated relationship with oil
production. In Gaud We Trust, a 12&#x2010;foot&#x2010;high gothic cathedral
constructed with black petroleum&#x2010;based plastic, features oil
derricks as its spires and a cross that looks as if it is spitting
out black gold.</p>
<p>Although many of his works are mixed&#x2010;media sculptures, Arcega is
a true interdisciplinary artist whose works range from paintings to
installations, videos to drawings. He earned a B.F.A. in
interdisciplinary studies at the San Francisco Art Institute in
1998 and an MFA from Stanford in 2009.</p>
