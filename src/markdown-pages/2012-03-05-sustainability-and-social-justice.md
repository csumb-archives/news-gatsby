<p>&#x201C;Sustainability and Social Justice&#x201D; is the topic to be addressed
on March 7 when CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s annual Focus the Region teach-in
and Social Justice Colloquium jointly present a program of
speakers, films and panel discussions.</p>
<p class="pullquote">A complete schedule is available <a href="http://csumb.edu/focus" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>&quot;We think of sustainability in terms of environmental issues,
economic issues and social justice issues,&quot; said Dr. Dan Fernandez,
chair of CSUMB&apos;s Division of Science and Environmental Policy. &quot;The
most neglected of these three pillars is social justice.</p>
<p>&quot;Social justice needs to go hand-in-hand with environmental and
economic issues,&quot; Dr. Fernandez said.</p>
<p>All events will take place in the University Center on Sixth
Avenue. CSUMB President Dianne Harrison will open the program will
brief remarks at 1 p.m.<br>
