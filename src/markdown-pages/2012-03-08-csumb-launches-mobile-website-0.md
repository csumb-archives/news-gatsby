<p><strong>UPDATE:&#xA0;</strong>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s mobile website,
launched in June 2011, has won a top honor among universities,
colleges and independent schools in the western United States.</p>
<p>The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE)
awarded CSUMB a gold in its Awards of Excellence competition in the
individual sub-website category. CSUMB beat out Stanford
University&#x2019;s School of Medicine and California State University&#x2019;s
50th anniversary website for the top honor.</p>
<p>This story was published in June 2011, when the site was
launched:</p>

<p>Want a CSU Monterey Bay map and campus tour, university news and
sports results at your fingertips?</p>

<img alt="front page of mobile website" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/screen_shot_mobile_at_1.35.23_pm_0.png" style="float:right; width:400px; height:250px">CSUMB has just
launched a mobile version of its website &#x2013; complete with news,
sports, event listings and dining hall hours &#x2013; that can be accessed
<a href="http://csumb.edu/mobile" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It&#x2019;s
simpler, faster and formatted for smaller screens.<br>
<br>
The mobile website is accessible via devices such as iPhone,
Blackberry and Android-based smart phones and tablets using the
devices&#x2019; built-in web browser. It includes tools designed to help
the community as well as students, faculty and staff navigate
campus information.<br>
<br>
Students find it especially useful since it allows them to check
their class schedule and campus accounts, access the bus schedule
and renew library books.<br>
<br>
Because a growing number of people &#x2013; on and off campus &#x2013; are
accessing the web via handheld devices, CSUMB President Dianne
Harrison thought it was essential to provide information in a
format that would accommodate those users.<br>
<br>
CSUMB is now among the 9 percent of American colleges and
universities that have mobile websites, according to the Mobile in
Higher Education website. (Read the survey <a href="http://www.dmolsen.com/mobile-in-higher-ed/2011/02/01/results-from-higher-ed-mobile-website-tech-survey/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br>
<br>
The mobile site was developed in-house by Kevin Miller and Greg
Pool of the university&#x2019;s Information Technology staff, with help
from several students majoring in computer science, and Liz
MacDonald and Kevin Garcia of the communications staff. It follows
on the redesign and relaunch of the university&apos;s website,
csumb.edu, in October 2010.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
