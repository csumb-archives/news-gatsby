Women&#x2019;s History Month, Dolores Huerta will speak at CSU Monterey
Bay on March 14. The public is invited to this free event,
scheduled for 7 p.m. in the World Theater.</img></p>
<p>The most prominent Chicana labor leader in the United States,
Huerta co-founded the United Farm Workers union with Cesar Chavez.
She has been an organizer and advocate for workers&#x2019; rights,
immigrants&#x2019; rights and women&#x2019;s rights for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>Huerta was a founding member of the Stockton chapter of the
Community Service Organization (CSO) in 1955. The CSO battled
segregation and police brutality; led voter registration drives;
pushed for improved public services; and fought to enact new
legislation. Through the CSO she met Chavez, and the two realized
the need to organize farm workers in California.</p>
<p>In 1962, Huerta and Chavez resigned from the CSO and formed the
group that would eventually become the United Farm Workers. The
group rose to prominence in the 1970s after it organized a national
grape boycott to raise consumer awareness of the poor working
conditions of immigrant farm workers. Their work resulted in union
contracts, better working conditions and health care for field
workers.</p>
<p>Huerta continues to work as the public face of the UFW. She has
won numerous awards, including the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights
Award in 1998, and was inducted into the National Women&#x2019;s Hall of
Fame in 1993.</p>
