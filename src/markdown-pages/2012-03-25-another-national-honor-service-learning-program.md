<p>CSU Monterey Bay was a finalist for the Presidential Award as
part of the 2012 President&#x2019;s Higher Education Community Service
Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition a college or university
can receive for its commitment to community service.</p>
<p>The Corporation for National and Community Service received
applications from more than 640 colleges and universities. Five
received the Presidential Award; 14 were named finalists.</p>
<p>In 2006, the program&#x2019;s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one
of three recipients of the top award. It has been named to the
Honor Roll each year since then. The university earned the top
honor again last year, making it the only two-time recipient of the
President&#x2019;s Award.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only is service learning woven into our curriculum,&quot;
President Dianne Harrison said, &quot;it also is part of our
university&apos;s ethos of engaging with and contributing to our
surrounding communities.&quot;</p>
<p>The university was honored in the category of general community
service, which recognizes the quality of and commitment to
community service initiatives, and emphasizes long-term
partnerships and measurable outcomes as a result of the
service.</p>

<p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of
the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all
students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB&#x2019;s students enroll
in service learning courses contributing more than 65,000 hours of
service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and
government agencies in the tri-county area. And service learning is
an academic department, where issues of service, diversity, social
justice and social responsibility are linked to the core
curriculum.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally
and even internationally,&#x201D; said Dr. Seth Pollack, director of
CSUMB&#x2019;s Service Learning Institute.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No other university in the country has made as significant a
commitment to developing students&#x2019; capacity for service and social
responsibility,&#x201D; Dr. Pollack said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have a very special program, and it feels great to again be
recognized as a national leader.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The awards ceremony was held March 12 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>According to the Corporation for National and Community Service,
honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors,
including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent
to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the
school&#x2019;s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and
measurable community outcomes as a result of the service.<br>
