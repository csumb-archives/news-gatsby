<h3>Forum explores issues of data mining as we enter the cloud</h3>
<p>Every time we click on a website, pay for something with a
credit card or drive across a toll bridge using FastTrak, we leave
a digital trail.<br>
<br>

attention to that trail? It&apos;s not just Big Brother Government; it&apos;s
also Big Brother Google, Big Brother Target and Big Brother
Facebook. It&apos;s called data mining and it happens because our
digital data is valuable, especially when it&apos;s viewed
demographically.</img></br></br></p>
<p>As our digital culture embraces the promises of cloud computing
and doing almost everything online, is it possible for individuals
to retain any sense of privacy?<br>
<br>
That&#x2019;s the topic that will be discussed at the annual Ethics Forum
sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s schools of Business and Information
Technology and Communication Design. The free event will be held
from 3 to 5 p.m. on March 28 in the University Center on Sixth
Avenue and B Street.<br>
<br>
Panelists include Lee Tien, senior staff attorney with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation; Alec Arago from Congressman Sam
Farr&#x2019;s office; William Boogess (retired) from the Defense Manpower
Data Center; Adam Swidler of Google; and Cheryl Washington,
information security officer for the University of California
system.<br>
<br>
Chip Lenno, CSUMB&#x2019;s chief information officer, will moderate the
panel.<br>
