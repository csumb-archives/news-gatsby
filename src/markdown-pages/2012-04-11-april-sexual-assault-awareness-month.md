<h2>But it&#x2019;s a 365 day-a-year problem</h2>
<p>Following on the heels of Eve Ensler&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Vagina Monologues,&#x201D;
CSU Monterey Bay students continue their campaign to end sexual
violence against women with two performances of &#x201C;The MENding
Monologues.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="The MENding Monologues comes to CSUMB" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mending_4x5.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:313px">Both a bookend and
male response to Ensler&#x2019;s play &#x2013; which has been produced at CSUMB
for 11 years &#x2013; Derek Dujardin&#x2019;s production borrows the monologue
format, featuring stories of how men are affected when violence is
waged against women.</img></p>
<p>Performances will be held at 8 p.m. on April 25 and 26 in the
Black Box Cabaret. Tickets are $5 for students, $10 general.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Men are stepping up to take part in ending sexual assault, an
issue that many are beginning to recognize affects them as well,&#x201D;
said MENDing student producer Margo Flitcraft.</p>
<p>One of those men is student Mark Weddle, co-director of the play
along with Destiny Mattson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wanted to direct The MENding Monologues so I can have a more
active role in ending sexual assault and violence against women,&#x201D;
Weddle said.</p>
<p>He thought it would be difficult to get men to audition, but
that proved not to be the case. &#x201C;We had 32 people audition and
selected a cast of 24, 19 men and five women. The cast of this
year&#x2019;s Vagina Monologues proved immensely helpful in talking with
the men in their lives and encouraging them to come out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The MENding Monologues is just one of a series of programs and
events that have been organized at CSUMB to commemorate Sexual
Assault Awareness Month, raise public awareness of the issue and
educate communities and individuals on how to prevent it.</p>
<p>How pervasive is the problem?</p>
<p>The National Institute of Justice found that about 1 in 5 women
and 6 percent of men are victims of sexual assault while in
college. According to data collected under the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Crime Statistics Act in 2009, college campuses
reported nearly 3,300 forcible sex offenses. (<a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf)" rel="nofollow">Source: United States Department of Education,
Office for Civil Rights</a>)</p>
<p>At CSUMB, Health &amp; Wellness Services took the lead in
convening a committee of student clubs and organizations and campus
departments to organize activities throughout the month. Some
events are sponsored by student groups, others by Health and
Wellness Services.</p>
<p>The first event was held April 2 on the Main Quad. The &#x201C;Time to
Stop Rape&#x201D; flag display was intended to get the campus community
talking about the issue.</p>
<p>Other events include:</p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>April 12</strong>, noon to 2 p.m., in front of the
library: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Time to Talk,&#x201D; which will address sexual assault
stereotypes and prevention</p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>April 17</strong>, 7 p.m., Cross Cultural Center:
showing of &#x201C;Boyhood Shadows,&#x201D; a film about male victims of child
sexual abuse, and panel discussion</p>

25</strong>, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Main Quad: Denim Day, when women
are urged to wear jeans with a purpose, as a sign of protest
against the myths surrounding sexual assault</img></p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>April 25 and 26</strong>, 8 p.m., Black Box Cabaret:
&quot;The MENding Monologues&quot;</p>
<p>&#x2022; <strong>April 27</strong>, 1 to 6 p.m., Student Center and
Main Quad: &#x201C;SlutWalk,&#x201D; a worldwide protest prompted by remarks from
a Toronto police officer that women should avoid dressing like
sluts in order not to be victimized</p>
<p>&#x201C;Health and Wellness Services has been a leader in sexual
assault prevention efforts at CSUMB because we realize that we must
do more than increase students&#x2019; knowledge about the issue,&#x201D; said
Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We &#x2013; students, staff and faculty &#x2013; must work together to
empower our campus community to take action to stop sexual
assault,&#x201D; Rodriguez said.</p>
