<p>CSU Monterey Bay is looking for local professionals to help at a
career expo on April 27.</p>
<p>Organized by faculty members from the statistics, math and
technology departments, along with the university&#x2019;s career services
office, the expo is intended for students in math and computer
science. The goal is to expose them to a wide range of career
options and to help them prepare for those careers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re asking for volunteers from any organization that hires
computer science or math students,&#x201D; said Dr. Kate Lockwood, who
teaches computer science. &#x201C;Participants can be on a panel, network
with students, or hold mock interviews.&#x201D; Volunteers can come from
government, education or industry.</p>
<p>The day will include panel discussions and networking in the
morning and mock interviews in the afternoon. All will take place
in the Student Center, located on Inter-Garrison Road between
Fourth and Fifth avenues. Driving directions and a campus map are
available at csumb.edu/map.<br>
<br>
The career expo is part of STaMP &#x2013; Statistics, Technology and Math
Professionals &#x2013; a new effort that supports students in those
fields. Events leading up to the expo have included workshops on
resume writing, business etiquette and interviewing.</br></br></p>
