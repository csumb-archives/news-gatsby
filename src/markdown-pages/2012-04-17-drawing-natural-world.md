<h2>Instructor contributes to book from Harvard Press</h2>
<p>Once in a great while, as The New York Times noted recently, a
naturalist writes a book that changes the way people look at the
living world. John James Audubon&apos;s &quot;Birds of America,&quot; published in
1838, was one. Roger Tory Peterson&apos;s 1934 &quot;Field Guide to the
Birds&quot; was another.</p>

to that list.</img></p>
<p>&quot;Field Notes on Science and Nature,&quot; published in 2011 by
Harvard University Press, allows readers to peer over the shoulders
and into the notebooks of a dozen researchers, to study first-hand
their observational methods, materials and fleeting
impressions.</p>
<p>&quot;Field Notes&quot; offers specific examples that professional
naturalists can emulate to fine-tune their own field methods, along
with practical advice that amateur naturalists and students can use
to document their adventures.</p>
<p>Some of that practical advice comes from Jenny Keller, an
instructor in the Science Illustration program at CSU Monterey Bay,
who contributed a chapter and the cover illustration.<br>
<br>
Her chapter is titled &#x201C;Why Sketch?&#x201D; In it, she encourages
scientists to give it a try, and offers some basic drawing
instruction.<br>

make the case that it&#x2019;s doable and here&#x2019;s how,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not
that hard to add some simple visuals to your field observations,
and it will deepen the amount of information your field notes can
capture. The drawings will be able to say things that are hard to
capture in words.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Careful observation makes you a better scientist, and drawing is a
great way to observe,&#x201D; Keller said.<br>
<br>
The project started several years ago when the book&#x2019;s editor,
Michael Canfield, contacted Keller out of the blue. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know
how he found me, but we talked animatedly for about 90 minutes, and
then we realized that we wanted to work together on the project,&#x201D;
she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&#x2019;m honored to be in the company of these naturalists. Some of my
biggest heroes are contributors to this book,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
Keller came to CSUMB when the science illustration program moved to
the university from its original home at UC Santa Cruz Extension in
the fall of 2009.<br>
<br>
She teaches field sketching, applied techniques in natural science
illustration, zoological illustration and history of scientific
illustration.<br>
<br>
She combined her lifelong interests in art and science when she
began keeping illustrated field journals in 1981. Since that time,
sketching natural subjects from life has continued to inspire and
inform her other illustration projects, which have centered on
mammals, birds, and botanical subject matter.<br>
<br>
Her work has appeared in numerous books, magazine and other
publications. In 1992, &#x201C;Dolphin Days,&#x201D; a book she illustrated, won
the John Burroughs Award for best book of the year in natural
history.<br>
