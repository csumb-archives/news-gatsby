<p>A coloring book is helping children in New Zealand learn about
that country&#x2019;s marine environment, thanks to the work of a graduate
of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Science Illustration program.</p>
<p><img alt="Corlis Schneider" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/corlis_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:415px">Corlis Schneider,
who earned a certificate from the program in 2011, created
illustrations for the book as part of an internship at the New
Zealand Marine Studies Centre and Aquarium in Dunedin.</img></p>
<p>Schneider is among a small number of professional artists who
make up the field of science illustrators, people who work at the
confluence of art and science.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re younger, you don&#x2019;t think there is a way to
reconcile a love for art and science,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;So you grow up
focusing on science, like I did, or art.</p>
<p>While earning a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in marine biology from UC
Santa Cruz, she realized that her favorite classes were the labs
where students had to illustrate their specimens.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dr. Mary Silver taught several classes that I took, and she
recognized my passion for drawing. She invited me to start
illustrating plankton for a website in her lab. That was my first
real taste of science illustration,&#x201D; Schneider said.</p>
<p>After graduation, she worked in several biology labs, and
started thinking about graduate school. That&#x2019;s when a friend
reminded her about the program at CSUMB.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I ended up procrastinating on my marine science application and
spending every day after work putting together a portfolio for the
science illustration program. It was clearly the right decision for
me,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>She landed in New Zealand when the Marine Studies Centre
contacted the program looking for interns. New Zealand sounded
&#x201C;exotic,&#x201D; Schneider said, and she knew she could focus on marine
illustrations.</p>
<p>The centre wanted a coloring book, which was a &#x201C;substantial
project for a two-month period, but I really enjoyed the
experience,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>A second internship, at the California Academy of Sciences in
San Francisco, started soon after her return to the U.S. That one
lasted three months and involved pen-and-ink drawings of snake eel
specimens.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;d recommend the program at CSUMB. &#x201C;I learned more in the
nine months on campus than I have from any other program or class I
have taken,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a much better illustrator and confident
in my abilities now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The program was definitely boot camp, but &#x201C;it was worth it for
me.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have been freelancing for about three months now in Los Angeles,
and I am loving it.&#x201D;<br>
