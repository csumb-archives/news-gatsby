<p>The Monterey Bay Film Society will show the 2011

produced by Doug Mueller of Carmel Valley, a 2003 graduate of CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department.
Mueller, a staff member of the Carmel Bach Festival, will speak at
the event and will display more than 100 hand-drawn storyboards he
created for the film.</img></p>
<p>At Sundance, &#x201C;Prairie Love&#x201D; was one of eight films selected to
compete in the NEXT category, which highlights innovative work in
low-budget &#x2013; under $500,000 &#xAC;&#x2013; filmmaking. It was one of only 200
films selected from more than 10,0000 that were submitted to the
festival that year.</p>
<p>According to Mueller, &#x201C;The film is about three eccentric
characters who are trying to find companionship in a desolate
situation.&#x201D; The story was filmed in and around Minot, N.D., where
Mueller went to high school.</p>
<p>This will be the film&#x2019;s only local showing. It will be
accompanied by a short film on the Monterey Bay Film Society and
how it achieves its mission.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&quot;An unnervingly romantic, starkly humorous,
and startlingly composed drama.&quot;<br>
