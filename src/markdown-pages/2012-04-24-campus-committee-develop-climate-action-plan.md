<p>A newly reformed committee at CSU Monterey Bay is continuing to
develop a Climate Action Plan that will eventually result in
achieving the goal of zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The university works to promote sustainability with numerous
classes incorporating environmentally focused skills and issues.
The campus supports sustainable practices, including transportation
programs to get people out of their cars, organic food in its
dining halls, recycling efforts, a solar power farm, and projects
that have substantially reduced electricity use on campus.<br>
<br>
The last two major campus construction projects &#x2013; the Tanimura
&amp; Antle Family Memorial Library and the renovation of the
Dining Commons &#x2013; earned LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) silver certification.<br>
<br>
Developing the Climate Action Plan will be undertaken by the Campus
Sustainability Committee, whose members include students, faculty
and staff. The plan fulfills the American College and University
Presidents&apos; Climate Commitment that President Dianne Harrison
signed in 2007, and pledges the university to a path of climate
neutrality.<br>
