<h2>Journalist explores ills of Monterey Peninsula&apos;s primary water
source</h2>

presents a remarkable test case for a messed-up river. Almost
everything that can go wrong with a river system through human
activity has happened,&quot; said hydrologist (and former CSU Monterey
Bay faculty member) Robert Curry in 1981.</img></p>
<p>Journalist Ray March has made Dr. Curry&#x2019;s quote the opening line
of his new book, &#x201C;River in Ruin: The Story of the Carmel River,&#x201D;
which portrays a river that has been dammed, diverted and leaned on
for at least 130 years.</p>
<p>March will visit the campus of CSU Monterey Bay on May 10 to
talk about his book and sign copies. The public is invited to this
free lecture, which will be start at 6 p.m. in the OLLI Building at
Inter-Garrison Road and Sixth Avenue. Reservations are suggested
and can be made by calling 582-5500.<br>

The thin ribbon of the Carmel River is just 36 miles long and no
wider in most places than a child can throw a stone. It is the
primary water supply for the tourists, residents and businesses on
the Monterey Peninsula; it is also one of the top 10 endangered
rivers in North America, according to the nonprofit organization
American Rivers.</br></br></p>
<p>March, who grew up in Carmel, remembers when the river flowed
clean and its banks were free of concrete rubble, automobile tires
and abandoned cars. The book is a very personal explanation and
analysis of the forces that brought the river to its current
state.</p>
<p>&#x201C;River in Ruin&#x201D; weaves water history &#x2013; local and larger &#x2013;with
the natural, social and environmental narrative of the Carmel
River. March traces the river&#x2019;s misuse from 1879 and details how
increasingly successful promotions of Monterey demanded more and
more water. As a result, the river was disastrously depleted and
inhospitable to the fish prized by visitors and residents
alike.</p>
<p>March&#x2019;s book is a cautionary tale about squandering precious
water resources &#x2013; about the ultimate cost of a ruined river and the
slim but urgent hope of bringing it back to life.<br>

Books will be available for purchase at the event.<br>

<strong>What reviewers are saying:</strong></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Having hiked most of the river from its headwaters to its mouth,
I believed that I knew the Carmel River well. So I was surprised to
encounter &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know that!&#x201D; moments on page after page of
March&#x2019;s book. It is the product of more than a decade of research
and reporting, and his attention to telling detail shows.<br>
&#x2013; <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></br></p>
<p>This succinct work combines (March&#x2019;s) skills as a writer with
his familiarity with Monterey geography to provide readers with a
thorough understanding of how the Carmel River has slipped into
ecological disaster&#x2026;Water, especially in the West, is a commodity
profoundly affected by population growth, weather, dams, forest
fires, politics, and economics. March covers all these factors to
provide the fullest possible picture of the river&#x2019;s decline as his
narrative moves from past to present and possible future.<br>
&#x2013; <em>Library Journal</em></br></p>
<p>Saturated with facts, March&#x2019;s account of this threatened river
forces readers to reconsider water as a commodity that requires
protection.<br>
