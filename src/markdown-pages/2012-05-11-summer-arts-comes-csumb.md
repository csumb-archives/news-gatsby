<h3>Classes, public performances highlight program</h3>
<p>Sword fights, improvisational comedy, animation, hip-hop: Summer
school was never this much fun.</p>

students from throughout the California State University system and
beyond will come to CSU Monterey Bay in July for the annual CSU
Summer Arts program. High school and community college students and
faculty, as well as local residents are also welcome to enroll in
the 15 classes that will be offered.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Summer Arts will benefit students and the local community by
providing them with opportunities to study with premier artists
from around the world,&#x201D; said Professor Renee Curry, who led the
effort to relocate the 28-year-old program to CSUMB.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bringing Summer Arts to campus clearly announces to our
tri-county area that we have come of age as a provider of
significant arts education to students and as a provider of
extraordinary performances to the community.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to Joanne Sharp, assistant director of CSU Summer
Arts, more than 35 public events will be held, including lectures,
readings, concerts and theatrical productions.</p>
<p>In other words, the area&#x2019;s summer arts scene has gotten a lot
more interesting.</p>
<p>Summer Arts will be based at CSU Monterey Bay for at least five
years. The university beat out Fresno State, which housed the
program for more than a decade, San Francisco State and Chico State
to be the host campus.</p>

because our facilities are multi-purpose and we were open to a wide
variety of art forms,&#x201D; Dr. Curry said. &#x201C;And we have great support
from local arts organizations.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Students are immersed in rigorous training, 12 to 14 hours a
day, every day during the two-week sessions. They earn three units
of academic credit for each course. Master teachers and guest
artists teach the classes. Each offers a public performance or
culmination at the end of the session.</p>
<p>Dr. Umi Vaughan is one of those teachers. An assistant professor
of Africana Studies at CSUMB, he will teach an Afro-Brazilian
rhythm workshop. The course will bring together two of Brazil&#x2019;s
most famous musical organizations &#x2013; Manguiera and Ile Aiye &#x2013; for
the first time ever.</p>
<p>Dr. Vaughan expects the class to be a &#x201C;game-changer for anyone
interested in performing Brazilian music.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stage combat is another one of the classes being offered. It
gives participants an opportunity to channel their inner
swashbuckler while learning to perform exciting, historically
accurate and safe stage sword fights.</p>
<p>Preparing classrooms, assigning residence halls, working with
course coordinators, arranging for meals and reaching out to
community arts organizations are some of the ongoing activities to
get CSUMB ready for Summer Arts.</p>
<p>The budget is $1.7 million, Sharp said, a welcome addition to
the local economy. That doesn&#x2019;t include money spent by the 250 to
400 students and instructors who are expected to attend.</p>
<p>Most public performances will be on campus, at the World
Theater, Music Hall, Meeting House and Black Box Cabaret; a few
will be held in the community. In mid-May, the schedule will be
available at csusummerarts.org. Tickets can be ordered online or,
after June 1, by calling (831) 582-3499 for tickets.</p>
<p>Rob Klevan is the community relations specialist for Summer
Arts. He served as director of music and fine arts at Robert Louis
Stevenson School for 27 years, is jazz education director emeritus
for the Monterey Jazz Festival, director of bands at UC Santa Cruz,
big band director at Monterey Peninsula College and jazz studies
director at York School.</p>
