<p>As they wrap up impressive undergraduate careers and receive
their degrees on May 19, four science students are looking ahead
with lofty goals of what they want to accomplish.</p>

years of research already completed, Isael Rubio of Salinas, Kevin
Johnson of Hollister, Eric Ross of Los Osos and Alexandra Davis of
Albuquerque, N.M., are poised to make contributions in their
fields.</img></p>
<p>All four are headed to graduate school courtesy of National
Science Foundation fellowships, which provide $90,000 plus tuition
and fees, to support three years of graduate education.</p>
<p>All four participated in rigorous research and demonstrated an
elite level of scholarship as participants in CSUMB&#x2019;s Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Center or UROC.</p>
<p>Rubio worked with Dr. Carolee Bull at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture&#x2019;s research station in Salinas, investigating bacterial
plant pathology. A biology major, he will attend the University of
Wisconsin for his graduate studies in plant pathology.</p>
<p>Johnson, mentored by Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan, researched
freshwater cyanobacterial algal blooms in the Monterey Bay area. A
biology major, he will enter a Ph.D. program in ecology, evolution
and marine biology at the University of California, Santa
Barbara.</p>
<p>Mentored by Dr. Susan Alexander, Ross conducted a number of
projects, including mapping bird-nesting sites and investigating
whether seabirds use smell to select mates. He is graduating with a
degree in environmental science, technology and policy, and will
attend the University of Wisconsin&#x2019;s Department of Forestry and
Wildlife Ecology.</p>
<p>Davis worked with Dr. Rikk Kvitek on mapping the California
seafloor and conducted research on invasive species at the Perry
Institute for Marine Science in the Bahamas. She will earn a degree
in marine science at CSUMB and is deciding between Oregon State
University and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for
graduate school.</p>
<p>The NSF graduate research fellowships went to 2,000 students
across the country; 850 of them were awarded to undergraduates.
With its four winners, CSUMB was the largest recipient in the
California State University&#x2019;s 23-campus system.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These fellowships do more than recognize the fantastic
achievements of our students,&#x201D; said Dr. William Head, UROC
director. &#x201C;They validate the tremendous efforts of our faculty and
campus to provide our students with world-class instruction,
research opportunities and mentoring.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to the National Science Foundation, &#x201C;The ranks of NSF
Fellows include numerous individuals who have made transformative
breakthroughs in science and engineering research, many who have
become leaders in their fields, and some who have been honored as
Nobel laureates.&#x201D;</p>
