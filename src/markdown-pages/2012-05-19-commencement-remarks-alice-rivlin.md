<p>Here is the text of remarks delivered by keynote speaker Dr.
Alice Rivlin at CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s commencement on May 19,
2012.&#xA0;Dr. Rivlin is a member of President Barack Obama&apos;s
National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, founding
director of the Congressional Budget Office and a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p><br>
I am very proud to be receiving a degree from Cal State Monterey
Bay in the company of this great looking group of graduates. And
you should be very proud of yourselves. You have worked long and
hard to be standing here in cap and gown. You have a lot more
knowledge crammed into your brains than you did when you came here.
You have acquired a lot of new skills&#x2014;both inside and outside the
classroom. Sometimes you wondered whether it was all worth
it&#x2014;staying up all night to finish that paper, struggling to
understand something that didn&#x2019;t make sense to you, wondering if
you would ever actually need that complicated formula that was so
hard to learn. But there were other moments when you suddenly
thought, &#x201C;Ah, now I get it!&#x201D; or spent hours digging into a subject
that wasn&#x2019;t assigned, just because you were fascinated by it. Those
are the great moments when the intellectual effort is its own
reward &#x2014; and there will be many more in your future.</br></p>
<p>You have done a lot of growing up here.You have met people very
different from yourselves. You have tried to listen to them and
figure out where they were coming from. You have worked together in
a team or a group or a club to make good things happen on this
campus&#x2014;whether it was winning a game or raising money for a cause
or volunteering or putting on a show. At least I hope you have,
because those teamwork and cooperative skills are going to prove at
least as useful as the facts and theories you crammed into your
heads as you move into jobs and communities and raising your own
families.</p>
<p>I stress teamwork, cooperation, and respect for each other,
because I am deeply worried that our political system is moving
rapidly &#x2014; and dangerously &#x2013; in the opposite direction. Political
discourse is increasingly strident, argumentative, and polarized.
We are not just imagining this because it is an election year.
There is plenty of evidence that political parties are more
homogeneous than they used to be &#x2014; more uniformly conservative or
liberal &#x2013; and the middle ground is disappearing. This polarization
is very clear in Congress. Republicans are more strictly
conservative &#x2014; consistently advocating less government action,
lower spending (except for defense), and lower taxes, especially
for the affluent, and less regulation. Democrats are consistent in
advocating more government action, less willing to cut spending
(except for defense), more inclined to regulation, especially of
environmental pollution and financial institutions, and more
willing to raise taxes, especially on the affluent.</p>
<p>Votes in Congress are far more partisan, even on foreign policy.
Often they are not about policy &#x2014;just about making the other side
look bad. Moderates are disappearing &#x2014; retiring or being defeated
both in primary and general elections. Compromise is a dirty word,
suggesting weakness and lack of principles. Members of congress who
work across the aisle to hammer out bipartisan positions that a
majority can support are now ostracized by their own party. It has
become essential to hold to the party line and blame the other side
for failure to solve the problem. If you listen to political
rhetoric, you hear &#x201C;blame, blame, blame&#x201D; and impugning the other
side&#x2019;s motives &#x2014; not much about working together to solve
problems.</p>
<p>This good-bad, win-lose mentality is entertaining and exciting.
It is great theatre. It is like a close football game among
traditional rivals. It is fun to shout and cheer for your side. It
adds to the excitement to pretend that the other team is a bunch of
monsters or wimps, who don&#x2019;t deserve to win. But in a game one side
wins, the other loses, and it is over. All the winner has to do is
celebrate&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t have to govern. But our nation&#x2019;s future isn&#x2019;t
a game!</p>
<p>I am not saying we should not have hard fought elections&#x2014;that is
how democracy works. But we have to be prepared to work together
across party lines when it is over. This did not happen after the
elections of 2008 and 2010. We have to make sure that 2012 is
different&#x2014;no matter who wins. Extreme polarization undermines
problem solving. The win-lose mentality is fine for sports, but a
terrible way to run a country, especially this country right now.
Under our constitution, polarization produces gridlock&#x2014;no action at
all&#x2014;and we can&#x2019;t afford gridlock. We face serious problems that
will deteriorate rapidly if we do nothing: rising public debt,
climate change, immigration, and increasing inequality&#x2014;to mention
four of the most important. These problems only get worse if we
ignore them.</p>
<p>The framers of our Constitution worked hard to craft a political
system that would protect us from authoritarian rule. They were
reacting against a powerful king, but they were also afraid of
winner take all democracy, which they called &#x201C;mob rule.&#x201D; They gave
us an elaborate structure of checks and balances to slow down
policy changes and protect the rights and views of minorities &#x2013; a
president with limited powers, two equal houses of Congress, a
Supreme Court with life terms. Any one of these power centers can
stop or slow action, and it is very unlikely that one party will
control all of them at the same time, especially when the country
is pretty evenly split down the middle as it is now. Getting things
done in our system requires negotiation and compromise. Otherwise,
we get policy paralysis&#x2014;lots of shouting and blaming, each party
painting the other as villains and scoundrels, but no action. We
hear plenty of anger, but anger is not a strategy. It doesn&#x2019;t solve
problems.</p>
<p>The example of polarization in which I have been most involved
with is our looming federal debt problem &#x2014; the challenge of how to
stabilize our rising debt without derailing the economy&#x2019;s still
fragile recovery. The problem is not is so much the current
deficit, which reflects the still far from complete recovery from
recession. The problem is that, as we look ahead, our country is on
track to borrow more every year even as the wars in the Middle East
wind down and the economy recovers. If we don&#x2019;t change policies in
a sensible way, our debt will continue to increase faster than our
economy can possibly grow. This is like your credit card debt going
up faster than your income month after month &#x2014; it is not
sustainable.</p>
<p>Now, if you listen to political speeches, you hear a lot of
blaming. D&#x2019;s blame George Bush &#x2014; for cutting taxes, expanding
Medicare benefits, starting two wars, and for allowing the
financial crisis that threw the economy into recession. R&#x2019;s blame
Barack Obama &#x2014; for spending more and cutting taxes to alleviate the
recession. But none of this blaming is actually relevant to the
reason why deficits are projected to keep rising even after the
wars wind down and the recession is over. Reason for that is huge
projected increase in older people &#x2014; the baby boom generation
retiring and living longer &#x2013; and the fact that health costs are
rising. Over the years both political parties have supported
retirement benefits and health care for seniors&#x2014;under Social
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Now the number of seniors is on
track to double and health care costs are rising &#x2014; partly because
health care is more effective than it used to be and partly because
of waste and inefficiency in our system. Those facts together,
which are neither party&#x2019;s fault, will drive spending up faster than
the economy can grow. Revenues won&#x2019;t grow that fast, so debt keeps
rising. This isn&#x2019;t a surprising problem and it isn&#x2019;t unmanageable,
we just have to figure out how to accommodate twice as many seniors
and their health care without closing down the other things we want
the government to do or bankrupting the country.</p>
<p>I served on two bipartisan commissions set up to deal with this
looming debt problem that came to the same conclusion: we have to
do two things at once. One is slow the growth of spending,
especially the growth of health care spending. The second is reform
our complex, loophole-ridden tax code so that we raise more revenue
with less drag on economic growth. We don&#x2019;t have a choice between
slowing spending growth and increasing revenues. Stabilizing the
debt requires that we do both. Moreover, we have to do both slowly
and carefully, so that we don&#x2019;t derail the recovery. Arithmetic,
not ideology, drives the solution.</p>
<p>Most of the key players in Washington actually understand this
imperative, but they can&#x2019;t bring themselves to act on it. The last
several years have seen one missed opportunity after another to get
it done &#x2014; Simpson-Bowles Commission, the Domenici-Rivlin Task
Force, the Gang of Six, the Biden group, the negotiations between
President Obama and Speaker Boehner, and most recently the
so-called &#x201C;Super-Committee,&#x201D; set up after the debt ceiling debacle
in 2011. All failed to do the job because Republicans were not
willing to take the risk of agreeing to revenue increases and
Democrats were not willing to risk agreeing to entitlement cuts. No
one wanted to make the first move and they could not figure out how
to jump together. The resulting gridlock is scary because every
delay makes the long-run problem bigger and harder to resolve.
Politicians unwilling to compromise and make difficult decisions
are taking risks with your economic future and undermining
confidence&#x2014;both here and around the world &#x2014; in the viability of our
form of government. We send young men and women to fight and
sometimes die for the idea of democracy, but we are not making our
democracy function to solve our own challenges right here at
home.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the debt is not the only big problem that requires a
bipartisan solution and will get worse if we do nothing to change
the course we are on. Climate change is probably the scariest
example. A couple of years ago we were having debates about how to
reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and cut emissions of green
house gases. Should we have a gradually rising tax on carbon or
gradually tightening controls under a cap and trade system? Now we
aren&#x2019;t even having that debate because one party is denying there
is even a problem. Immigration reform is another example. It will
take bipartisan negotiation to forge a compromise that will include
strict law enforcement and a path to citizenship for law abiding
immigrants that are already a part of our communities. Meanwhile
people suffer. Growing inequality is another problem that threatens
our future unless we face it on a bipartisan basis. All of these
challenges are manageable. But polarized politics and gridlock are
preventing us from managing them.</p>
<p>So what can you do? I think you can do a lot. Changing the tone
of political discourse has to start with public pressure on
politicians to stop the blaming and demonizing and start solving
problems. Now that you have your degree from Cal State Monterey
Bay, you can be part of this pressure wherever you are. You don&#x2019;t
have to focus on national issues, although I hope you do. So much
depends on not letting paralysis on these issues drag us down.
There are plenty of similarly polarized issues right here in
California, at both the state and local level.</p>
<p>In whatever situation you find yourself, you can make it your
business to seek out people with views different from your own,
express what you think, but listen to them; try to find some common
ground. Resist thinking of those with different ideas as the bad
guys and making them think the same of you. Go to political
meetings and challenge candidates, who are ranting about the evil
opposition. Ask them what they would actually do to solve a
problem, how their solution would work, how they would pay for it,
and how they would work with the other party to get it done.
Question simplistic solutions &#x2014; make clear you understand that
unpopular steps may have to be taken, that you value politicians&#x2019;
willingness to compromise if it moves the problem out of gridlock.
Tell them you don&#x2019;t like being pandered to, that you are willing to
bear some costs if necessary to live in a country with a
functioning problem-solving democracy that manages its challenges.
Constructive civil discourse can start with you.</p>
<p>Congratulations and good fortune in whatever you do.<br>
