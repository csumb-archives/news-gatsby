<h3>&apos;Constructive civil discourse can start with you,&apos; graduates
told</h3>
<p>On a warm, sunny morning, Dr. Alice Rivlin urged the graduates
of California State University, Monterey Bay to help end the
partisan gridlock that is paralyzing the nation&apos;s political
system.</p>
<p><img alt="Keynote speaker Dr. Alice Rivlin" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/alice_rivlin.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:200px">Dr. Rivlin, an
economist, member of President Obama&apos;s National Commission on
Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, was the keynote speaker at the university&#x2019;s
May 19 commencement.<br>
<br>
With more than 1,120 students receiving bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s
degrees, it was the largest graduating class in school history.
They received their diplomas before a capacity crowd of about 8,000
family members and friends.<br>
<br>
At a time when the political dialogue seems dominated by voices at
the extremes of the debate, Dr. Rivlin has earned a reputation as a
thoughtful problem-solver. She has worked with members of both
political parties in attempts to craft economic solutions.<br>
<br>
In her remarks, she lamented the polarization that has beset
Congress, explaining that it undermines problem solving.
&#x201C;Polarization produces gridlock . . . and we can&#x2019;t afford
gridlock,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We face serious problems that will deteriorate rapidly if we do
nothing: rising public debt, climate change, immigration and
increasing inequality &#x2013; to mention just four of the most
important.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;All of these challenges are manageable. But polarized politics and
gridlock are preventing us from managing them,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>

graduates to help solve the problem.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think you can do a lot,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Changing the tone of
political discourse has to start with public pressure on
politicians and it has to start with you.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Now that you have your degree from Cal State Monterey Bay, you can
be part of this pressure wherever you are.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Constructive civil discourse can start with you. Right now,
today.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before Dr. Rivlin&#x2019;s remarks, President Dianne Harrison conferred on
her an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.<br>
<br>
The commencement ceremony, the 16th in the university&#x2019;s history, is
the sixth and final one to be presided over by Dr. Harrison. In
June, she will assume the presidency at CSU Northridge.<br>
<br>
The ceremony opened with the traditional welcome in Spanish,
Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese, delivered by members of the
faculty.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Grads celebrate with silly string" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/silly_string.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:267px">In her remarks,
President Harrison pointed out that the graduating class &quot;boasts an
amazing pool of talent. They arrive at this day with a diverse
array of experiences, and from a wide range of backgrounds,&#x201D; she
said.<br>
<br>
She pointed out that among the graduating class are 15 veterans.
&#x201C;Located at the former site of Fort Ord, our campus is forever
linked to our nation&#x2019;s military heritage,&#x201D; she said.</br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>Dr. Harrison then introduced Caliah Hill, this year&apos;s winner of
the President&apos;s Medal for Exemplary Student Achievement. Hill, a
Human Communication major, was student government president during
the just-completed academic year.<br>
<br>
Hill presented Dr. Harrison with the first senior class gift in the
history of CSUMB, a Monterey cypress tree that will be planted on
campus.<br>
<br>
Dr. Miguel Tirado of the Department of Health, Human Services and
Public Policy was awarded emeriti faculty status, acknowledging his
distinguished service to the university.<br>
