<h4>Orbit(film) explores outer space through storytelling</h4>
<p>The Carmel Short Cinema Festival returns on June 10, sponsored
by the Forest Theater Guild and CSUMB&#x2019;s Monterey Bay Film
Society.</p>
<p><img alt="Orbit(film) will be shown in Carmel June 10" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/orbitfilm_poster.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:607px">Attendees will see
the Orbit Film Series, a project that uses the art of cinema to
inspire the art of science and education. A collaborative,
80-minute omnibus movie about the solar system, Orbit(film) is
intended for all ages. Grade-schoolers will have their interest in
art and science piqued, and older viewers will have their youthful
love of space renewed.</img></p>
<p>In the series, every planet in the solar system is represented
by a short film, each made by a different filmmaker, dealing with
the science of outer space through creative and emotional
storytelling and visual poetry. Some of the footage came from NASA,
and was reinterpreted by each filmmaker to make a portrait of a
planet. Films also cover the sun, moon and comets. Two of the
shorts were premiered at Sundance.</p>
<p>Mike Plante, creative director of the Film Society and
programmer at the Sundance Film Festival, is co-producer for the
Orbit Film Series, along with Mark Rosenberg of Rooftop Films.</p>
<p>Brent Hoff, one of the participating filmmakers, will be on
hand. His five-minute piece, Look at the Sun, is part of the
series; it is a found-footage collage of the sun that pieces
together NASA recordings to express the filmmaker&apos;s awe of this
nearest star. (See trailer below.)<br>
<br>
Tickets are $7 and can be purchased at the door. The program is
expected to start around 8:30 p.m. Spectators are advised to wear
warm clothing and may want to bring a blanket. Concessions will be
available.<br>
<br>
The Forest Theater is located at the corner of Mountain View and
Santa Rita streets near downtown Carmel. For information, <a href="http://www.foresttheaterguild.org." rel="nofollow">click

organization for independent filmmaking, media art and community

year-round programs and works to develop and support the unique
voice of the local communities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>

underserved youngsters throughout Monterey County.<br>
