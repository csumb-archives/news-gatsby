<h3>CSUMB lands $2.7 million for pre-college program</h3>

Upward Bound program will continue to soar for at least five more
years &#x2013; and better than ever.</img></p>
<p>The program &#x2013; which guides low-income and first-generation
students through the college application process &#x2013; recently
received two grants totaling $2.7 million from the U.S. Department
of Education for its next five-year cycle. One grant will continue
to fund the existing program; a second grant allows the program to
serve two more schools.</p>
<p>The existing program has served students at Soledad and
Watsonville high schools since 1999. The second grant will allow
the program to expand to Pajaro and North Monterey County high
schools.</p>
<p>About 60 students were being served each academic year; with the
expansion to Pajaro and North County, that number will double.</p>
<p>The year-round program is divided into two parts. During the
academic year, the students receive tutoring, academic advising,
college and career exploration and financial aid mentoring from
Upward Bound staff members during school visits.</p>
<p>During the six-week summer session, the students live in CSUMB
residence halls and participate in academic, social, recreational
and cultural activities.</p>
<p>In the past four years, 97 percent of Upward Bound participants
graduated from high school and 95 percent continued their
education.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Upward Bound empowers students by giving them the skills to
succeed not just in college, but in life,&#x201D; said Perry Angle, CSUMB
director of early outreach and support programs.</p>
