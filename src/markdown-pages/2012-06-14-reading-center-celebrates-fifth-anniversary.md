and illustrator Pam Carroll will be on hand as the center
commemorates five years of serving the tri-county community with an
open house from 3 to 5 p.m.</img></p>
<p>At 11 years old, Luke is already a published author. The fifth
grader&#x2019;s novel, &#x201C;Dragon Valley,&#x201D; tells the story of five dragons
scientifically spawned in a laboratory and is aimed at the pre-teen
set.</p>
<p>Carroll, a Carmel artist, is a nationally known illustrator and
painter; her work includes fanciful illustrations for children&#x2019;s
books published by Sleeping Bear Press.</p>
<p>The reading center is unique in the region. It works directly
with youngsters from kindergarten to 12th grade who have reading
difficulties, providing individualized instruction in reading and
language arts.</p>
<p>It was made possible by a $2.5 million gift from an anonymous
donor. Since it opened in 2007, more than 300 students have
received instructional assistance. In addition, the center offers
summer reading camps for youngsters and provides professional
development opportunities for teachers.</p>
<p>The center is located at Seventh Avenue and A Street on the
CSUMB campus. To RSVP for the open house, call 582-5259; for more
