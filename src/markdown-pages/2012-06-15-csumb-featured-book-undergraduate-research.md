<p><img alt="The book will be available online in June" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/book_jacket_sm.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:295px">Whether at a field
site or in a lab, the chance to conduct research is a game-changer
when it comes to earning a degree. Staff members of CSU Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center &#x2013; or UROC &#x2013;
believe that passionately, and work to offer all students that
chance.</img></p>
<p>Research, they say, can ignite a passion, build and reinforce
confidence and keep students on track for graduation and success
beyond commencement &#x2013; in graduate school or the workplace.</p>
<p>UROC was established in 2009, and since then it has earned a
national reputation for excellence, achievement and leadership.</p>
<p>As a result, Dr. Bill Head, UROC director, and Jessica Brown,
assistant director, were invited to submit a chapter for the just
published book, &#x201C;Undergraduate Research Offices and Programs:
Models and Practices,&#x201D; published by the Council on Undergraduate
Research.</p>
<p>The book features programs from a range of institutions &#x2013; large
research universities to community colleges. UROC was asked to
contribute a chapter from the perspective of a primarily
undergraduate institution.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Writing the chapter and later comparing UROC to other offices
featured in the book were exhilarating,&#x201D; Dr. Head said. &#x201C;We were
particularly struck by how unique and comprehensive UROC is.&#x201D;</p>
<p>UROC works across all academic disciplines, which, as the book
points out, only a few schools do. And students receive a wide
range of support &#x2013; from seminars on graduate school and fellowship
applications to coaching on how to present their work in public
settings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Writing the chapter enabled us to think deeply about our short
but robust history, our values and approaches, our benchmarks and
where are going,&#x201D; Dr. Head said.</p>
