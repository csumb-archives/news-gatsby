<h3>$32 million is largest grant ever received by CSUMB</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay has been awarded a 10-year, $32 million NASA
grant to continue research which includes wildfire monitoring,
agricultural water management, flood forecasting and crop yield
predictions.</p>
<p>The grant is part of a $137 million award to the Bay Area
Environmental Research Institute of Sonoma, which will collaborate
with CSUMB, UC Davis and the University of North Dakota.&#xA0;</p>

funded concerns critical areas such as basic climate processes and
how they impact global ecosystems. Some of the work will involve
satellites and unmanned drones.</img></p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s share, awarded to the university&apos;s auxiliary, University
Corporation at Monterey Bay, is $32.4 million. That&apos;s
the&#xA0;largest grant ever received by the university. It will
support 20 full-time research scientists and five to 10 student
researchers each year. Most of the scientists will work at NASA&#x2019;s
Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in Mountain View.
Collaborations with campus-based faculty members will be developed
as part of the research.</p>
<p>Dr. Susan Alexander, professor in the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy, heads the project for CSUMB.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s fantastic,&quot; Dr. Alexander said. &quot;It&apos;s very exciting to
have a 10-year commitment. Funding usually comes in one- to
three-year cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientists will study changes in ecosystems, climate and
biodiversity, and will develop products to help land managers,
agricultural producers and water managers throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Projects include wildfire and natural disaster monitoring, flood
forecasting, crop yield predictions and fog detection. Scientists
will apply satellite data to study environmental conditions and
ecological processes that affect agriculture, public health and
vector borne disease.</p>
<p>Specific areas include daily or near real-time mapping of crop
productivity and crop water demand in California; disease vectors
and disease transmission risk across the U.S.; and coral reef
health in the tropics.</p>
<p>Under the direction of Dr. Alexander, the university has
collaborated with the NASA Ames Research Center since 1997. The two
organizations conduct research in ecological and watershed systems
with an emphasis on environmental problems and issues resulting
from changing climatic and land-use patterns.</p>
<p>Graduate students in CSUMB&apos;s master&apos;s program in Coastal and
Watershed Science and Policy and advanced undergraduates in the
Environmental Science, Technology and Policy program will have the
opportunity to work with researchers at NASA Ames. They will learn
advanced geospatial technologies, conduct hands-on research
activities in earth systems science, and participate in internship
and career development programs at NASA.</p>
