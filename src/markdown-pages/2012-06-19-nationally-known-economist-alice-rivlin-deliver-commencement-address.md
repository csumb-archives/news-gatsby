<br>
&#x201C;She has played an important role in some of the most important
economic decisions affecting our country,&quot; Dr. Harrison said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Given the current economic conditions, I cannot imagine better
timing for our students to hear from Dr. Rivlin. I am confident
that our faculty and students will come away with a better
understanding of the forces shaping our future economic
outlook.&quot;<br>
