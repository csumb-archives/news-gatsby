<h3>Two CHHS students acknowledged for creative efforts</h3>

spending state taxpayer dollars, many people think they can do
better than the politicians elected to do the job. Students in Mary
Jo Zenk&#x2019;s Introduction to Nonprofit and Public Administration class
got a chance to find out.<br>
<br>
During the spring semester, she invited a representative of Next
10, a nonpartisan, nonprofit policy organization based in San
Francisco, to lead her class through an exercise involving budget
priorities, called the <a href="http://www.budgetchallenge.org/respondents/new" rel="nofollow">California Budget Challenge</a>.&#xA0;</br></br></img></p>
<p>The students had to decide how much to spend on education,
prisons and healthcare, and then they decided whether to raise or
lower taxes.<br>
<br>
As part of Next 10&apos;s public education efforts, the organization
also sponsored a contest for students to weigh in on the budget &#x2013;
in a creative way. They could submit an essay, short story, poem,
blog post, song lyric, video or comic strip explaining the choices
they think the state should make to balance the budget.<br>
<br>

students the option of entering the contest or submitting an
assignment that required them to balance the budget. About half
opted for the creative approach.<br>
<br>
Two of Zenk&#x2019;s students were among the top finishers.</br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Emily Abrahams&#x2019; letter to the citizens of the state (from
&#x201C;Governess of California&#x201D;) earned a runner-up award.<br>
<br>
It included this money-saving suggestion for balancing the budget:
&#x201C;Want to know an, um, interesting fact about this Golden State?,&#x201D;
she asked in her letter. &#x201C;We spent waaaay more money on criminal
justice than we do on education. Huh?, you may be asking. Are we a
state of outlaws? No, that&#x2019;s not it. We just need to prioritize who
should actually be in prisons.&#x201D;&#xA0;<br>
<br>
Betsaida Macias was also named a runner-up for her poem, &#x201C;Sincerity
from the Heart.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Her poem included a plea from students:</p>
<p>&#x201C;As a freshman, tuition was expensive.<br>
As a senior, it&#x2019;s become a huge expense.<br>
Budget cuts in education continue to make no sense<br>
Let&#x2019;s freeze tuition rates!&#x201D;</br></br></br></p>
<p>The winning entry was submitted by a group of students from
Presentation High School of San Francisco, who submitted an
illustrated story, &#x201C;California Budget Catastrophe.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Zenk won a $100 gift card for classroom supplies awarded to the
teacher with the most student entries.</p>
<p>She recommends that everyone try the budget challenge. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an
excellent tool to help people understand the process and the
tradeoffs,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The most exciting part for me was afterward, when some of the
students told me that the exercise has motivated them to
vote.&#x201D;&#xA0;</br></br></p>
