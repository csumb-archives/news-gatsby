<p>Dick Bower, CSUMB&#x2019;s emergency manager, has earned another
credential to add to his considerable resume.</p>
<p>The Center for Public Safety Excellence, a nonprofit
organization that helps public safety agencies improve their
services in a variety of ways, has awarded Bower the professional
designation of fire marshal. He is now one of only 3,000 fire
service professionals worldwide who hold this credential.</p>
<p>The stringent process included an assessment of his education,
experience, professional development, technical competencies,
contributions to the profession and community involvement.</p>

marshals enforce fire codes, teach fire prevention and find the
cause of destructive fires. While the designation isn&#x2019;t directly
related to his position at CSUMB, Bower said it had long been his
professional goal to earn the credential, and many of the skills
that earned him this recognition are used in his work at the
university.</img></p>
<p>Bower joined the university in late January with more than 27
years of experience in public service, including stints as a
firefighter and emergency medical technician, fire marshal, fire
chief, planning commissioner, building official and emergency
manager.</p>
<p>Most recently, he served as the building and fire safety
director and emergency management director of Gig Harbor, Wash., a
position he held for nine years.</p>
<p>He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business administration from
the University of Puget Sound and a master&#x2019;s degree in disaster
preparedness and executive fire service leadership from Grand
Canyon University.</p>
<p>In addition to certification as an emergency manager by the
International Association of Emergency Managers and code official
accreditation from the Washington Association of Building
Officials, Bower holds numerous International Code Council
certifications in building inspection and plan review.</p>
<p>He is working with the university and surrounding communities to
improve emergency preparedness at all levels.<br>
