<h3>Outdoor retailer donates $26,300 to Return of the Natives
project</h3>
<p>For the fifth straight year, CSU Monterey Bay has received a
grant from the outdoor recreation retailer REI for the university&#x2019;s
Return of the Natives (RON) project.</p>
<p>A $15,000 grant will support work with school children and local
teachers, university students and community volunteers on
habitat-restoration projects on Fort Ord public lands, the creeks
of Salinas, Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District lands and
Marina Dunes Preserve. The funds represent a stewardship grant that
REI awards annually.</p>
<p>An additional $11,300 was donated, representing the proceeds
from the Banff Mountain Film Festival screening REI sponsored in
Monterey last March.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to get people outdoors &#x2013; like REI does,&#x201D; said Laura
Lee Lienk, RON director. &#x201C;And we&#x2019;re trying to get them to realize
they can help the planet.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Ellie Kincade, outreach specialist at REI&#x2019;s Marina outlet,
commended Return of the Natives for its outreach efforts and
collaborations with the local community.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;When I came here five years ago,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;everyone I met told
me to partner with RON and Laura Lee.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The two organizations now partner regularly to support volunteer
opportunities.<br>
<br>
Return of the Natives is dedicated to bringing people closer to
nature and nature closer to people through hands-on experience in
restoring habitats.<br>
<br>
REI encourages protection and restoration of the environment
through its philanthropic activities. In 2011, the Kent,
Washington-based company gave away $4.48 million to 330 local and
national nonprofit organizations to support outdoor stewardship and
connect children to nature.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
