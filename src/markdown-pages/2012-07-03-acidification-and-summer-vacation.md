<h3>Students work on research projects</h3>
<p><em>Not too many undergraduates can say they have been fortunate
enough to do research. Even fewer can say they&#x2019;ve been a part of
research going into their junior year. And only one can say he&#x2019;s
been a part of a research project between Moss Landing Marine Labs
and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</em></p>
<p><em>My name is Alex Neu, and I&#x2019;m that student.</em><br>

<p>For some college students, summer is a time to put the books
away for a few months and kick back.</p>
<p><img alt="Mitchell Takata working at Bird Rock, Catalina Island" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/student_surveying_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height:234px">That&#x2019;s not the
case for dozens of CSU Monterey Bay students involved with the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center or UROC. Those students
&#x2013; including Alex Neu &#x2013; are spending their summers conducting
experiments, gathering data and summarizing their findings in
research papers.</img></p>
<p>They are spread out across the United States. Many are working
in labs on other university campuses and at research centers; one
is interning with a certified public accountant; and some are
working on projects based at CSUMB.</p>
<p>And while most are majoring in a field of science, at least a
dozen are pursuing degrees &#x2013; and research topics &#x2013; in psychology,
business, global studies, human communication, music and math.</p>
<p>Alex is spending the summer researching the effects of climate
change on rocky reef communities in La Jolla as part of a Sea
Grant-funded project. Among his daily activities, he monitors pH
levels in various samples.</p>
<p><img alt="Alex Neu taking a pH reading" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/alex_phreading-2_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:345px">He&#x2019;s looking at how
ocean acidification affects two species of algae, one native and
one invasive.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re excited to see what kind of results we&#x2019;ll find. Will one
species fare better than the other? What implications could this
have for an invasive species&#x2019; ability to outcompete a native in a
changing ocean environment?,&#x201D; he asks in his blog post.</p>
<p>Another UROCer, Mitchell Takata, is also spending part of his
summer down south.<br>
<br>
Takata is working with Dr. Corey Garza at the University of
Southern California&#x2019;s Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies
on Catalina Island. They are investigating the value of
incorporating intertidal habitat into the design of Marine
Protected Areas for spiny lobster and sheephead.</br></br></p>
<p>Mitchell &#x201C;has handled 4 a.m. low tide habitat surveys and 6 p.m.
and 2 a.m. high tide snorkel surveys for lobsters,&#x201D; Dr. Garza said.
&#x201C;There were even a couple of SCUBA surveys thrown in there as
well.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he&#x2019;s been a big help to the two graduate students in my
lab,&#x201D; Dr. Garza said.</p>
