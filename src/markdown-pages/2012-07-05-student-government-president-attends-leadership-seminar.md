<h3>Annual event at Panetta Institute</h3>
<p>Duane Lindsay, CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s student body president,
attended the 13th annual Student Leadership Seminar at the Panetta
Institute for Public Policy. The program was held June 17-23 on the
CSUMB campus.</p>

and behavioral sciences major from Garden Valley, was elected
Associated Students president in the spring of 2012 for the
upcoming school year.</img></p>
<p>He has been involved with student government since his first
semester on campus, when he was an active member of the Associated
Students environmental affairs committee and member of the Finance
Board. That led to being elected AS environmental senator for the
following two years (2009-2011). He has also served as residential
housing association president, as well as in other leadership roles
on campus.</p>
<p>He joined 27 other student leaders from throughout the CSU
system, Santa Clara University and Dominican University of
California at the weeklong event.</p>
<p>The objectives of the seminar, called Education for Leadership
in Public Service, are to teach leadership principles, strategies
and practices; to send the students back to their campuses and
communities as more effective leaders; and to encourage them to
pursue lives of public service.</p>
<p>Following six days of seminars and exercises, the participants
gave presentations on their personal perceptions of leadership and
their plans to apply the lessons they learned to their academic,
professional and political objectives.</p>
<p>&quot;I entered with an open mind, ready to grasp and learn from
individuals who have been leaders all of their lives,&quot; Lindsay said
at the conclusion of the seminar. &quot;The energy that surrounded and
inspired us all was extraordinary. The bonds and connections we
took away from the seminar will impact our leadership as presidents
in many ways.&quot;</p>
<p>Institute director Sylvia Panetta explained why the seminar is
important.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Today&#x2019;s young generation will one day lead our cities, states
and our nation,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They will be responsible for the future
of our communities and our economy. &#x201C;To prepare them for this work,
it is essential that they be provided with strong examples of
leadership so that they can learn and develop the skills they
require to be the strong leaders our democracy needs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The young people who attend this seminar have already
demonstrated their ambition and desire to serve. The Panetta
Institute&#x2019;s Leadership Seminar is the next step on their path to
becoming the future generation of leaders,&#x201D; Mrs. Panetta said.</p>
