<h3>&#x2028;CSU Monterey Bay participates in groundbreaking research</h3>
<p>Droughts are more than simply climate phenomena. They can have
profound social, environmental and economic impacts and can also be
a major threat to food production throughout the world. Though much
progress has been made in monitoring droughts and understanding
their causes, there is still a strong need for better forecasting
and monitoring.<br>
<br>
CSU Monterey Bay researchers John Shupe, Vanessa Genovese and Cyrus
Hiatt are joining a team of scientists from Arizona State
University, in partnership with NASA Ames and a non-profit
organization known as Planetary Skin Institute (PSI), to develop a
more efficient drought monitoring system. The work is funded by a
grant awarded by NASA&apos;s Earth Science Applications: Water Resources
program.<br>
<br>
The goal is to provide water managers, irrigation districts,
policymakers and scientists with information that will improve
drought detection, awareness and decision-making and yield cost
savings in areas of food production and hydropower
generation.<br>
<br>
The system uses satellite detection of potential water shortages
and an ecological model developed by NASA. This method offers a
cheaper alternative to costly gauge and sensor networks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The team from Arizona State will generate bi-weekly maps of an
index that reflects potential water shortages. Initial applications
will be the countries of Brazil and Mexico at 4 to 8 km resolution
and then globally at 16 to 32 km resolution. The drought maps will
be derived from satellite sensor on board the Earth Observing
System Aqua and Terra satellites.<br>
<br>
Under the direction of the CSUMB team, the NASA model has been
applied to many regions throughout the world, with particular focus
on <a href="http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/" rel="nofollow">watersheds in California</a>. On this project, the team
will continue using this model to generate 1 km resolution maps of
soil moisture, potential and actual evapotranspiration, volumetric
water content, and runoff in Brazil and Mexico. The team has
already completed global runs at 8 km. Additionally, stream flow
will be modeled on selected basins within drought-prone regions in
Brazil and Mexico.<br>
<br>
The data from both teams will be integrated into a web-based
platform called Drought ALERTS (short for Automated Land change
Evaluation, Reporting and Tracking System). This global
visualization system will overlay standard maps with scientific
datasets related to natural resources management for near-real-time
detection of water stress.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>These will be complemented with auxiliary data such as
irrigation sectors, river basins, stream networks, reservoirs,
political boundaries, temperature and precipitation, among others.
Within the platform, users will be able to query, visualize, and
plot metrics that explore the different dimensions of drought,
including the precipitation and temperature forcing and the
vegetation response. Summary statistics, such as drought duration
and intensity, will be provided to help them gauge the level of the
threat.<br>
