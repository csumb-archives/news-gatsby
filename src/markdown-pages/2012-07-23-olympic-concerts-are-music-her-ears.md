<h3>CSUMB librarian part of group performing in London</h3>
<p>Cal State Monterey Bay didn&#x2019;t land an athlete at the Olympics,
but the university will be represented in another way.</p>
<p><img alt="Sarah Dahlen" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/sarah_dehlen.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:345px">Reference and
instruction librarian Sarah Dahlen is a member of the Monterey
Peninsula Choral Society. The 113-member group will perform at
several venues in London during the Games, one of just six choirs
in the world invited to sing during the 17-day run of the
Olympics.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The choir typically has rehearsals once a week, but for the
weeks leading up to our departure, we&#x2019;ve had four each week,&#x201D;
Dahlen said. &#x201C;And I&#x2019;ve done a lot of work on my own as well, and am
usually singing in the car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The choir is scheduled to perform at Olympic Park, where as many
as 30,000 people are expected to be in the audience. The singers
will also perform at Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and
several other venues.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our repertoire includes about 25 songs and I&#x2019;ve pretty much got
all of them memorized at this point,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>The society will present a bon voyage concert July 27 at a
church in Carmel; Dahlen will leave for Paris the next morning.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re skipping the craziness of the Opening Ceremonies to sing
at a couple of venues in Paris: La Madeleine Church and
EuroDisney,&#x201D; Dahlen said.</p>
<p>The group, which also includes retired CSUMB staff member Diane
Ehlers, will take a ferry to the United Kingdom on Aug. 1, in time
to do some sightseeing before their concerts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never been to the Olympics before, but I think it&#x2019;s an
amazing event and it will be great to be around the energy of the
athletes and spectators in the park, even if we&#x2019;re not able to
attend a competition&#x201D; Dahlen said.</p>
<p>The organizers were not able to secure tickets for the large
group, but &#x201C;they made up for it by getting us tickets to see Wicked
in London&#x2019;s West End.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Most members of the group will return home on Aug. 6, but Dahlen
will head to Finland for a couple of weeks. She&#x2019;ll attend a meeting
of the International Federation of Library Associations, where
she&#x2019;s scheduled to present a workshop on using rubrics for
information literacy instruction. And then she&#x2019;s headed to Kuusamo,
37 miles south of the Arctic Circle, for a week of vacation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hoping to do some hiking there and enjoy the long daylight
hours,&#x201D; she said.</p>
