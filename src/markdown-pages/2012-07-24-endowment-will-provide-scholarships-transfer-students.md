California State University, Monterey Bay has received $500,000 in
scholarship endowment funds from the Bernard Osher Foundation of
San Francisco.<br>
<br>
The gift is part of the foundation&#x2019;s initiative for California
community college students, launched in 2008. As part of that
initiative, gifts are being made to support scholarships for
students who transfer from two-year state community colleges to a
CSU or UC campus.<br>
<br>
Starting in the 2013-14 school year, the endowment will provide
CSUMB transfer students with funds they can use for tuition, books
or living expenses.<br>
<br>
CSUMB has received previous donations from the Osher Foundation to
fund the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute on campus. The
foundation has funded a network of lifelong learning institutes
across the country to provide innovative learning opportunities to
serve the intellectual and cultural needs of older adults.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
