<p>CSU&#x2019;s Council on Ocean Affairs, Science &amp; Technology (COAST)
and CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center
have launched a summer research program that pairs students with
COAST faculty at campuses across the system.</p>

undergraduates studying science, technology and mathematics are
working with professors at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, CSU East Bay,
San Diego State and San Francisco State.<br>
During their 10-week paid internships, students are researching
topics such as the influence of temperatures on sea turtles, the
sleeping patterns of sea slugs, development of non-toxic coating
for boats and how organisms have adapted to changes in the
environment.<br>
<br>
The pilot program, which is leveraging UROC&#x2019;s Department of
Education HSI STEM and Articulation grant and COAST&#x2019;s financial
contributions, allows students to engage in research outside of the
Monterey Bay area, with costs for housing and research supplies
covered. Students were able to travel to their host CSU campus and
participate in hands-on research opportunities. Additionally,
undergraduate interns are working with &#x2013; and learning from &#x2013;
graduate students in the host labs alongside the COAST faculty
members.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;With COAST as a partner, students have been able to relocate for
the summer to more distant locations,&#x201D; said COAST Director Dr.
Krista Kamer. &#x201C;In fact, the student working with Dr. Jim Murray
from CSU East Bay traveled to Washington this summer to work at the
world-renowned Friday Harbor Labs.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
To give each student a well-rounded experience, pairings were
carefully chosen based on the students&#x2019; interest and future goals,
and faculty&#x2019;s experience and expertise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>Students, faculty mentors and research topics:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; <strong>Mark Callaghan</strong>, senior; Dr. James Murray, CSU
East Bay; Say, can you see a sea slug sleep if a sea slug could
show sleep?<br>
<br>
&#x2022; <strong>April Makukhov</strong>, sophomore; Dr. Rebecca Lewison,
San Diego State University; Hot Tub Time Machine: Influence of
Temperature on Habitat Use of East Pacific Green Sea Turtles
(Chelonia mydas) in San Diego Bay<br>
<br>
&#x2022; <strong>Lauren Tobosa</strong>, junior; Dr. Dean Wendt, Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo; Fishing and Sticking: The Impact of MPAs on
nearshore rockfish and the development of environmentally benign
marine coatings<br>
<br>
&#x2022; <strong>Carley Turner</strong>, senior; Dr. Jonathon Stillman,
San Francisco State University; The expression of temperature
responsive genes across fine-scale habitat variation in the
porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes<br>
<br>
COAST &#x2013; a network of hundreds of CSU faculty members, scientists
and students actively working to address the state&#x2019;s critical
marine and coastal issues &#x2013; has made strides in research that are
integral to the development of ocean, coast and coastal policy. In
academic year 2011-12, COAST provided $181,000 in research support
for CSU students. Scholars received the opportunity to work with
CSU faculty on marine science projects; travel across the state,
nation and world to present their findings; and participate in
summer internships with organizations dedicated to conserving
California&#x2019;s ecosystems.<br>
<br>
By providing students with hands-on experience, personal mentorship
and rich curriculum, COAST has distinguished itself as being a
resource for helping teach future scientists the skills and
knowledge they need to become assets to the community.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
