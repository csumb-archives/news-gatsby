Caroline Haskell, director of Health and Wellness Services at CSU
Monterey Bay, has been named to the Monterey County Mental Health
Commission.<br>
<br>
Fourth District Supervisor Jane Parker appointed Haskell to the
position; her term will expire in May 2013.<br>
<br>
The commission reviews and evaluates the community&#x2019;s mental health
needs, services, facilities and special problems. Commissioners act
as advocates for local mental health services, a task for which
Haskell is well prepared.<br>
<br>
A staff member at the university since 1996, she is the founding
director of the Personal Growth and Counseling Center and currently
oversees all campus health and wellness services, including the
PGCC, the campus chaplaincy, the campus Health Center, Health
Promotion and Prevention and the office of Student Disability
Resources. She provides counseling and psychological services for
students, staff and faculty and is an adjunct faculty member.<br>
<br>
Haskell earned a master&#x2019;s degree from Columbia University School of
Social Work and a B.A. in comparative literature from UC Berkeley.
She received an advanced graduate certificate in Contemplative
Clinical Practice from Smith College School for Social Work. She is
a licensed clinical social worker with the California Board of
Behavioral Science Examiners and a board certified diplomate with
the American Board of Examiners in Clinical Social Work.<br>
<br>
In 2010, Haskell received the Jay Foss Clinical Services Award. The
award is given annually to someone who, in the opinion of the
commissioners, has provided outstanding mental health services in
the local community. The award is named for the late Jay Foss, a
former member of the commission.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>In 2005, Haskell was awarded the CSUMB President&#x2019;s Medal for
exemplary service to the university and commitment to its vision.
Her campus peers nominated her for the award.</p>
