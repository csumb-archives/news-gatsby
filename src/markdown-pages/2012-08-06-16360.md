<p>As Elizabeth Romanoff (WLC &#x2019;08) nears the end of her time in
Washington, D.C., she is busy wrapping up her work with Save the
Children, a non-governmental organization that works to improve the
lives of children in need.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Elizabeth Romanoff" src="http://csumb.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/news/images/romanoff.small_.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:444px">In September,
she&#x2019;ll leave for the Slovak Republic where, through a Fulbright
Scholarship, she&#x2019;ll conduct research related to gender and women&#x2019;s
empowerment.<br>
<br>
After graduating from CSUMB, she earned a master&#x2019;s degree in public
administration with a concentration in international development
management at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in
2011.<br>
<br>
From there, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she is currently
employed as knowledge management and communications coordinator at
Save the Children.<br>
<br>
Why the Slovak Republic?<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I studied there as a high school senior,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It was my
first experience living outside the country, and it pushed me to
study World Languages and Cultures at CSUMB,&#x201D; she said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>For those needing a geography refresher, the Slovak Republic is
a landlocked country in Central Europe, bordered by the Czech
Republic, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine.<br>
<br>
She&#x2019;s convinced her work at CSUMB helped her land the
Fulbright.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My capstone project was about the empowerment of Latina
fieldworkers through their literature. It&#x2019;s relevant to the
Fulbright Scholarship because one of the methods I will use to
study women&#x2019;s empowerment in Slovakia is through women&#x2019;s
literature, so I wrote about my capstone in my Fulbright proposal,&#x201D;
she said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure that made my application more competitive, as
it showed I was capable of doing this type of research.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Administered by the U.S. Department of State since 1946, the U.S.
Fulbright Program is the county&apos;s flagship international
educational exchange program. A small number of awardees study,
teach and conduct research in more than 155 countries each
year.<br>
<br>
She&#x2019;s quick to credit her degree from CSUMB for helping lay the
groundwork for her success.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The university did an excellent job of preparing me for graduate
school, my career, and in applying for the Fulbright,&#x201D; she said.
&#x201C;At CSUMB, I increased my capacity to think critically and
increased my understanding of different cultures. I studied Spanish
and had the opportunity to live in Mexico and China while I was an
undergraduate.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
She added that the goal of the Fulbright &#x2013; mutual understanding
among cultures &#x2013; is also one of the goals of CSUMB and MIIS, &#x201C;so I
felt very confident in my ability to be a Fulbright grantee. After
learning about social justice, different cultures, countries and
languages at CSUMB and then later at MIIS, I felt like I fit into
that mold so well.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It really described who I had become.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>When the Fulbright ends in the spring of 2013, she hopes to find
another position in the field of international development.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to work to improve the lives and increase the
opportunities of those living in poverty around the world,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
