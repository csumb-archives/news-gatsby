<p>Margo Mullen continues to attract attention &#x2013; and commissions &#x2013;
with her robots.</p>
<p>The 2006 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s visual and public art
program created a pair of robots for a public art project in Santa
Cruz last summer. Her canvas: a square traffic controller box
located on a street corner. The box houses the equipment that
operates traffic signals.</p>

shows two robots, one red and the other yellow, holding hands.
Their clasped hands form a heart.</img></p>
<p>At the time, Mullen told the Santa Cruz Sentinel that the robots
were created &#x2013; literally &#x2013; in a moment of darkness, when the power
went out in her studio. She had watercolor paper, ink and a
headlamp; with those tools, she created a series of robots.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They just happened,&#x201D; she told the newspaper. Featured on her
business cards, they travel with her everywhere. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve become my
little friends.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, those &#x201C;friends&#x201D; will grace illustrations for a permanent
exhibition at the Oakland Museum of California.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I had a meeting last month, the museum people love the work and
now, together, we will be creating an interactive piece in the
Natural Science Gallery in the museum,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The gallery will be telling the story of seven different
regions in our environmentally diverse state of California,&#x201D; Mullen
said. &#x201C;The robots and I will be representing the Oakland section of
the gallery.<br>

three backgrounds and 21 characters/props for the project.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The gallery is currently closed for remodeling and is set to
re-open in 2013.</br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>For another recent project, Mullen was commissioned to create
artwork for Sacramento&apos;s annual Chalk It Up event, a fundraiser for
children&#x2019;s art education programs, held over Labor Day weekend. Her
design, featuring &#x2013; what else? &#x2013; pink and orange bots and the
words, Chalk It Up to Sacramento, will appear on T-shirts available
at the event.</p>
<p>Her work &#x2013; from buttons to magnets, cards to pillows &#x2013; is
available&#xA0;<a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/studiomargo" rel="nofollow">online</a>.&#xA0;</p>
