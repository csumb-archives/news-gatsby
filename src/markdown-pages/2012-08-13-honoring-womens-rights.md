Technology Department, and Linda Turner Bynoe, a lecturer in the
university&#x2019;s Liberal Studies Department, will speak during a panel
on education and current events.</p>
<p>Ms. Blader will talk about women who create, or have created,
art work that address environmental issues. Dr. Bynoe&apos;s topic is

joined on the panel by Sandra Fluke, the women&apos;s
health&#xA0;advocate who caused a media storm earlier this year. In
February, she&#xA0;testified before the House Democratic Steering
and Policy Committee on&#xA0;the need to provide access to
contraception, and since then has spoken&#xA0;about this and other
issues of concern to women and young people&#xA0;across news
outlets including Ms. Magazine, The New York Times,&#xA0;Washington
Post, TIME Magazine, CNN, MSNBC and network TV newscasts.</img></p>
<p>Judy Baca, a former member of the art faculty at CSUMB, will
also make a presentation. Jennifer Colby, a lecturer in Liberal
Studies, has created a time line for the conference exhibit
honoring 40 years of the women&apos;s movement. Dr. Colby was formerly
