<h2><strong>Meatless Monday returns to campus</strong></h2>
<p>If you&apos;re thinking of having a burger for lunch at CSU Monterey
Bay &#x2013; and it&apos;s a Monday &#x2013; you might want to reconsider that
choice.</p>
<p><img alt="Meatless Monday poster" height="400" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/igx_migrate/images/Meatless%20Monday.jpg" style="float:left" width="308">An initiative by Sodexo, the
university&apos;s food service provider, is highlighting meatless
options at all five campus dining locations every Monday during the
school year. They&apos;re making it easy for diners to abstain from
eating meat one day a week.</img></p>
<p>If you&apos;re a carnivore and you&apos;ve already scarfed down a double
cheeseburger, don&apos;t worry. You&apos;re not in trouble. It&apos;s
voluntary.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea isn&apos;t to take any choices away,&quot; said Tyler McBrian,
Sodexo&apos;s campus marketing and sustainability manager. &quot;The idea is
to add vegetarian options and to make them visible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sodexo is doing that by featuring a special serving station for
vegetarian fare in the Dining Commons.</p>
<p>In addition, the library caf&#xE9; features veggie hummus wraps, the
Otter Express offers veggie sandwiches and the Otter Bay Restaurant
has a new Meatless Monday option every week.</p>
<p>The company&apos;s website says it is offering more vegetarian fare
to improve students&apos; health and reduce their environmental
impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you know that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to make one
pound of beef,&quot; McBrian asks people.</p>
<p>The Meatless Monday trend is sweeping through learning
institutions from elementary to graduate schools. Pioneers include
UC Davis, Yale University and the Baltimore City schools.</p>
<p>Dozens of colleges and universities now highlight meatless
options each week, according to Sodexo. Many of the efforts to
bring Meatless Monday to campuses were student-led, a testament to
increased awareness about the connections between diet and overall
health. Each college has added its own promotion style to the
campaign, including videos, Facebook pages and pledge drives.</p>
<p>And it&apos;s not just schools that have signed on to the idea.</p>
<p>When celebrity chef Mario Batali starts to push people to eat
their vegetables, you know something is happening. The famous chef
and restaurant owner has joined the Meatless Monday movement, which
is backed by a broad array of public-health advocates.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a
study of fruit and vegetable consumption. It found that only 26
percent of adults eat vegetables three or more times a day &#x2013; which
falls far short of guidelines set by the federal government. When
it comes to fruits and vegetables, the average American eats less
than half of what public health officials suggest. And that figure
hasn&apos;t budged since 2000.</p>
<p>Nor is the idea new. During World War I, people were urged to
skip meat one day a week as a rationing effort. Now, that idea has
been reinvented as a hip, easy way to be environmentally friendly
and health conscious.</p>
