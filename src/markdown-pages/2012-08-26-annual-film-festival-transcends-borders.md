<p>The Monterey Bay Film Festival is back for its fifth year and

<p>Under the auspices of the Monterey Bay Film Society, the
festival has grown to three days and a pair of locations.</p>
<p><img alt="Terence Nance will be on hand at the Sept. 7 screening of his film" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/terence_small.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:270px">This year&#x2019;s
festival will be held Sept. 7-9. It opens with a showing of Terence
Nance&#x2019;s &#x201C;An Oversimplification of Her Beauty,&#x201D; a love story that
cleverly incorporates animated fragments into its experimental
narrative. The film will be shown at 7:30 p.m., Sept. 7, in CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater. A question-and-answer session with
the director (pictured at left) will follow the screening. General
admission tickets are $10; $5 for students and military. <a href="http://montereybayfilmfestival.com" rel="nofollow">Tickets may be
purchased online</a>.</img></p>
<p>On Saturday, Sept. 8, young filmmakers will be in the spotlight
as 15 short works &#x2013; all under 5 minutes &#x2013; will be shown starting at
1 p.m. in the World Theater. Doors open at 12:30 p.m. for this free
event.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 films were submitted by 13- to 19-year-olds. Some
came from local teenagers &#x2013; including incarcerated youth in Salinas
&#x2013; others came were throughout California. One was submitted by a
teen filmmaker in Kenya; another came from Ecuador.</p>
<p>On the evening of Sept. 8, the festival moves to the Museum of
Monterey with a 7:30 p.m. showing&#xA0;<img alt="Director Gerardo Naranjo will show his film Sept. 8" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/juan-carlos-polanco_photo_sm.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:163px">of &#x201C;Miss Bala,&#x201D;

foreign language Oscar submission. The San Francisco Chronicle has
called it &#x201C;tense and propulsive.&#x201D;</p>
