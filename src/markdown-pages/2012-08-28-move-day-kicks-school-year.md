excited students carried, dragged and wheeled their belongings into
the residence halls at CSU Monterey Bay on Aug. 24, the first day
of the three-day move-in weekend.</img></p>
<p>By the time classes start on Aug. 27, the 2,800 students who
live in residence halls on the main campus and in East Campus
housing will be settled into the rooms and apartments that will be
their home for the next year.</p>
<p>All the activity happened with the help of dozens of staff,
faculty and students who had volunteered for the Otter Welcome
Team. They directed traffic, answered questions, carried boxes and
gave directions to the new students, most of whom had parents and
siblings along to help.</p>

Ochoa greeted students and their parents on the main quad for part
of the day.</img></p>
<p>New students had a variety of reasons for choosing CSUMB, but
several themes were apparent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I came because there&#x2019;s a good program in my major, marine
science,&#x201D; said Carolyn Erickson. &#x201C;And it&#x2019;s a small school. It fit
with what I was looking for.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Erickson, who comes from Minnekonka, Minn., was amused by the
response she&#x2019;s gotten from her fellow students. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re saying to
me, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re from MINNESOTA,&#x2019; like that&#x2019;s a foreign country,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
<p>For Kyle Starling of Templeton, location was the attraction.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wanted to get away from home. CSUMB is not too far away &#x2013;
about six hours &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not too close either. This is just
right,&#x201D; said the freshman who plans to major in biology.</p>
<p>Returning student Amelia Amador was eager to get to campus from
her home in Merced. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been 100 degrees there for the last two
weeks, so I&#x2019;m not complaining about the weather here,&#x201D; she said.
The sophomore is switching majors this year from biology to
teledramatic arts and technology.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I realized I&#x2019;m more of a creative person than an analytical
one,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>The incoming class includes 885 freshmen and 643 new transfer
students. Total enrollment is approximately 5,400.</p>
