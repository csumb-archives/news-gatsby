<h3>Talks on &#x2018;what does democracy mean to you?&#x2019;</h3>
<p>Author Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston will visit Cal State Monterey
Bay on Sept. 28 as part of a series of talks around the theme,
&#x201C;What does democracy mean to you?&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/jeanne_houston2.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:169px">She will discuss
her compelling memoir about her Japanese-American internment
experience, &#x201C;Farewell to Manzanar,&#x201D; written with her husband James
D. Houston, which provides her unique perspective on this chapter
in American history.<br>
<br>
Themes running through the book include the dangers of racial
stereotyping and prejudice, the difficulty of discovering your own
identity and family relationships.<br>
<br>
Houston was 7 years old in 1942 when her family was uprooted from
their home and fishing business in Long Beach, and relocated to
Manzanar in the foothills of California&#x2019;s Eastern Sierras, taking
only the belongings they could carry. It was a time when
anti-Japanese hysteria gripped the country.<br>
<br>
Her story is a lasting reminder of how civil rights are at risk
during a national crisis.&#xA0;In her speeches, Mrs. Houston
discusses what happened to her and the state of democracy in the
United States and the world.<br>
<br>
Why does the 77-year-old Santa Cruz resident keep up the hectic
pace of speeches across the state?<br>
<br>
She told the Long Beach Press-Telegram, &quot;We must continue to
educate people, especially young people. We can&apos;t let something
like this happen again. Our country is made up of immigrants. We
have a Constitution holding us together in the United States. We
must use it to be better and to have more humanity.&quot;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>The first 50 attendees will receive a free copy of Farewell to
Manzanar. A book signing will follow the reading and
discussion.<br>
<br>
The free talk will start at 6 p.m. in the University Center
ballroom. The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue near B
Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here.</a>&#xA0;<br>
<br>
The event is sponsored by the Monterey County Free Libraries and
Cal Humanities.<br>
