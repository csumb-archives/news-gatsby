<h3>Campus support team eases transition</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay admissions counselor Louis Martin enjoys
working with veterans.</p>
<p><img alt="CSUMB has been named a &apos;veteran friendly school&apos; by G.I. Jobs magazine" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/gi_jobs.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:199px">&#x201C;They&#x2019;re the best
students to work with because they realize the value of an
education &#x2013; more so than the average 17-year-old,&#x201D; Martin said.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re intelligent and have interesting backgrounds.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Martin estimates that he works with two dozen prospective
student-veterans each semester. Some just show up on campus, others
are referred by the campus veterans services liaison, Giselle
Young. Some he meets at veterans outreach events, others are
referred by government agencies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sometimes, they&#x2019;re nervous because they&#x2019;re worried about
whether or not they&#x2019;ll fit in with younger students,&#x201D; said Martin,
who works hard to put them at ease.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I try to make them comfortable by letting them know there are a
lot of re-entry students here &#x2013; drawn by the family housing and the
child care center on campus,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He also lets them know that they may be able to earn academic
credit for the training and experience they bring from their
military service.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Once they realize that, they relax,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Martin and the other members of the campus veterans&#x2019; support
team are part of the reason CSUMB has been named a &#x201C;Military
Friendly School&#x201D; by G.I. Jobs magazine for four straight years.</p>
<p>The magazine honors the top 15 percent of colleges and
universities that are doing the most to embrace America&#x2019;s military
members and veterans as students. It polled more than 12,000
schools.</p>
<p>Among CSUMB&#x2019;s military-friendly practices are web pages with
information specifically for veterans; a designated veterans
services liaison; a Student Veterans Organization; and a campus
support team to help veterans make the transition from active duty
to an educational environment.</p>
<p>Young says her role is &#x201C;to troubleshoot various campus services.
Each office, such as housing and other support services, has a
staff member who works with veterans &#x2013; both prospective and
continuing students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This semester, CSUMB has 96 students receiving educational
benefits under the G.I. Bill, and 63 of them are receiving the new
Post 9/11 G.I. Bill benefit, which helps pay tuition as well as a
monthly housing stipend and book allowance.</p>
<p>Another 25 students are eligible for the Federal VA Dependents
Educational Assistance program as dependents of deceased or
disabled veterans. The state of California also offers a tuition
waiver to dependents of deceased or disabled veterans; 112 students
are currently using this program at CSUMB.</p>
