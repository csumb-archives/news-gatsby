<h3>CSUMB invites visitors to Shoreline Food Garden</h3>
<p>A garden that has sprung up on an empty lot on the former Fort
Ord is producing nutritious food and offering opportunities for job
training.</p>
<p>The community is invited to visit the Shoreline Food Garden on
Sept. 29. The garden is located at 249 Tenth Street in Marina, off
Imjin Parkway.</p>
<p>From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. that day, tours of the 1.5-acre garden
will be offered, along with information on organic gardening and
landscaping with native plants.</p>
<p>More than 70 varieties of flowers, herbs and vegetables are
growing in the garden, including tomatoes, basil, beans,
sunflowers, artichokes, carrots, chard, fennel, sage, quinoa and
lavendar.</p>
<p>The garden is part of the Salinas-Marina Community Food Project
and is funded by a grant from the USDA&#x2019;s National Institute of Food
and Agriculture. It is designed to help local organizations fight
hunger and to help people gain access to fresh, local organic
produce.</p>
<p>At the garden, participants in Goodwill Industries&#x2019; Shoreline
Workforce Development Service&#x2019;s culinary job-training program learn
about gardening and cooking with fresh produce.</p>
<p>Other community organizations involved with the project
include:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Hope Services, whose clients water, weed and harvest<br>
&#x2022; Marina Tree and Garden Club<br>
&#x2022; Peninsula Wellness Center, where it is part of the &#x201C;Heart
Healthy&#x201D; program<br>
&#x2022; Veterans Transition Center, whose clients work in the garden</br></br></br></p>
<p>The Community Food Project, which includes gardens in Salinas&#x2019;
Chinatown neighborhood and at Pueblo del Mar transitional housing
program in Marina, is an initiative of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Service
Learning Institute.</p>
