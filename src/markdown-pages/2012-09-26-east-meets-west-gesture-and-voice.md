<h3>CSUMB hosts theatrical dance performance by Sheetal Gandhi</h3>
<p>Nationally acclaimed choreographer and performer Sheetal Gandhi
will visit California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World
Theater on Oct. 9. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p><img alt="Sheetal Gandhi visits campus Oct. 9" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/sheetal.mac_version.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:275px">She will perform
her one-woman show, &#x201C;Bahu-Beti-Biwi&#x201D; (Daughter-in-law, Daughter,
Wife), which explores her cultural heritage as a 21st century
Californian whose life is still shaped by age-old Indian
traditions.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Bahu-Beti-Biwi&#x201D; wraps North Indian music and family characters
into a contemporary exploration that moves between humorous
portraiture and active resistance. Gandhi merges dance, singing and
the text and subtext of centuries-old North Indian women&#x2019;s songs to
move from one portrayal to another. Her characters have
conversations with each other across time and space, revealing
complex tensions around freedom and compromise, desire and longing,
duty and love.</p>
<p>The 50-minute performance is an evocative examination of the
multiple roles of women that reflects Gandhi&#x2019;s love for tradition
with her equally urgent desire to break from it.</p>
<p>The original score for the work is the product of a
collaboration with composer Joe Trapanese whose music for the stage
has been described as &#x201C;precise and evocative&#x201D; by the New York
Times.</p>

varied resume. She has toured with Cirque du Soleil, performed with
the National Dance Ensemble of Ghana, and acted on Broadway; she&#x2019;s
a percussionist with a university degree in psychology and
dance.</img></p>
