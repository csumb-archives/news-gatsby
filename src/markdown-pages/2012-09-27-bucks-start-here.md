<h3>SBDC workshop teaches small businesses how to use &#x2018;crowd
funding&#x2019;</h3>
<p>Last April, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups &#x2013; JOBS &#x2013; Act was
signed into law. It has a &#x201C;crowd funding&#x201D; amendment that changes
restrictions on how small businesses can raise capital.</p>
<p><img alt="The JOBS Act allows small businesses to tap crowd funding for capital" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/thumb.php_.jpeg" style="float:left; width:340px; height:192px">Under the original
law, a business could have a maximum of 35 investors. The JOBS Act
eliminates that cap for startups and lets entrepreneurs raise money
by tapping the potentially large crowd of small investors on the
Internet who might want to buy equity shares in a small
business.</img></p>
<p>On Oct. 18, CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Small Business Development Center
will present a workshop on crowd funding as a source of start-up
capital and how it can be put to use immediately. The free workshop
will be held from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. at the Marina library, 190
Seaside Circle.</p>
<p>The workshop will be presented by Jim White of JL White
International, Inc., a management consulting firm.</p>
<p>White has been a senior executive for a Fortune 500 company and
the CEO of another publicly held company. After leaving the
corporate world, he acquired, turned around and sold 22 companies
that operated in 43 countries and generated in excess of $1.8
billion in revenue. He holds a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in civil
engineering, an MBA, and a Ph.D. in psychology and organizational
behavior.</p>
<p>Pre-registration is required and can be done <a href="http://bit.ly/sbdcworkshops" rel="nofollow">online</a>&#xA0;or by
