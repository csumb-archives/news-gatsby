<p>Cal State Monterey Bay has been awarded a five-year, $1.1
million grant from the U.S. Department of Education to continue the
Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program at the
university.<br>
<br>
The federal program began in 1989 to provide financial support and
academic guidance to encourage and prepare under-represented,
first-generation juniors and seniors for graduate studies leading
to a doctorate.<br>
<br>
It is named in honor of Dr. McNair, an African-American and a
first-generation college student who went on to earn a doctorate in
physics.<br>
<br>
CSUMB has had a McNair Scholars Program since 2007. To date, 44
McNair Scholars have graduated from the university. Approximately
60 percent of them have gone on to pursue graduate degrees.<br>
<br>
Each year, 25 juniors and seniors are enrolled in the program. They
work with faculty mentors on research projects and summer
internships, attend lectures, workshops and seminars and receive
academic support services.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>McNair Scholar Omar Davila Jr., a senior psychology major, spent
his summer at Yale University.</p>
<p>&quot;This past summer, I stood among the nation&#x2019;s top scholars at
Yale&#x2019;s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program. My
experience at Yale galvanized my passion to become a research
professor. This experience was only possible because of the McNair
Scholars program,&quot; Davila said.</p>
<p>Psychology major Sara Banco, who is in the midst of applying to
graduate programs, shares that sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparing my graduate school applications has served to remind
me how much I owe this program and the people who run it. I could
never do what I am doing or go where I will go without the
staggering amount of support I get from them and this program.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Dr. William Head, director of the program at CSUMB: &quot;The
McNair Scholars program prepares our students for leadership roles
in research, academia, and society.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our McNair Scholars have received prestigious national
fellowships and gone on to Ph.D. programs at the UC Santa Cruz;
UCLA; Oregon State University; Utah State University; University of
Wisconsin, Madison; and many other top-tier universities across the
United States.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&apos;m thrilled to continue this legacy with our new five-year
grant.&quot;</p>
