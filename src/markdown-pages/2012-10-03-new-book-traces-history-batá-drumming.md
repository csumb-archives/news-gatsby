<p>Dr. Umi Vaughan, assistant professor of Africana Studies in
CSUMB&#x2019;s Division of Humanities and Communication, has co-authored a
book with Carlos Aldama. In it, the master and student trace the
history of bat&#xE1; drumming from Arica to Cuba to the United
States.</p>
<p><img alt="Carlos Aldama&apos;s Life in Bat&#xE1; " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/umi_sm_book_cover.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:414px">Bat&#xE1; identifies
both the two-headed, hourglass-shaped drum of the Yoruba people and
the culture and style of drumming, singing and dancing associated
with it. Aldama is one of the masters of the bat&#xE1; drum. The book,
&#x201C;Carlos Aldama&#x2019;s Life in Bat&#xE1;: Cuba, Diaspora, and the Drum,&#x201D;
recounts his life story and traces the history of bat&#xE1; culture on
its trek from Africa to Cuba and then to the United States.</img></p>
<p>For the enslaved Yoruba, bat&#xE1; rhythms helped sustain the
religious and cultural practices of a people who had been torn from
their roots. Aldama, as guardian of Afro-Cuban music and as a
Santer&#xED;a priest, maintains the link with this tradition. By sharing
his stories, Aldama and his student Dr. Vaughan bring to light the
techniques and principles of bat&#xE1; in all its aspects, documenting
the tensions of maintaining a tradition between generations and
worlds, old and new.</p>
<p>The book includes rare photographs and access to downloadable
audio tracks.</p>
<p>Aldama is omo A&#xF1;&#xE1; (sworn to the drum) and a priest of Chang&#xF3; in
the Santer&#xED;a religion. Born in Havana, he was a founding member of
Conjunto Folkl&#xF3;rico Nacional de Cuba, studying under its original
musical director, Jesus P&#xE9;rez (Oba Ilu), and later serving as
musical director himself. He has worked with the National Symphony
of Cuba, playwright Roberto Blanco, and Karl Marx Theatre director
Alex Valdez, and has performed with Adalberto Alvarez y su Son,
Lazaro Ros and Olor&#xFA;n, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba.</p>
