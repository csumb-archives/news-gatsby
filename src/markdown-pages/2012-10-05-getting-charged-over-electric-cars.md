<h3>Campus to get two electric vehicle charging stations</h3>
<p>Electric cars and plug-in hybrids were celebrated in dozens of
cities around the country in late September at National Plug In
Day.</p>
<p><img alt="National Plug-In Day was celebrated Sept. 23" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/post-top-pluginday.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:150px">One of those
celebrations took place in Santa Cruz, sponsored by the Monterey
Bay Electric Vehicle Alliance (MBEVA). It drew 600 participates,
who were able to test drive electric cars and motorcycles and learn
about the vehicles.</img></p>
<p>At the event, Cal State Monterey Bay received a certificate of
recognition for its plans to install two electric vehicle-charging
stations on campus later this year. Professor Dan Fernandez (photo
below), co-chair of the Campus Sustainability Committee, accepted
the certificate.</p>
<p>The project is an effort by Campus Planning and Development to
reduce vehicle-related greenhouse gas emissions and promote
transportation that is consistent with the American College and
University Presidents&#x2019; Climate Commitment.</p>
<p><img alt="Professor Dan Fernandez, in the center, accepts certificate" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/certificate_for_the_web.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:238px">The chargers are
primarily funded by MBEVA, using grant money from the California
Energy Commission. Approximately 40 chargers will be installed
throughout the county.</img></p>
<p>The chargers &#x2013; to be located at the Alumni and Visitors Center
and the Student Center &#x2013; will be able to accommodate modern plug-in
vehicles and will also allow access to all other electric vehicles
and motorcycles.</p>
<p>Any vehicle parked in the charging spaces will be required to
have a valid parking permit. Use of the chargers will be free.</p>
<p>Due to increased public awareness, government subsidies and
rising gas prices, the number of electric vehicles on American
roads more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2010, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. When major auto companies
began producing electric cars in 2010, the number of charging
stations skyrocketed in response. Over the course of a year, the
number of stations rose by 2,853, a 527 percent increase, according
to the EIA.</p>
<p>Electric vehicles have been driven an estimated 200 million
miles on U.S. roads, according to a study released recently by the
Sierra Club, which, along with Plug-In America and the Electric
Auto Association, organized National Plug In Day.</p>
