<h3>Weeklong campaign starts Oct. 15 at CSUMB</h3>

Oct. 15, students at Cal State Monterey Bay will join with their
peers on more than 800 campuses across the country to promote
National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week (NCAAW).</img></p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to participate in a variety
of events, all designed to reinforce personal responsibility and
respect for state laws and campus policies when it comes to the
consumption of alcohol.</p>
<p>&#x201C;NCAAW allows us to show our students here at CSUMB &#x2013;
particularly new students &#x2013; that most of their peers are not
abusing alcohol and most are making healthy and safe decisions,&#x201D;
said Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist
with CSUMB&#x2019;s campus health center.</p>
<p>The 2012 NCAAW #makeSMARTchoices campaign theme, developed by
the BACCHUS Network, contains a message of student empowerment
through decision-making that is safe and healthy. It encourages
students to <strong>S</strong>et limits; <strong>M</strong>ake a
plan; <strong>A</strong>ct to help others;
<strong>R</strong>espect&#xA0;responsible choices; and
<strong>T</strong>alk to a friend.</p>
<p>The message supports personal responsibility and practical
safety tips about avoiding excessive drinking, not driving after
drinking, and not riding with a driver who has been drinking.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These are great messages for students because they focus on
providing them with education and skill development. They allow
students to make their own informed choices,&#x201D; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>This year&apos;s activities include:</p>
<p>&#x2022; &quot;Health Fest,&#x201D; sponsored by the POWER Peer Education Program,
highlighting campus and community organizations dedicated to
helping students make safe and responsible choices. Main Quad,

<p>&#x2022; &#x201C;Meet the Greeks&#x201D; student panel sponsored by the Multicultural

<p>&#x2022; Open mic night, sponsored by the Residential Housing
Association. Starbucks in Student Center, 7-9 p.m.</p>
<p>NCAAW has grown to become the largest single event in all of
academia because students take ownership in designing and
implementing the observance for their campus communities. The week
also provides campuses the opportunity to showcase healthy
lifestyles free from the abuse or illegal use of alcohol and to
combat negative stereotypes associated with college drinking
behavior.</p>
<p>University faculty and staff members also play a vital role in
working with students to educate them about alcohol.</p>
<p>NCAAW at CSUMB is a collaborative effort ofHealth and Wellness
Services, the POWER Peer Education Program, Student Housing &amp;
Residential Life, the Residential Housing Association, Athletics,
the Student Athlete Advisory Council, Student Activities &amp;
Leadership Development, the Office of Judicial Affairs &amp;
Community Standards, University Police Department, Academic &amp;
Centralized Scheduling, Sigma Theta Psi sorority, Kappa Sigma
fraternity, the Multicultural Greek Council, Associated Students,
Otter Student Union, Sun Street Recovery Centers and the California
Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>NCAAW isn&#x2019;t the only way CSUMB works to educate students about
drinking.</p>
<p>For the last three years, a program called AlcoholEdu has been
required for all freshmen. During the summer before they start
classes at CSUMB, they must complete a web-based course that deals
with a variety of alcohol-related topics. The goal is to ensure
that students have a base of information before they arrive on
campus &#x2013; when they are exposed to alcohol and behavior patterns get
formed. Statistics indicate the program is having an impact.</p>
<p>In addition, staff members from CSUMB&#x2019;s Health and Wellness
Services conduct educational programs and campus outreach efforts
throughout the year.&#xA0;</p>
