<h3>Former Marine works to establish Veterans&#x2019; Conservation
Corps</h3>
<p>You could say that being called to active duty following the
9/11 terrorist attacks interrupted Ben Haberthur&#x2019;s education at Cal
State Monterey Bay. Or you might say that his active military
service refocused it.</p>
<p><img alt="Ben Haberthur" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ben.jpeg" style="float:left; width:140px; height:201px">Either way,
Haberthur&#x2019;s work both as a restoration ecologist and a veterans&#x2019;
advocate received a major boost recently when he was recognized
with a TogetherGreen Fellowship Award from Toyota and the National
Audubon Society.</img></p>
<p>Haberthur, who works for the Forest Preserve District of Kane
County near Chicago, will use the $10,000 grant on an effort to
encourage veterans dealing with the aftermath of their war
experiences to work with nature.</p>
<p>Haberthur comes from a military family and, as a result, moved
often during his childhood. &#x201C;I think I always had a love of nature
and the outdoors, from spending a lot of time outside growing up
and moving around to a lot of beautiful places,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He came to the Monterey Peninsula when his stepfather was
studying at the Naval Postgraduate School. He took classes at
Monterey Peninsula College before enrolling at CSUMB in Earth
Systems Science and Policy, now known as Environmental Science,
Technology and Policy.</p>
<p>A Marine Corps reservist, Haberthur was called to active duty in
February 2002 and eventually served a tour of nearly six months in
Iraq during the early stages of the war.<br>
He said he was struck by the widespread environmental destruction
promoted by the Saddam Hussein regime during the fighting.</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;They ditched and drained thousands of acres of Iraq&#x2019;s
marshlands,&#x201D; he told the Aurora Beacon News. Seeing those
environmental costs up close, he said, made him more focused on his
career goals.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hadn&#x2019;t really been that strong of a student before, but I
came back to school with a renewed sense of purpose,&#x201D; Haberthur
said.</p>
<p>Another important factor in his successful return to CSUMB were
the relationships he had formed with several faculty members. &#x201C;In
making the transition back, it was good to have some familiar faces
there to help,&#x201D; he said, including Professors Swarup Wood and Suzy
Worcester and Watershed Institute co-director Laura Lee Lienk.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know of no more deserving former student than Ben Haberthur
for this fine honor,&#x201D; Lienk said. &#x201C;About a year after his return
from Iraq, my program, Return of the Natives Restoration Education
Project, hired Ben to be a &#x2018;Weed Warrior,&#x2019; one of a few elite
students involved in community-based habitat restoration, in his
case through the removal of invasive weed species.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ben brought to every volunteer event a sense of fun and
camaraderie. I like to think that his good work in the Chicago area
may in some way have been affected by his experiences with us
coordinating &#x2018;Ice plant Pulling Olympics&#x2019; and &#x2018;Weed Geocaching&#x2019;
events in urban communities.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Haberthur said the internships he found through the Watershed
Institute and through the efforts of Bill Head of the Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Center made it easier for him to find a job
following his graduation in 2005. He looked in the Chicago region
because his wife and fellow CSUMB graduate, Jennifer Diaz
Haberthur, was from that area.</p>
<p>Haberthur has worked as a restoration technician, geographic
information systems (GIS) specialist, and a restoration
ecologist.</p>
<p>He said that his work with nature helped him recover from the
stresses of his military service; he is now hoping to open up a
similar experience to other veterans. Having received the grant, he
is working on outreach with veterans&#x2019; and military organizations in
his area to find participants in his proposed Veterans&#x2019;
Conservation Corps.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think those veterans are a great untapped resource,&#x201D; he said.
&#x201C;But it also is an activity that can really benefit the veterans,
having that kind of contact with nature.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The plan is to have the group work on restoration of a
1,131-acre forest preserve in Batavia, Ill., named in honor of
World War II veteran Dick Young.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was inspired by the story of local hero Dick Young,&#x201D;
Haberthur told the TogetherGreen organization. &#x201C;He was a World War
II Marine veteran turned conservationist who was able to overcome
all he saw on Iwo Jima to become a leader in the fight to save our
region&#x2019;s natural areas.</p>
<p>&quot;He embodied the belief that a country worth protecting is worth
preserving.&#x201D;<br>
