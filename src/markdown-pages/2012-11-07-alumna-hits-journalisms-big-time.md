<p>Christy Khoshaba has hit the big time &#x2013; journalistically
speaking.</p>
<p><img alt="Christy Khoshaba" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/christy-khoshaba.jpg" style="float:left; width:150px; height:150px">The 2011 Human
Communication major has gone from CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s student
newspaper, the <em>Otter Realm</em>, to <em>The New York Times</em>
&#x2013; and done so in just over a year.<br>
<br>
As part of her master&#x2019;s program at UC Berkeley&#x2019;s Graduate School of
Journalism, she enrolled in Digital TV and The World, a hands-on
course where students learn the basics of video production.</br></br></img></p>
<p>&#x201C;We learn about a diaspora community in the Bay Area as we learn
video skills,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Then we visit the country of that
community for a month.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This year, it was the Chinese community in the Bay Area, and
China in the summer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>During the spring semester, Khoshaba produced six short videos
on Chinese-Americans. In late May, she and three classmates
traveled to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province. There, each
student produced one video.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mine is called &#x2018;The Exam.&#x2019; Before I left, my professor worked
out an agreement with <em>The New York Times</em> video department&#x201D;
to use the work, she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Exam&#x201D; tells the story of the high-stakes entrance test all
Chinese students must take in order to attend college. Nine million
students took the most recent exam; their college acceptance is
based entirely on the results.</p>
<p>Once the video was completed, the <em>Times&#x2019;</em> Beijing
correspondent, Edward Wong, wrote an accompanying story for the
print and web editions of the paper.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I gave him my notes and information about the people in my
video and he used some of my reporting in his story. That&#x2019;s how I
became a &#x2018;contributing reporter&#x2019;,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Khoshaba&#x2019;s video was displayed prominently on the <em>Times</em>
website on June 30 and July 1. The accompanying article appeared in
the print edition on July 1.</p>
<p>She returned to the U.S. in late June and is spending the rest
of the summer in Los Angeles, interning in the fashion and
entertainment section of <em>Newsweek/The Daily Beast.</em></p>
<p>She&#x2019;ll return to Berkeley in August to complete her master&#x2019;s
degree. Then . . . who knows.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My career goal is to be a respected journalist who informs and
educates.&#x201D; And that could take her in many directions.</p>
<p>She wants to be an international reporter in the Middle East,
perhaps writing for <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Time</em> or
<em>The New York Times</em>. &#x201C;I speak Arabic, so I think that will
help tremendously,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m also interested in fashion, so it would be great to write
for magazines like <em>Marie Claire, Harper&#x2019;s</em> <em>Bazaar</em>
or <em>Vogue</em>. And, I&#x2019;m interested in hosting an entertainment
program like Showbiz Tonight or E News.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She credits her degree from CSUMB for giving her a solid
foundation for the work she&#x2019;s doing now. &#x201C;My HCom major integrated
topics such as journalism, gender studies, media studies, law,
literature, philosophy and creative writing. I enjoyed my classes
and the professors who taught them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;HCom will always have a place in my heart.&#x201D;</p>
