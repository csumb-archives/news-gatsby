<p>Cal State Monterey Bay student Jose Hernandez has received the
2012 William R. Hearst/CSU Trustees&#x2019; Award for Outstanding
Achievement.</p>
<p><img alt="Jose Hernandez" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/jose_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:350px">The Hearst award is
among the highest forms of recognition for student achievement in
the CSU. Scholars must demonstrate superior academic achievements,
community service, financial need and the ability to overcome
adversity. Many of the students have prevailed in the face of
disability, language and cultural barriers, intense personal loss
or homelessness.</img></p>
<p>Jose worked on a farm when he was 9 years old to help support
his widowed mother and four siblings. Five years later, the family
immigrated to the United States and settled in Salinas. His next
challenge was learning English so that he could achieve his dream
of attending college.</p>
<p>He has accomplished that &#x2013; he&#x2019;s in his junior year and is
majoring in collaborative health and human services with an
emphasis in social work and public health.</p>
<p>He tutors elementary school students at the Cesar Chavez Library
and works with the Building Healthy Communities organization in
East Salinas. Last February, he represented that organization at
the launch party for Lady Gaga&#x2019;s foundation, &#x201C;Born This Way,&#x201D; at
Harvard.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Jose plans to continue his education by
enrolling in a master&#x2019;s program in counseling at CSU Bakersfield so
he can serve his community and provide a better life for his
family.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My family knows that I am serious about my education and that
it is important for me to contribute to a culture of participation
in higher education,&#x201D; Jose said.</p>
<p>More than 427,000 students attend the campuses of the CSU
system. Only 23 of those students are honored with Hearst
scholarships. The William Randolph Hearst Foundation established an
endowed scholarship fund in 1984 to honor the founder of the Hearst
newspaper chain. In 1999, the foundation partnered with the CSU
Board of Trustees to supplement the endowment with contributions
from CSU Trustees and private donors.</p>
<p>Jose and the other recipients were recognized at the CSU Board
of Trustees meeting in Long Beach on Sept. 18.</p>
<p>Another recognition has come his way: On Sept. 25, Jose was
named during the Salinas City Council&apos;s &quot;City of Champions&quot; agenda
item, a time when people are acknowledged for serving the community
and for being role models.&#xA0;</p>
