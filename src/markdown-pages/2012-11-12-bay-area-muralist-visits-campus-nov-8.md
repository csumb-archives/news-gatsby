<p>John Wehrle specializes in public art, and his thought-provoking
work is a familiar sight in the San Francisco Bay area, especially
the East Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="John Wehrle served as a combat artist in Vietnam" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/vietnam_combat_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:208px">But 47 years ago,
when he was a just-commissioned lieutenant in the Army signal
corps, his subject matter was altogether different &#x2013; soldiers at
war.<br>
<br>
Wehrle was a combat artist in Vietnam, the leader of the first
group of Army artists sent to create a visual record of that war.
His paintings and drawings are part of the Army&#x2019;s permanent
collection and were featured in the 2010 exhibition Art of the
American Solider at the National Constitution Center in
Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
After his Army service and graduate school at the Pratt Institute
in New York, he found his way to San Francisco and has lived and
worked in California ever since.<br>
<br>
The community is invited to attend a free presentation by Wehrle as
the visiting artist series continues at California State
University, Monterey Bay, at 6 p.m., Nov. 8, in the University
Center. The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B
Street.<br>

creating really big art since 1975. He specializes in site-specific
public artworks; his projects include mural-size paintings for
interior and exterior walls as well as elaborate architectural
installations that combine text, painting, ceramic tile and relief
sculpture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I always liked painting and being outdoors and somehow managed to
combine the two into a viable career,&#x201D; he told the DeYoung Museum.
&#x201C;Working in the studio can be a neurotic activity. When you are
painting in public, it&#x2019;s more of a performance, albeit a slow
one.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Wehrle&#x2019;s presentation is the final event in this semester&#x2019;s
visiting artist series. It opened in September with a presentation
by installation artist Julio Cesar Morales and continues with a
talk by Bay Area artist Mildred Howard on Oct. 25.<br>
