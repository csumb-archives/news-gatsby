<p>The approach of winter can mean only one thing &#x2013; it&#x2019;s time for
another one of Warren Miller&#x2019;s cinematic homages to high-adrenaline
ski and snowboard action. Is there a better way to get stoked for
the upcoming ski season?</p>
<p><img alt="Flow State logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/flow_state_logo.jpeg" style="float:left; width:264px; height:191px">Miller&#x2019;s new film,
Flow State, will be shown at Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 15,
part of a 240-city tour of North America.</img></p>
<p>Flow State guides viewers to the top of the world&#x2019;s most
striking peaks, taking them on an exhilarating journey across the
globe to Norway, Austria, California, Switzerland and beyond. The
powder in Japan will send you scrambling to tune-up your gear, the
gravity in Telluride will have you scheduling an avalanche
refresher course, and the steeps in Alaska will drive you to push a
little harder during your next preseason workout. Winter is right
around the corner, and it is time to enter the Flow State . . .
where the mountain meets the mind.<br>
<br>
The film will be shown at 7 p.m. in the Black Box Cabaret on Fourth
Street near Inter-Garrison Boulevard. The show is free to CSUMB
students, $5 for faculty and staff, and $10 for members of the
public. Tickets are available at the door.</br></br></p>
<p>Sponsors include CSUMB Outdoor Recreation, Outdoor Adventure
Club and the Otter Student Union.</p>
