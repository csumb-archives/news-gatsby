campus on Nov. 8 for a full day of activities, including a
workshop; a concert; and a panel discussion on contemporary
American Indian identity.</img></p>
<p>At noon that day, Dr. Patti Jo King will present the day&apos;s
keynote address, &quot;Seeing Red in a Black and White World: Including
Indians in Racial Discourse.&quot; The lecture will be held in the Media
Learning Complex (Bldg. 18), Room 118.<br>
<br>
Redhouse&apos;s instrument of choice is the traditional Native American
flute because of its connection to his Navajo culture, but, in his
hands, it has anything but a traditional sound, whether he&apos;s
playing jazz, Mozart or a Christian spiritual.</br></br></p>
<p>He took a long path to the native flute. He picked it up when he
was in his 40s while working at the housing units at Fort Ord. By
then, he&apos;d learned to play a host of instruments, starting with a
different sort of flute.</p>
<p>(He has a long history with the Army base: his father was
stationed here and brought his wife from the Philippines to
Seaside, where the family was raised.)</p>
<p>&quot;I think I was 7 years old when I first started playing the
little recorders that they give in elementary school, which leads
to clarinet and then the saxophone,&quot; he told the Voice of America
in a 2009&#xA0;<img alt="Redhouse with Native American flute" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/vince_redhouse_with_native_flute.jpg" style="float:right; width:250px; height:387px">interview. &quot;So I
started playing clarinet. And then about a year after I started
playing the clarinet, I was introduced to piano lessons and then
the Beatles hit and I started playing guitar . . . .&quot;</img></p>
<p>He still plays guitar as well as saxophone, which he uses on
many songs. It gives his music a smooth jazz sound.</p>
<p>A native of Monterey, Redhouse remembers listening to Jimi
Hendrix perform at the Monterey Pop Festival from the front yard of
his parents&#x2019; home; later, he recalls listening to Steve Miller play
at Monterey Peninsula College&#x2019;s gymnasium &#x2013; where he was not
permitted inside because he was too young.<br>
<br>
Redhouse says he&apos;s on a mission for Native American music.</br></br></p>
<p>&quot;This is an instrument that connects me with my culture,&quot; he
told the Voice of America. &quot;My culture&apos;s not known for being
musical to the level of the world&apos;s standard. So what I&apos;ve done is
I&apos;ve chosen that instrument to bring attention to the Native people
and raise the level of musicianship to world class level.&quot;</p>
