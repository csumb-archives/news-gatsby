<p>In May, 2005, Army Spec. Travis Fugate was seriously injured by
a roadside bomb while on patrol in Iraq. It took out his right eye
and damaged the retina of his left, bruised his brain and crushed
the bones in his face.</p>

in the Kentucky National Guard in 2003 for the usual reasons:
patriotism, adventure, money for college. Sixteen months later, his
military service ended suddenly. A long period of rehabilitation
followed, &#x201C;learning to be blind &#x2013; learning how to participate in
society as a blind person,&#x201D; he says.</img></p>
<p>While at the Hines Blind Center near Chicago &#x2013; where veterans
receive training in skills they need to regain their independence &#x2013;
he made a decision to &#x201C;connect to education&#x201D; and reached out to
Sentinels of Freedom, an organization that provides opportunities
for veterans who have suffered severe injuries.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They made it happen for me,&#x201D; Fugate says.</p>
<p>Sentinels of Freedom has a community in Monterey; through them,
he learned about the area and the university, visited CSUMB in
August 2009 and decided to make the move.</p>
<p>People from across campus came together to meet with him &#x2013;
including the veterans&#x2019; support team, a staff member from Student
Disability Resources, an admissions counselor and faculty members
from the computer science department, his intended major.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They showed a willingness to work with me. And I didn&#x2019;t find
that at other schools,&#x201D; Fugate said. &#x201C;After that meeting, I felt
confident that CSUMB had a staff that cared about my passion and
about helping me to reach my goals. It was an easy decision to come
here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After two years at Monterey Peninsula College, Fugate
transferred to CSUMB this semester. His veterans&#x2019; benefits cover
most of his expenses; Sentinels of Freedom covers whatever else he
needs.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s an example of why the university has been named a &#x201C;Veteran
Friendly School&#x201D; by G.I. Jobs magazine for four straight years.</p>
<p>The magazine honors the top 15 percent of colleges and
universities that are doing the most to embrace America&#x2019;s military
members and veterans as students. It polled more than 12,000
schools.</p>
<p>Among CSUMB&#x2019;s military-friendly practices are web pages with
information specifically for veterans; a designated veterans
services liaison, Giselle Young; a Student Veterans Organization;
and a campus support team to help veterans make the transition from
active duty to an educational environment.</p>
<p>Young says her role is &#x201C;to troubleshoot various campus services.
Each office, such as housing and other support services, has a
staff member who works with veterans &#x2013; both perspective and
continuing students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This semester, CSUMB has 96 students receiving educational
benefits under the G.I. Bill, and 63 of them are receiving the new
Post 9/11 G.I. Bill benefit, which helps pay tuition as well as a
monthly housing stipend and book allowance.</p>
<p>Another 25 students are eligible for the Federal VA Dependents
Educational Assistance program as dependents of deceased or
disabled veterans. The state of California also offers a tuition
waiver to dependents of deceased or disabled veterans; 112 students
are currently using this program at CSUMB.</p>
<p>Fugate lives in Monterey and takes the bus to school,
accompanied by his service dog, Mr. Fess. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s got more friends on
campus than I have,&#x201D; Fugate says. &#x201C;Students who miss their dogs
back home are drawn to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s chosen a particularly difficult course of study &#x2013; computer
science with an emphasis in software engineering.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was always interested in computers, but I was intimidated by
it. But when I lost my vision, I realized there&#x2019;s this whole
community of blind and disabled people who are trying to access the
same information that I used to access before I lost my vision.
I&#x2019;ve developed a passion to serve the blind community that I&#x2019;m now
a part of,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>Before being asked, he volunteered that he uses a regular
computer and iPhone with voice output features. &#x201C;Everyone always
wants to know that,&#x201D; he says.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s planning to graduate in May 2014. And then, &#x201C;I want to do
what I can to help tech companies reach accessibility goals.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s not the only one who wants to help.</p>
<p>Says Young: &#x201C;I would like to do this 100 percent of the time.
The people who do this work are passionate about it. It&#x2019;s very
satisfying.&#x201D;</p>
