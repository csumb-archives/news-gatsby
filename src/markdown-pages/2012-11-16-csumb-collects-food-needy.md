<h3>Concertgoers donate more than half a ton of people, pet
food</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Food Bank for Monterey County loaded
hundreds of pounds of canned goods into a delivery truck parked at
Cal State Monterey Bay&apos;s World Theater on Nov. 15.</p>

1,400 pounds of people and pet food &#x2013; was collected a few days
earlier when the December People performed at the theater. To earn
a discount off the ticket price for the Nov. 10 performance, the
capacity crowd was asked to bring cans of food for people and
pets.</img></p>
<p>The drive was a collaboration between the World Theater and
radio station HIPPO 104.3 FM. The donations were given to the food
bank, the local SPCA and the Santa Cruz animal shelter.<br>
<br>
Everything from canned vegetables and soup to pasta and grains to
canned and dried dog food was collected in barrels in the lobby.
The World Theater staff separated the donations and got them ready
for pick up.<br>
<br>
The December People &#x2013; Robert Berry, Gary Pihl, Dave Medd, Mike
Vanderhule and Jack Foster &#x2013; have been dubbed a &#x201C;Christian
contemporary Spinal Tap.&#x201D; The group puts its own take on yuletide
classics &#x2013; think Led Zeppelin doing &#x201C;Silent Night&#x201D; or a Latin-fused
Santana variation of &#x201C;Deck the Halls.&#x201D;<br>

<img alt="Food for animals was also collected" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/dog_food_small.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:210px">This was the third
year the group appeared at CSUMB. &#x201C;Because of the fantastic
audience response the last two years and the success of the food
drive we launched, we brought December People back. The audience
had an enthusiastic response to the performance and the special
effects lighting show, and the food drive was a success once
again,&#x201D; said Joe Cardinalli, artistic and executive director,
University Performances and Special Events.<br>

Hunger remains a persistent reality in the area. According to a
2010 study of hunger in Monterey County, approximately 88,700
different people are served annually by the Food Bank for Monterey
County &#x2013; one-fifth of the county&#x2019;s population. Every week it serves
approximately 10,800 people.</br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
