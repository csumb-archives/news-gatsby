<p>&#x201C;By teaching, we touch the lives of other people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That simple statement explains why Javier Martinez-Cabrera
decided to be a teacher.</p>
<p><img alt="Five CSUMB students have won prestigious Noyce Scholarships" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/teaching_math.jpg" style="float:left; width:320px; height:320px">It&#x2019;s a sentiment
shared by Cindy Fowles, who decided on her career path while still
in high school. &#x201C;My math teachers were amazing and I wanted to
share that same passion with other students,&#x201D; she said.</img></p>
<p>Martinez-Cabrera and Fowles are among five CSU Monterey Bay math
majors to be awarded Robert Noyce Scholarships. Kim Margosian,
Amanda Roggow and Brenda Valencia also received the awards. All but
Roggow are seniors.</p>
<p>Funded by the National Science Foundation, the Noyce program
awards scholarships to outstanding students who are committed to
teach math once they earn a credential.</p>
<p>Martinez-Cabrera transferred to CSUMB from Cabrillo College in
Aptos, where he has worked as a math tutor for seven years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have been part of a wonderful team where I discovered that I
wanted to be a teacher. I have been inspired by teachers at
Cabrillo and at CSUMB,&#x201D; he said before naming a long list of
them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Math is a serious and challenging subject, and I want to be
part of the success of the people who face this challenge in order
to accomplish their dreams,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>CSUMB awards five scholarships per year. Math majors starting in
their junior year are eligible, as well as students in the math
credential program. Recipients &#x2013; who are chosen based on academic
record and commitment to teaching &#x2013; receive $10,000 per year for a
maximum of three years. In exchange, they agree to teach for two
years in a high-need school for every year of support they
receive.</p>
<p>Congress passed the Robert Noyce National Math and Science
Teachers Corps Act in 1990 as a tribute to the late Robert N.
Noyce, co-inventor of the computer chip and founder of Intel.<br>
