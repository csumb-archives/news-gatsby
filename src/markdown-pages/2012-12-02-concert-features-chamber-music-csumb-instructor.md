Sammons, a lecturer in the Music and Performing Arts Department,
will premiere some of his compositions on Dec. 5 at a free concert
in the Music Hall. The performance will get under way at 8
p.m.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I have an ensemble of great musicians and they&#x2019;ll be performing
pieces I wrote for my dissertation&#x201D; while a graduate student at the
University of Virginia, he said. The performers, all active chamber
musicians based in San Francisco, are <a href="http://www.mstraus.net/" rel="nofollow">Michael Straus</a>
(saxophone), <a href="http://www.danajessen.com/" rel="nofollow">Dana Jessen</a> (bassoon), <a href="http://www.kylebruckmann.com/" rel="nofollow">Kyle Bruckmann</a>
(oboe) and <a href="http://www.giacomofiore.com/" rel="nofollow">Giacomo Fiore</a> (guitar).<br>
<br>
All the pieces are audience-interactive. &#x201C;The audience is in some
way vital to the performance of each piece. The pieces literally
can&#x2019;t be performed without the audience because they&#x2019;re given a
specific role to play,&#x201D; he explained.<br>
<br>
That role varies. In a few pieces, the audience members improvise
along with the ensemble. In one, the audience becomes the score for
the ensemble. In another, a bank of sensors translates data about
the audience and the performance environment into electronic
sound.<br>
<br>
Dr. Sammons, a guitarist as well as a composer, teaches analogue
mixing and digital editing, the MPA capstone class and organizes
the MPA master class and lecture series.&#x2028;&#x2028; His music explores the
intersection of popular and classical music and the pairing of
electronic and acoustic sound, among other ideas. As a performer,
he explores multiple genres on electric guitar, classical guitar
and other instruments.<br>
<br>
Recently, Dr. Sammons was the recipient of an ASCAP Plus Award in
the concert music division.<br>
The award is given by the American Society of Composers, Authors
and Publishers and is based on the unique value of each composer&#x2019;s
catalog of original compositions as well as recent
performances.<br>
<br>
According to the organization, the grants support the growth and
development of the nation&#x2019;s musical future.&#x2028;&#x2028;This is his first
semester at CSUMB. For more information, visit his <a href="http://www.laniersammons.com/Main/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.<br>
