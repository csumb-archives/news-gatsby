<h3>CSUMB holds annual Capstone Festival Dec. 20 and 21</h3>
<p>California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s fall Capstone
Festival will be held Dec. 20 and 21 at locations around campus.
The public is invited.<br>
<br>
In order to graduate from CSUMB, all students are required to do
capstones &#x2013; research or creative projects. The projects require
students to pull together, synthesize and apply years of learning.
As part of the process, students must publicly present their
work.<br>
<br>
During the Capstone Festival, the campus takes on the feel of an
intellectual marketplace. In various locations, students in all
academic disciplines present their work. For example, biology and
kinesiology students make poster presentations; teams of business
students present strategic plans for local companies and
organizations; music students give mini recitals; and students
majoring in Teledramatic Arts and Technology screen their projects.
The film students will show their work at 1 and again at 6 p.m. on
Dec. 20 in the World Theater.<br>
<br>
For a schedule of times and locations, visit csumb.edu/capstone.
