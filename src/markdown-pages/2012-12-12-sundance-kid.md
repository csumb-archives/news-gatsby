<h3>CSUMB alum makes return trip to film festival</h3>
<p>A pair of short films made on an iPhone have put a graduate of
the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU Monterey Bay on
the stage of the most prestigious film festival in the United
States.</p>

will have two entries screened as part of the narrative short films
program at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Jan.
17-27.</img></p>
<p>The two are from a series Machoian calls Movies Made from
Home.</p>
<p>He turned to his iPhone in part because it&#x2019;s easier to use and
in part because he thought there would be less pressure with the
smaller format.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The cameras are expensive and the production itself is a big
ordeal to put together,&#x201D; he said, describing the work he and his
collaborator Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck have done over the last four
years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wanted to make a series of films that were free from
expectations and magnitude. I would just make them because I love
making films.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When he shared them with a few people, &#x201C;they seemed to really
respond to them, so that motivated me to submit to Sundance. And &#x2013;
amazingly &#x2013; they responded as well.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But he&#x2019;s not committed to the iPhone format. &#x201C;Big productions
are great and I hope to continue to work on big films. But it isn&#x2019;t
the size of the production that makes a film great or not great. It
truly has to do with the story, the pacing, and that can be done in
any format.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="pullquote">&quot;<em>Kudos to a &apos;25 New Face&#x2019; from 2010,
Robert Machoian, who has two shorts playing in the short film
program.</em>&quot;<br>
&#x2013; Filmmaker Magazine</br></p>
<p>According to a festival news release, 65 short films were
selected from more than 8,000 submissions. &#x201C;The short film section
of the 2013 festival is comprised of bold works by adventurous
filmmakers who have mastered creative ways to embody their unique
perspectives in the short form onscreen,&#x201D; said Trevor Groth,
director of programming for the festival.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The selections represent the immensely varied and dynamic
approaches to storytelling that will inspire audiences with their
huge accomplishments within a limited time frame.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Machoian, a native of King City, graduated from CSUMB in 2007,
went on to earn a master of fine arts degree from UC Davis and is
now a lecturer at Sacramento State and at UC Davis. He lives in
Davis.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s the third time in four years that CSUMB graduates have had
films shown at Sundance. In 2010, &#x201C;Charlie and the Rabbit,&#x201D; by
Machoian and fellow alum Ojeda-Beck, was selected for the short
film program. In 2011, &#x201C;Prairie Love,&#x201D; produced by 2003 graduate
Doug Mueller, was screened in the NEXT category, for innovative and
original work on a budget of less than $500,000.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I learned a lot from my first trip to Sundance,&#x201D; Machoian said.
&#x201C;One is that it&#x2019;s extremely addicting. Once you get into Sundance,
you&#x2019;re just gonna want to get in all the time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And since Sundance attracts the top filmmakers, it&#x2019;s important
&#x201C;to introduce yourself and find others with the same sensibilities
because in time we may be working on projects together or in search
of someone to do a project with.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the people you meet at Sundance are the people you should
seriously consider working with,&#x201D; he said.</p>
