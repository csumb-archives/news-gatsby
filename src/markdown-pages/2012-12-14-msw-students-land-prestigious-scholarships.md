<h3>First class of social workers to graduate in May</h3>
<p>The first graduates of Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Master of Social
Work program will cross the stage at commencement in May 2013. They
will represent the culmination of years of planning and community
support.</p>
<p>The program started with 40 students in the fall of 2010.</p>
<p><img alt="Petra Mansfield is scheduled to graduate from the MSW program in May" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mansfield_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:354px">One of those
students, Petra Mansfield, has received an $18,500 stipend through
the California Social Work Education Center program to help pay for
her final year of school. The program is designed to support social
work students who are pursuing a career in community mental health
services.</img></p>
<p>Mansfield (at left) was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. as a
teenager. After earning a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in collaborative health
and human services at CSUMB, she went to work for the Kinship
Center as a case manager.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have discovered that there is a great need for mental health
professionals in Monterey County, especially Spanish-speaking
service providers,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have observed firsthand the devastating effects of mental
illness on individuals as well as families. It&#x2019;s the reason I
became interested in pursuing a career as a social worker,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
<p>The scholarship is especially helpful since Mansfield travels
150 miles roundtrip from her home in San Ardo in southern Monterey
County to campus.</p>
<p>In addition, Mansfield received a $5,000 award through the
Mental Health Services Act (MHSA). Seven other students also
received MHSA stipends; all were chosen by a committee of
university and community members.</p>
<p>MHSA awardees are:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Janet Barajas, a third-year student who works for Monterey
County in Children&#x2019;s School Based Services<br>
&#x2022; Gina Billeci, a first-year student and CSUMB alumna<br>
&#x2022; Katelyn Bryant, who earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree and teaching
credential from CSUMB<br>
&#x2022; M. Veronica Gonzalez, an employee of Monterey County Children&#x2019;s
Behavioral Health<br>
&#x2022; Linda Rios, a CSUMB graduate who is serving an internship at
Natividad Medical Center&#x2019;s mental health unit<br>
&#x2022; Casey Swank, a graduate of UC Irvine, who works for the Community
Action Board of Santa Cruz<br>
&#x2022; Sandra Valencia, a CSUMB graduate in her third year of the MSW
program</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Barajas, Swank and Brenda Quintero-Gonzales &#x2013; all third-year
students &#x2013; also received $18,500 through the same program that
funded Mansfield.</p>
<p>Three students received $10,164 per year until they graduate
through a California Social Work Education Center program designed
to prepare social workers for careers in child welfare
services.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Angela Gomez, who works as an adoption social worker for
Monterey County&#x2019;s Department of Social and Employment
Services<br>
&#x2022; Jennifer Mendoza, who is employed as a child welfare social
worker for Monterey County<br>
&#x2022; Becky Pimentel-Sherwood, who works for Family and Children&apos;s
Services of Monterey County</br></br></p>
<p>There has long been a need for people with MSW degrees in the
region, especially those who are bilingual and bicultural. Before
the university even opened its doors in 1995, discussions were held
about establishing a social work program. A number of obstacles
intervened.<br>
<br>
But with the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, funding became
available. The Mental Health Services Act added a 1 percent tax on
personal incomes over $1 million. The money is funneled to county
mental health programs, and some is earmarked for workforce
development. The Southern Bay Mental Health and Education Workforce
Collaborative and the Monterey County Behavioral Health Division
directed funds to support development of the university&#x2019;s MSW
program.<br>
<br>
The three-year program allows students to concentrate in Behavioral
Health or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete
an internship of 1,000 hours, 250 hours per semester starting in
the second year. They will spend an academic year in each of their
internship placements.<br>
