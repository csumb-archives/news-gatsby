Festival event will feature 13 professional-quality film
productions spanning genres, including documentary, narrative and
experimental works produced by students of CSUMB&#x2019;s Teledramatic
Arts and Technology Department.</img></p>
<p>The program includes Mattieu Mauthes&#x2019; THE TOME, a comedic romp
through the daily life of a terminally-underemployed paranormal
investigator, and Renee Infelise&#x2019;s A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, a short
documentary featuring award-winning writer Dustin Lance Black
speaking passionately about his politically-charged play &#x201C;8.&#x201D;</p>
<p>J. Beau Sandoval&#x2019;s AGAINST THE ODDS is a compelling drama
exploring the tensions between a father and daughter over her right
to love whom she chooses, and Matthew DiPietro&#x2019;s THE PEOPLE WATCHER
is a short suburban thriller about a man whose park visits are
interrupted by an ominous stranger.</p>
<p>Garrett Collins&#x2019; 20 MINUTES offers an unsettling glimpse into a
dystopian future where population control occurs by lottery.</p>
<p>Leslie Juarez&#x2019;s A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS offers an intimate
portrait of a local breast cancer assistance group and Safeer
Bhombal&#x2019;s YELLOW PANTHERS documents the little-known history of the
Asian American presence in the Black Panther Movement.</p>
<p>Seleena Tesfazgi&#x2019;s HOW FAR IS HAVEN traces the perilous journey
of a young girl&#x2019;s flight across East African borders en route to
the United States, and Carolyn Janis&#x2019; gripping drama WEDNESDAY
follows another journey in which a mother&#x2019;s desperate choices on
one violent night lead her to escape with her young daughter into
an unknown and uncertain future.</p>
<p>Kirsten Clapp&#x2019;s SKINNY ON THE INSIDE is a serio-comic and
poignant tale of female body dysmorphia and courage, and Austin
Gavin&#x2019;s AT EASE, SOLDIER lovingly portrays one of our community&#x2019;s
last family-owned and operated local bars for veterans and those
who support them.</p>
<p>Lindsey Wallraff&#x2019;s documentary GIVEN AWAY FOR LOVE is a powerful
and poetic tale of self-discovery told through the voice of an
adopted young woman, and Kevin Protz&#x2019;s animated comedy NIGHT OF THE
LIVING FOOD devilishly depicts a world of genetically &#x201C;enhanced&#x201D;
fruits and vegetables running amuck in the streets.</p>

language or violence.</p>
