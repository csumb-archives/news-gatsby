<h3>CSUMB to host Startup Weekend in January</h3>
<p>Ever wonder what it takes to be an entrepreneur?&#x2028;&#x2028;CSU Monterey
Bay will be a great place to find out when the university hosts
Startup Weekend Monterey Bay Jan. 25-27.<br>
<br>
Startup Weekend will connect local entrepreneurs, developers,
designers and startup enthusiasts with mentors and resources.
Throughout the course of this 54-hour event, attendees will share
ideas, form teams and launch startups.<br>
&#x2028;<br>
&#x201C;Startup Weekend is a great, safe experience to try being an
entrepreneur,&#x201D; said organizer Mary Jo Zenk. &#x201C;This event will foster
an innovating environment for entrepreneurs to share, vet and
launch their ideas.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like six months of entrepreneurship training in a weekend &#x2013;
and there&#x2019;s no risk,&#x201D; Zenk said.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s how it works: The weekend opens with open mic pitches on
Friday, where attendees are encouraged to bring their best ideas
and inspire others to join their team. You don&apos;t have to have an
idea to attend. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as
deemed by popular vote) and then it&#x2019;s a 54-hour frenzy of business
model creation, coding, designing and market validation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>On Sunday evening, teams demonstrate their prototypes in front
of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for
critical feedback.</p>
<p>Startup veterans and mentors &#x2013; including faculty members and
local entrepreneurs &#x2013; will be on hand throughout the weekend to
provide expertise and give talks on their experiences.<br>
<br>
The Institute for Innovation and Economic Development housed at
CSUMB is organizing the event. Sponsors include the Business and
Entrepreneurship Center at Cabrillo College, the Youth
Entrepreneurship Program, the Monterey County Business Council and
the Small Business Development Center.<br>
<br>
Participants must purchase a ticket prior to the event. Before Dec.
21, tickets are $75 or $39 for college students and include meals,
