<h3>Grant one of 10 awarded nationally</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s Small Business Development Center has
received a grant to help the city of Salinas attract and create new
jobs in the wake of the closure of Capital One, a large employer in
the city.</p>
<p>Confidential assistance, training, information and networking
opportunities will be provided to new and existing businesses,
helping them access resources such as wage subsidies and training
grants that will facilitate the growth of jobs and skill
improvement.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;This grant will allow us to work directly with more nascent and
existing companies to create new jobs in the region,&#x201D; said Andrea
Nield, associate director of the SBDC. &#x201C;We are off and running,
already working with local stakeholders and the Workforce
Investment Board&#x2019;s Rapid Response Team to create jobs and
facilitate hiring of those being laid off at Capital One.&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>The Rapid Response Team includes representatives from the
California Employment Development Department, Shoreline Workforce
Development Services, the Monterey County One Stop Career Center,
the Workforce Investment Board and the Small Business Development
Center.<br>
<br>
How can the CSUMB SBDC help? By assisting local employers with
adding new employees. According to a recent study, SBDC clients
experienced six times the sales growth, and created 13 times the
jobs of average businesses (see <a href="http://www.californiasbdc.org" title="www.californiasbdc.org">www.californiasbdc.org</a>).<br>
<br>
Also, 65 percent of the center&#x2019;s clients are in the Salinas area.
Plans are to move to 106 Lincoln St., where the city will provide a
lease at $1 a year for three years.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Small Business Administration Portable Assistance Grant,
one of 10 awarded nationally, is intended to provide assistance to
small businesses in communities suffering from a major disaster or
economic hardship brought about by corporate downsizing. The UC
Merced Small Business Development Center Regional Network
(UCM-SBDC) will provide support and fiscal oversight to the project
while the CSUMB SBDC will implement the program in the Salinas
Valley.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>As part of the grant, a special projects business adviser will
be hired. The selected candidate will implement a comprehensive
SBDC action strategy to catalize job growth in the small business
community. Consultants are currently available to provide
one-on-one consulting on-site at the individual businesses or at
one of several outreach sites. All services are completely
confidential with business consulting provided free of charge.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are pleased to announce SBA funds will be used by CSU
Monterey Bay SBDC to help increase the jobs available to the
Capital One employees facing layoff,&#x201D; said Diane Howerton, regional
director of UC Merced&#x2019;s SBDC.</p>
<p>The CSUMB SBDC is a nationally accredited program, largely
funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration that operates
within the UC Merced Regional SBDC network serving Central
California.</p>
<p>As one of four CSU hosts in Central California, the CSUMB-SBDC&#x2019;s
importance to the network is demonstrated by its excellent results
in this region. Under the leadership of Andrea Nield, associate
director, the CSUMB-SBDC has generated more than $3.8 million in
capital infusion, which assisted 27 businesses to open that created
and/or retained 134 jobs.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With Ms. Nield&#x2019;s track record, the use of the Portability Grant
funds will be beneficial to the Salinas area impacted by the
closing of the Capital One facility,&#x201D; Howerton said.<br>
