<h3>CSUMB&#x2019;s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute&#xA0;brings
50-and-better folks back to school</h3>
<p>What do Gabriel Garcia Marquez, submarine canyons and the
Chinese economy have in common?</p>
<p><img alt="OLLI&apos;s spring 2013 semester gets under way Jan. 23" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/olli_thumbnail.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:259px">They are among the
classes that will be offered this semester through the Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI &#x2013; at California State
University, Monterey Bay.</img></p>
<p>OLLI continues its sixth year with a diverse range of courses
and speakers specifically geared for those 50 and better.</p>
<p>OLLI at CSU Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher
Foundation, is part of a national network that recognizes learning
and exploration have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a
fresh look at themselves, their world and the possibilities that
await them.</p>
<p>A highlight of this semester&#x2019;s offerings is a five-session class
on &#x201C;Joseph Campbell: Nature, Myth and Art,&#x201D; taught by Susan
Shillinglaw, a professor of English at San Jose State University
and scholar in residence at the National Steinbeck Center.</p>
<p>Among the course offerings are several writing classes; the
&#x201C;Good Reads&#x201D; book club; a look at human health and environmental
chemicals; the journals and art of Jo Mora; political conflict in
cinema (taught at the Carl Cherry Center in Carmel); and gender in
American culture.</p>
<p>Continuing this semester is a two-session Marine Science Series
that will cover the deep mystery of submarine canyons and the
evolution of the marine mammals of Central California. Both will be
taught by Dr. Ed Clifton, a geologist who spent his career with the
U.S. Geologial Survey.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a two-session
class, The New California: Is Real Change In Our Future? The class
will take a look at the reforms voters sought and the changes those
reforms have brought about.</p>
<p>The lineup also includes the three-session OLLI Author Series:
The Story Behind the Story, and a Friday lecture series examining
issues of our time. Both are free.</p>
<p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can
sign up for an annual membership &#x2013; which includes tuition for six
classes for $180, or four classes for $120. An all-inclusive
membership is available for $210, which includes an unlimited
number of courses. Memberships include discounts on campus events
and other benefits.</p>
