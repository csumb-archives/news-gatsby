<p>Dozens of students from Rolling Hills Middle School in
Wattsonville voluntarily spent their last week of winter break
studying algebra &#x2013; and having fun.</p>
<p>The Algebra Academy was held at the headquarters of the
Graniterock company in Watsonville from Jan. 3 through 6. On Friday
of that week, the youngsters spent the day on the campus of Cal
State Monterey Bay and then returned to Graniterock for a
graduation ceremony on Saturday.</p>
<p>CSUMB math faculty member Dr. Hongde Hu and lecturer Lorraine
O&#x2019;Shea taught the classes, assisted by four university
students.</p>
<p>The goal was to get students up to speed with standards recently
adopted by the California Department of Education that mandate
preparation in algebra. The students worked with tablet PCs
provided to CSUMB by Hewlett Packard as part of an EdTech
Innovators grant it awarded the university last year &#x2013; one of only
10 given out worldwide.</p>
<p class="pullquote"><strong>How to help</strong><br>
To support a CSUMB-staffed academic opportunity for students,
contact Executive Director of Univeristy Development Mike Mahan at
582-3366 or <a href="mailto:mmahan@csumb.edu">mmahan@csumb.edu</a>.</br></p>
<p>Graniterock CEO Bruce Woolpert and assistant general counsel
Kevin Jeffery spearheaded the academy.</p>
<p>The company has worked with Rolling Hills for four years,
sending tutors from the company to help with English, art, math and
science, as well as hosting events such as awards ceremonies for
students who get good grades.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The academy is also intended to build a strong math foundation
through hands-on activities with algebra applications in the real
world,&#x201D; Dr. Hu said.</p>
<p>Among the problems students worked on were figuring the odds of
winning a state lottery and determining why California license
plates need three letters.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, the middle school students spent time in a math
classroom where they played a game called &#x201C;Survivor: Math Camp&#x201D;
that called on the skills they learned earlier in the week. They
also got a campus tour, ate in the dining hall and learned what
steps they should follow to prepare for college.</p>
<p>Their campus visit clearly made an impression. Some indicated
the experience made them want to attend college, especially
CSUMB.</p>
<p>Rolling Hills principal Rick Ito appreciated the opportunity for
his students to participate in the program.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think the important thing is that students have seen math in
a different way,&#x201D; Ito said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just in a classroom. It&#x2019;s all
around us.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He also complimented the work of the CSUMB students.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The four teaching assistants really made a connection with the
students,&#x201D; Ito said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re a bridge between the professors and
the youngsters, and they&#x2019;ve done a great job.&#x201D;</p>
