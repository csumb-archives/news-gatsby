<h3>Feb. 10 race benefits Rape Crisis Center</h3>
<p>As publicity kicks in for the annual Together with Love 10K
race, cheerful images focusing on a bright red heart set in a black
tree are popping up around the local area.</p>
<p><img alt="Logo for 2013&apos;s Together with Love 10K race, designed by Chelsea Pyne" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/logo_small_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:303px">The artwork was
done by CSU Monterey Bay student Chelsea Pyne as part of a project
in Professor Bobbi Long&#x2019;s Digital Art and Design class.<br>
<br>
This is the third year the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center,
sponsor of the annual race that is held near Valentine&#x2019;s Day, has
worked with CSUMB to develop the art that is used in marketing
materials and on the T-shirt that goes to race participants.<br>
<br>
Students in Professor Long&#x2019;s foundation-level design class get
experience working on a &#x201C;real&#x201D; project and the MCRCC gets
high-caliber art that helps define its theme.<br>
<br>
Clare Mounteer, the agency&#x2019;s director, and Gwen Maria, a graphic
artist who has done work for the agency, made several visits to the
class to introduce the project and work with the students. Twelve
final designs were presented to the MCRCC&#x2019;s board of directors. The
board chose Pyne&apos;s work for this year&#x2019;s logo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>For more than 25 years, the race has been the biggest annual
fundraising event for the Rape Crisis Center, a nonprofit agency
that serves adults and children who have been sexually abused. It
also provides prevention education programs throughout Monterey
County.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
The MCRCC isn&#x2019;t the only community organization to benefit from the
talents of Professor Long&#x2019;s students.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;Members of her Publications Design course have been designing the
poster and marketing materials for First Night Monterey since
2003.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;These projects give students real-world experience of working with
a client and progressing through various stages of the design
process,&#x201D; said Professor Long, who has an undergraduate degree from
the University of Washington and a master&apos;s degree in fine arts
from the Basel College of Design in Switzerland.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Publication Design is not an art class &quot;where students just have a
muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you have
to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their
ideas, and you interpret that,&quot; she told the Monterey Herald
newspaper in an interview several years ago.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
&quot;This program gives students a chance to show their talents,
skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and
respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a
project.&quot;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
