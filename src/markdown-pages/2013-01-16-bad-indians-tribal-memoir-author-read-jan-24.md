read from her new book, &#x201C;Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir.&#x201D; The book,
part tribal history, part lyric, part intimate memoir &#x2013; should be
required reading for anyone interested in California Indian
history. She tells stories of her family as well as the experience
of other California Indians through oral histories, newspaper
clippings, recordings, personal reflections and poems.</img></p>
<p>The result is a work of literary art that is wise, angry and
playful all at once.</p>
<p>In the book, she says:<br>
&#xA0;&#x201C;If we allow the pieces of our culture to lie scattered in
the dust of history, trampled on by racism and grief, then yes, we
are irreparably damaged. But if we pick up the pieces and use them
in new ways that honor their integrity, their colors, textures,
stories&#x2014;then we do those pieces justice, no matter how sharp they
are, no matter how much handling them slices our fingers and makes
us bleed.&#x201D;<br>
A California native, Dr. Miranda is an associate professor of
English at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., where
she teaches creative writing, Native American literatures, poetry
and composition.</br></br></p>

of two poetry collections, Indian Cartography and The Zen of La
Llorona. Her collection of essays, The Hidden Stories of Isabel
Meadows and Other California Indian Lacunae, will be published by
the University of Nebraska Press.</img></p>
<p>The presentation will be held at 6 p.m. in Room 120 of the
