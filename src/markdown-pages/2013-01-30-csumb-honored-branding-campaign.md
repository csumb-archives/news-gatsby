<h3><br>
CASE confers Award of Excellence</br></h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay has earned an Award of Excellence from the
Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). The
competition is acknowledged to be the highest recognition a
university can receive for its work in higher education advancement
and communications.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s branding campaign, launched in fall 2012, won a
silver in the branding programs category among universities,
colleges and independent schools in the western United States.</p>
<p><img alt="Another example of the branding campaign" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/csumb_ad_campaign.jpg" style="float:right; width:168px; height:136px">The ads prepared
for the campaign have been running in local newspapers and on
websites, on a sign at the Monterey Airport, and will soon appear
as banners and posters around campus. The tagline developed as part
of the campaign, &#x201C;a place of extraordinary opportunity,&#x201D; has been
integrated into the university&#x2019;s website and other messaging.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Recognition from the major professional association in our
field represents the view of our peers,&#x201D; said George Machun,
director of communications and marketing. &#x201C;It provides another
great opportunity to enhance the university&apos;s reputation.&#x201D;</p>
