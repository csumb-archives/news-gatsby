President Dianne Harrison conferred the honorary degree of Doctor
of Fine Arts on the Carmel resident at a ceremony on campus in
recognition of his accomplishments as an innovative and
cross-disciplinary thinker.&#x2028;</img></p>
<p>&#x2028;&#x201C;This honor recognizes excellence and extraordinary achievement
in significant areas of human endeavor,&#x201D; President Harrison
said.&#x2028;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Danziger&#x2019;s career linking the sciences, humanities and the
arts embodies the interdisciplinary values integral to the Vision
of CSU Monterey Bay,&#x201D; she said.&#x2028;</p>
<p>In 1980, at age 27, he founded Sunlaw Energy Corp., reflecting
his interests in alternative energy and law. His goal was to
research, develop, demonstrate and commercialize new energy and
environmental technology.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I did not accomplish one of the most important goals I had set for
myself: to achieve in my lifetime a kind of universal prosperity
coupled with energy independence and a clean environment of the
sort we enjoy here in Monterey.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He explained that Sunlaw built and ran a real-world commercial,
unsubsidized power plant, where the air coming out was cleaner than
the air going in &#x2013; the first and still the only such plant to do
so.<br>
&#x201C;We made good-paying jobs that didn&#x2019;t cannibalize other jobs,&quot; he
said. &quot;We set an example that has yet to be equaled, and cannot be
bettered.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The company he founded and ran caused worldwide emissions and
energy consumption to be reduced by billions of tons, Danziger
said.<br>
<br>
Addressing his university audience, he added, &#x201C;The next generation
you are training will hopefully have a chance to make this kind of
performance commonplace, although partisanship is the enemy of
prosperity, energy independence, and a clean environment.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Before Danziger started Sunlaw, he was a musician and artist,
graduated from law school and worked at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory&#xA0;at California Institute of Technology.<br>
<br>
He concluded by saying, &#x201C;This university and this place we live in
is a special place of blessedness. We are singing a great song,
harmonizing with generations past and generations yet unborn.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s keep the music flowing.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
