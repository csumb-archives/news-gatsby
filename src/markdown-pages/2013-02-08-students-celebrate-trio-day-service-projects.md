<p>Feb. 23 is National TRiO Day, a day set aside to celebrate the
positive impact of federal programs that help low-income and
first-generation students enter college and earn a degree.</p>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, it&#x2019;s also a day of service to the
community.<br>

Student Support Services, students are collecting toiletries
throughout the month of February for Dorothy&apos;s Place in Salinas, a
provider of services to the homeless.<br>
<br>
&quot;It&apos;s always good to give back to the community and what better way
of doing it than to gather up everyday necessities for those in
need,&#x201D; said student and peer mentor Stephanie Solorio, who has
played a key role in planning this year&apos;s National TRiO Day at
CSUMB.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;TRiO programs do their best to reach out to those in need and to
encourage the school community to be involved and contribute,&quot; she
said.<br>
<br>
Items that are needed include toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental
floss, combs, hairbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap,
deodorant, razors and shaving cream, tissues and toilet
paper.<br>
<br>
From Feb. 8 through 22, donations can be deposited in bins located
in the Alumni and Visitors Center, the Health Center, the Student
Services Building, the Student Center, the Dining Commons, and at
the library caf&#xE9;. On Feb. 23, volunteers will deliver the items to
Dorothy&apos;s Place.<br>
<br>
Community members are also invited to participate in the drive.
Anyone who would like to contribute can contact Chloe English of
CSUMB&#x2019;s TRiO Student Support Services at 582-4451.<br>
<br>
Students in two other CSUMB-based TRiO programs are also involved
in service projects.<br>
<br>
At Watsonville and Soledad high schools &#x2013; served through the
CSUMB-based Upward Bound program &#x2013; students are collecting
toiletries to be distributed in their communities. And high school
students served by the Educational Talent Search program are
organizing a bone marrow drive on Feb. 23 at Holy Trinity Church,
803 Elm St., in Greenfield. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., people can drop
by for a cheek swab to determine if they are suitable donors.<br>
<br>
TRiO began with the Upward Bound program, started in 1964 as part
of President Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s War on Poverty. Educational Talent
Search was added the next year, and a third program, Student
Support Services, was added three years later. By the late 1960s,
the term &quot;TRiO&quot; was coined to describe these federal
programs.&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Over the years, the TRiO programs have been expanded and improved
to provide a wider range of services and to reach more students.
All are federally funded.<br>
