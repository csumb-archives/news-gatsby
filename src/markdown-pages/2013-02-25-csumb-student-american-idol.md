<h3>Singer earns ticket to Hollywood</h3>
<p><img alt="Stevie Rae Stephens" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/stephens.jpg" style="width:200px; height:200px; float:right">A bit of
encouragement from Mariah Carey helped Cal State Monterey Bay
student Stevie Rae Stephens land a ticket to Hollywood.</img></p>
<p>Stephens, a 21-year-old senior from Livermore, auditioned for
the prime-time hit program &#x201C;American Idol&#x201D; last summer in Long
Beach, one of eight sites across the country where singers tried to
earn a coveted &#x201C;golden ticket&#x201D; to the next round of
competition.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mariah ended up giving me a thumbs up offstage before my
audition and that took some of the nerves away,&#x201D; Stephens said.</p>
<p>Idol&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hollywood Week&#x201D; episodes will air Feb. 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Stephens has been singing since she was a child. Her parents
inspired her to be a performer, she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like it&#x2019;s
genetic.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Idol audition wasn&#x2019;t really something she&#x2019;d planned for. &#x201C;I
auditioned because a friend invited me to do it with them,&#x201D; she
said. &#x201C;When I learned I got a gold ticket, my first reaction was
shock.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Her favorite &#x201C;American Idol&#x201D; contestant is Kelly Clarkson,
winner of the first competition in 2002. &#x201C;She is literally my
idol,&#x201D; Stephens said. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s such an inspiration, I love her music.
I love her story.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stevens plans to pursue her education &#x2013; she&#x2019;ll graduate in May
with a degree in music recording technology and hopes to pursue a
master&#x2019;s degree &#x2013; and a performing career at the same time.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Lanier Sammons, an instructor in the recording
technology program, Stephens has an advantage over her
competitors.</p>
<p>He told the Monterey Herald: &#x201C;She understands the process of
recording from the inside. In her studies, she focuses on
microphones,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think many &#x201C;American Idol&#x201D;
contestants will know how a mic works the way she knows it,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>She&#x2019;s happy to represent her school and is appreciative of all
the support she&#x2019;s gotten.</p>
<p>On the CSUMB Facebook page, 1,083 people have &#x201C;liked&#x201D; the story
about her success. She responded with a message of
appreciation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;OK, seriously. Over 1,000 likes. You guys have no idea how much
support I feel right now,&#x201D; she wrote. &#x201C;From the bottom of my heart,
thank you.&#x201D;<br>
