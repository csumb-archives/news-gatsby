<p>Super Sunday encourages more students to enroll</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay President Eduardo Ochoa and Provost Kathy
Cruz-Uribe will be featured speakers at predominantly black
churches to spread the word about the importance of going to
college.</p>
<p>On Feb. 17, President Ochoa will address the congregation at
<a href="http://www.greatervictorytemple.org/" rel="nofollow">Greater Victory Temple</a> at 11:05 a.m. The previous
day, Dr. Ronnie Higgs, vice president for Student Affairs, will
visit the Seaside Community Seventh-Day Adventist church for a
10:50 a.m. presentation.</p>
<p>They will discuss the importance of getting a college degree for
today&#x2019;s competitive job market, when to start planning for college,
programs offered at CSUMB, financial aid and parent
involvement.</p>
<p>Following the services, staff members from CSUMB and church
education advisers will provide information on the application and
admission process, including virtual tours through CSUmentor, the
website that helps students apply for college.</p>
<p>One of the publications to be distributed during the visits is
the &#x201C;How to Get to College&#x201D; poster, which provides middle and high
school students and their parents with step-by-step information on
the path to college. Members of each congregation also will hear
about the CSU&#x2019;s Early Assessment Program, a program enabling 11th
graders to gauge their college readiness in English and math long
before applying to the CSU.</p>
<p>As the CSU system&apos;s outreach has grown, CSU staff members and
church education liaisons have continued meeting to further develop
ways to communicate with the African American community. Financial
aid workshops, distribution of college materials to sixth through
12th-grade students and their parents, and the development of a
how-to-guide for church educational advisers who work directly with
families are among the programs that have been implemented.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.calstate.edu/pa/news/2012/release/chancellor.shtml" rel="nofollow">CSU Chancellor Timothy White</a> will participate in
this year&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/supersunday/" rel="nofollow">Super Sunday</a> events when he visits a church in
Bakersfield on Feb. 17. His visit is one of 100 Super Sunday visits
organized by the CSU at predominantly African American churches all
over the state.</p>
<p>Now in its seventh year, Super Sunday is part of an educational
outreach led by the <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/externalrelations/partnerships/african-american.shtml" rel="nofollow">CSU African American Initiative</a> &#x2013; a partnership
with churches &#x2013; to increase college preparation, student enrollment
and graduation rates among African American students.</p>
