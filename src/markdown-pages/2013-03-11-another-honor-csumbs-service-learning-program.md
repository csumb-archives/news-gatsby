<h3>Most decorated service learning program in the country</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay was named to the 2013 President&#x2019;s Higher
Education Community Service Honor&#xA0;<img alt="logo for Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/03_honorroll_logo.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:300px">Roll. This
designation is the highest honor a college or university can
receive for its commitment to service learning and civic
engagement.</img></p>
<p>&#xA0;The Corporation for National and Community Service
received applications from more than 1,000 colleges and
universities. Five received the Presidential Award; 14, including
CSUMB, were named finalists.</p>
<p>In 2006, the program&#x2019;s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one
of three recipients of the top award. The university earned the top
honor again in 2011, making it the only two-time recipient of the
President&#x2019;s Award. Since the program&#x2019;s inception, CSUMB has
received the top award or has been a finalist each year; it is the
most decorated service learning program in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;I can personally attest based on my time in Washington that our
university is nationally recognized as a leader in service learning
and community engagement. Not only is service learning woven into
our curriculum, it is also part of our university&apos;s ethos of
engaging with and contributing to the betterment of our surrounding
communities,&quot; said Dr. Eduardo M. Ochoa, CSUMB president.</p>
<p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of
the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all
students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB&#x2019;s students enroll
in service learning courses, contributing more than 65,000 hours of
service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and
government agencies in the tri-county area. Service learning is an
academic department, where issues of service, diversity, social
justice and social responsibility are linked to the core
curriculum.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally
and even internationally,&#x201D; said Dr. Seth Pollack, director of
Service Learning at CSUMB. &#x201C;No other university in the country has
made as significant a commitment to developing students&#x2019; capacity
for service and social responsibility.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have a very special program, and it feels great to again be
recognized as a national leader.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The honor roll was announced March 4 at the American Council on
Education&#x2019;s annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>According to the Corporation and National and Community Service,
honorees are chosen based on a variety of criteria, including the
scope and innovation of service projects, the extent to which
service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the school&#x2019;s
commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and
measurable community outcomes as a result of the service.</p>
