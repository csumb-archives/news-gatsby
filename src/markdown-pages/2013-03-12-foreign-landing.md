<h3>TRIO student selected for Global Leaders program</h3>
<p>This summer, Jesus Garcia-Valdez will find himself in Spain, his
first trip outside of North America.</p>

Gonzales is one of 20 students nationwide selected for the Keith
Sherin Global Leaders program, named for an executive with the
General Electric Co. A scholarship will help pay for the trip.</img></p>
<p>Garcia-Valdez will spend the month of June in intensive study of
Spanish language and culture at the Pontifical University in
Salamanca and will earn college credit toward his degree in
business administration.</p>
<p>He chose to live in a residence hall with other international
students rather than live with a family. &#x201C;I would like to learn
more about the other students&#x2019; backgrounds and I would like to
compare CSUMB&#x2019;s learning environment to that of Spain&#x2019;s,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>Garcia-Valdez&#x2019;s family came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was
10. Since then, he&#x2019;s made yearly trips home to visit relatives and
friends. While he already speaks Spanish, he wants to perfect his
skills. &#x201C;And I would like to learn more about my own culture, but
from a different perspective,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I would like to know what
their traditions are.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He expects the experience will help him become more open to
other cultures and customs. &#x201C;What I hope to learn is how other
cultures differ from my own,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>Garcia-Valdez is a student in CSUMB&#x2019;s TRIO Student Support
Services program,<br>
which provides supplemental tutoring, advising, counseling and
other help to first generation, low-income college students. The
aim of the program is to help students stay in school and
graduate.</br></p>
<p>He works as a peer mentor for Educational Talent Search, a TRIO
program aimed at low-income and first-generation high school
students. It&#x2019;s his way of &#x201C;giving back to my local community,&#x201D; he
said. ETS helps students graduate from high school and get accepted
to the college or university of their choice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hope my experience serves as a motivation to other Latino
first-generation students so they take advantage of the
opportunities that are offered to us,&#x201D; Garcia-Valdez said.<br>
