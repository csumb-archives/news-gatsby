&#x201C;Disruptive Innovation in Higher Education,&#x201D; the series will focus
on the challenges&#xA0;facing higher education in an era of
increased demand, changing demographics and declining state
support.</img></p>
<p>Globalization and accelerating technological change require that
our nation raise the educational level of its citizens. To do so,
colleges and universities will need to adopt new educational
approaches and technologies to serve more students without
increased resources while maintaining quality.</p>
<p>The speaker series will bring nationally recognized leaders in
education theory, innovation and policy to campus to discuss these
issues.</p>
<p>Dr. Thrun is a professor of computer science and electrical
engineering at Stanford, where he also serves as the director of

Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>. His research focuses on robotics
and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>He is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" rel="nofollow">Udacity.com</a>, which is using the rapid increase in
the availability of high-bandwidth Internet service to experiment
with the delivery of high quality university-level education at a
low cost.</p>
<p>His talk will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater, followed
by a question-and-answer session. The World Theater is located on
Sixth Avenue near A Street. <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">Driving directions and a campus map</a>.</p>
