<h3>Clothing designer Alice Wu visits campus April 18</h3>
<p>For more than a decade, Alice Wu, half of the fashion design
team Feral Childe, has been designing original and unusual
clothing.</p>
<p><img alt="Alice Wu will visit campus April 18 as part of the Visiting Artist Series" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/wu.alice_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:263px">Wu will visit CSU
Monterey Bay on April 18 as the Visual and Public Art Department&#x2019;s
Visiting Artist series concludes for the spring semester. The
presentation will start at 6 p.m. in the University Center.</img></p>
<p>Feral Childe started in New York City, where Wu and her partner,
Moriah Carlson, met during art school. After graduation, they
started collaborating on various creative projects and found their
focus shifting to textiles and fabrics.</p>
<p>Wu and Carlson approach garments from a sculptural perspective,
resulting in clothes described as &#x201C;built rather than sewn.&#x201D; Feral
Childe is known for its original textiles, hand-finished trims, and
surprising construction details. All pieces are made with an eye to
sustainability &#x2013; from choice of fabric, printing and dyeing
treatments, to details such as buttons and trim &#x2013; and are
manufactured in New York City.</p>
<p>Collections are represented through performance, installation,
collage, film, photography and music, often in cahoots with
creative co-conspirators. Wu, who is based in Oakland and New York
City, has presented projects across the United States and
internationally, including Denmark, Japan, Qatar and Canada, in
both traditional art venues and through independent clothing
retailers.</p>
<p>The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street.
While the event is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit
fron a dispenser on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map
are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
