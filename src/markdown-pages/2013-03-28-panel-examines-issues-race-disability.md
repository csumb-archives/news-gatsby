community is invited to join a panel presentation at CSU Monterey
Bay about race and disability, and how these two identities
interact.</img></p>
<p>The Diversity Dialogue on Race and Disability will be held from
6 to 7:30 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center. Panelists and the
facilitator will encourage the audience to examine ways that race,
white privilege and racism impact work on disability issues and
inclusion.</p>
<p>Panelists include Alicia Hernandez-Sanchez of the Central Coast
Center for Independent Living; Stacey Milbern of the Berkeley
Center for Independent Living; Xgamil Campos of Purple
Communications; and CSUMB student&#xA0;Tiffany Williams. The
facilitator is Erica Padilla-Chavez of the Monterey County Health
Department.</p>
<p>The Alumni and Visitors Center is located on Gen. Jim Moore
Boulevard at Inter-Garrison Road. While the event is free, visitors
must purchase a $2 parking permit (unless they have a valid DMV
disabled parking placard and park in a disabled parking space, or
have a permit from Hartnell, Cabrillo or Monterey Peninsula
College).</p>
