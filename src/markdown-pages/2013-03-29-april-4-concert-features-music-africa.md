Band of Santa Cruz and kora player Sean Gaskell are the featured
performers.<br>
Sadza Marimba plays the danceable, joyful rhythms of Zimbabwe. The
band blends marimbas &#x2013; wooden xylophones &#x2013; drums, gourd shakers and
vocals to create music that delights and excites people of all
ages. Everyone is encouraged to participate by clapping, singing,
dancing or just listening.<br>
<br>
Writing in the Santa Cruz weekly newspaper Good Times, Claire
O&#x2019;Connor said, &#x201C;Layer upon layer of interlocking rhythms will feed
your imagination and nourish your soul. Sadza, named after the
staple food of Zimbabwe . . . will appeal to a cross-section of
musical tastes, from punks to jazz buffs.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Band members are Lanier Sammons, a lecturer in CSUMB&#x2019;s music
department, Lola Britton, Kim Dowling, Marion Brodkey, Becca
Moeller, River Smolen, Kitty Stein and Betty Weiss.<br>

playing the kora &#x2013; a 21-stringed instrument native to the Mandinka
people of West Africa &#x2013; in 2007, and traveled to Gambia a year
later to study with accomplished musicians.<br>
He released his first solo album, &#x201C;Kora Music of West Africa,&#x201D; in
March of 2012. He has performed at festivals in Gambia and Senegal,
as well as the U.S.<br>
