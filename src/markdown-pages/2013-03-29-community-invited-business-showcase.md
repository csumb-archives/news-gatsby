Business. Proceeds benefit the school&#x2019;s program fund.<br>
<br>
Mr. Verbonich is this year&#x2019;s recipient of the business leadership
award. Recognized by many as the public face of the Pebble Beach
Co., he joined the company in 1975 as manager of the Del Monte
Shopping Center. In 1988, he assumed his current position of vice
president of community affairs. In that role, he manages the
company&#x2019;s corporate donations program, serves on the AT&amp;T
Pebble Beach Charities grants committee, and as vice-president of
Pebble Beach Co. Foundation.<br>
<br>
A community leader, Mr. Verbonich serves on a long list of boards
of directors and/or committees, including Community Foundation for
Monterey County, Monterey County Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau,
Monterey County Hospitality Association, Monterey Peninsula
Foundation, Natividad Medical Foundation, United Way of Monterey
County Campaign Cabinet, and World Affairs Council.</br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>Ms. Allen will be honored for community leadership. Her career
spans more than 20 years in the not-for-profit sector. She is
currently the development director for Franciscan Workers of
Junipero Serra, whose programs include Dorothy&#x2019;s Place Hospitality
Center. The service organization provides meals, emergency shelter
and medical care to the community&#x2019;s most marginalized
residents.</p>
<p>The leadership awards were inaugurated in 2009 to recognize
community leaders who have shown a commitment to CSU Monterey Bay
and the mission of the university.</p>
<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to meet faculty members,
graduating seniors and successful alumni, and to learn more about
how the School of Business is educating students to be ethical and
effective leaders.</p>
<p>Student awards, including one for the school&#x2019;s outstanding
senior, will also be given out at the showcase.</p>
