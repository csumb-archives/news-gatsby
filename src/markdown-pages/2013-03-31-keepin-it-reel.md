<h3>Reel Work Labor Flm Festival comes to CSUMB</h3>
<p>Two evenings of film showings &#x2013; part of the 12th annual Reel
Work May Day Labor Film Festival &#x2013; will be held on the campus of
Cal State Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>The festival features films that illuminate the lives and
struggles of workers in the United States and around the world.
This year&#x2019;s theme is the growing movement of worker-run
cooperatives, which have become a vibrant part of society in
Argentina, Spain and Greece. As factories shut down, workers move
in to run them successfully on their own.</p>
<p>Other films touch on workers&#x2019; role in developing literacy in
Cuba, women&#x2019;s and LGBT rights in the workplace and creative youth
re-imaging political engagement.</p>
<p>The two programs, as well as one off campus, are sponsored by
the CSUMB chapter of the California Faculty Association.</p>
