<h3>Change: Observations on the shifting ecology of the
Sanctuary</h3>
<p>Change is the only constant in the universe. Change alone is
unchanging.</p>
<p>So said Heraclitus of Ephesus more than 2,000 years ago, and it
still holds true for the marine ecosystems of the Monterey Bay
National Marine Sanctuary.</p>

Sanctuary&apos;s annual Current Symposium, the public is invited to
learn about changes occurring throughout the sanctuary, and the
drivers of those changes, from the experts seeking to understand
them. This year&apos;s symposium will be held from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.,
Saturday, April 27, at CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s University Center.

<p>Presentation topics will include top predators, ocean chemistry,
marine mammals and geology and will conclude with insights into the
changing face of resource management in the region.</p>
