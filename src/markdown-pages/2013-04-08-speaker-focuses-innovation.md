<h3>Lumina Foundation executive visits CSUMB April 25</h3>
<p>The President&#x2019;s Speaker Series at California State University,
Monterey Bay continues April 25, when Jamie Merisotis of the Lumina
Foundation visits campus.</p>

&#x201C;Disruptive Innovation in Higher Education,&#x201D; the series focuses on
the challenges facing higher education in an era of increased
demand, changing demographics and declining state support. The
speaker series brings nationally recognized leaders in education
theory, innovation and policy to campus to discuss these
issues.</img></p>
<p>Mr. Merisotis is an expert on a wide range of higher-education
issues. He is president and CEO of Lumina Foundation, the nation&#x2019;s
largest private foundation committed solely to enrolling and
graduating more students from college. Long a champion of the idea
that higher education enhances both society and individuals, he has
worked for decades to increase educational opportunity among
low-income, minority and other historically underrepresented
populations.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, Lumina has embraced an ambitious and
specific goal: to ensure that, by 2025, 60 percent of Americans
hold high quality degrees and credentials &#x2013; up from the current
level of less than 40 percent. All of Lumina&#x2019;s efforts and
activities &#x2013; grant making, communication, evaluation, policy
advocacy and convening &#x2013; work toward achieveing that goal.</p>
<p>His talk will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater, followed
by a question-and-answer session moderated by CSUMB Provost Kathy
Cruz-Uribe. The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue near A
Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available at
csumb.edu/map.</p>

necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP before April

issues important to our community and our nation.<br>
