<h3>Free concert April 25 features master musician Pedro
Rosales</h3>
<p>The community is invited to experience Afro-Peruvian music on
April 25 at a free concert on the campus of California State
University, Monterey Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="band&apos;s logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/proyecto_lando.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:224px">The performance
features master Afro-Peruvian musician Pedro Rosales and his group,
Proyecto Land&#xF3;, an ensemble of 10 musicians and four dancers. With
elements of jazz and salsa, the group provides a colorful and
powerful swing that makes people want to dance &#x2013; and attendees will
have the chance to do just that.</img></p>
<p>The evening includes an opportunity to talk with Rosales and his
group about the music, the history of blacks in Peru, the relative
influence of Afro-Peruvian culture in the three main regions of
Peru (coast, mountain and Amazon), and the importance of black Peru
within the wider African Diaspora.</p>
<p>The performance will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Black Box
Cabaret, located adjacent to the Health and Wellness Services
building on Inter-Garrison Road and Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Best
place to park is the lot in front of Health and Wellness
Services.</p>
<p>While the concert is free, visitors must purchase a parking
permit from a machine in the lot. Driving directions and a campus
map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
