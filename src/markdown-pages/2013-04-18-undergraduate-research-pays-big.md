<h3>Three seniors, alumna earn NSF fellowships</h3>
<p>Three members of this year&#x2019;s graduating class and an alumna have
won prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate Research
Fellowships.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&apos;This is a clear indication of the world-class
education students receive at CSUMB.&apos;<br>
<em>&#x2013; Dr. Bill Head</em></br></p>
<p>Michael Diaz of Upland, Liz Lopez of Sacramento, Emily Roncase
of Ridgecrest and Stacy Mauzey of Salinas, were awarded the
fellowships, which provide $90,000 to support three years of
graduate education.</p>
<p>All four participated in rigorous research and demonstrated an
elite level of scholarship while at CSUMB.</p>
<p>Diaz, mentored by Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan, researched potentially
toxic cynaobacteria from local freshwater environments. He also
investigated stomach bacteria pathogensis at UC Santa Cruz. A
biology major, he will begin work on his Ph.D. in the cellular and
molecular biosciences program at UC Irvine in the fall.</p>

James Lindholm, Lopez worked on a project to monitor Marine
Protected Areas along the Southern California coast and also
conducted research at Oregon State University&#x2019;s Hatfield Marine
Science Center. She is considering graduate programs at the
University of San Diego, Western Washington University and Oregon
State.</img></p>
<p>Roncase, a biology major, worked with Drs. Henrik Kibak and
Aparna Sreenivasan to investigate cyanotoxin levels in a freshwater
lake in Watsonville. She also worked at the University of Illinois
at Chicago, researching antibiotic resistance at the molecular
level. She is considering offers from a number of doctoral
programs, including Scripps Research Institute and Brown
University.</p>
<p>Mauzey, an alumna of Hartnell College and CSUMB, is now a
graduate student in plant pathology at Washington State University.
While at CSUMB, she worked with Dr. Carolee Bull in the USDA&#x2019;s
Agricultural Research Service facility in Salinas.</p>
<p>The NSF graduate research fellowships went to 2,000 students &#x2013;
from more than 13,000 applicants &#x2013; across the country; 595 of them
were awarded to undergraduates. CSUMB was the largest recipient of
undergraduate awards in the California State University&#x2019;s 23-campus
system.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nine CSUMB undergraduates and one alumna have received NSF
fellowships in the last four years,&#x201D; said Dr. Bill Head, director
of the university&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center.
&#x201C;This is a clear indication of the world-class education students
receive at CSUMB and a reminder of how well public institutions
serve the students of California.&#x201D;</p>
