<h3><br>
Electric vehicle charging stations among transportation
improvements</br></h3>
<p>Drivers of electric vehicles can zap their rides at CSU Monterey
Bay, and it&#x2019;s as easy as plugging in a toaster.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Nissan Leaf" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/nissan_leaf.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:225px">The university has
installed two electric vehicle &#x2013; EV, in car lingo &#x2013; charging
stations on campus, accessible by the CSUMB community and the
public.<br>
<br>
The project is an effort by Campus Planning and Development to
reduce vehicle-related greenhouse gas emissions and promote
transportation that is consistent with the American College and
University Presidents&#x2019; Climate Commitment.</br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;People on campus love them,&#x201D; says Megan Tolbert, the
university&#x2019;s transportation planner. &#x201C;We are averaging over three
charging sessions per day.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
One station is located on Fourth Avenue, behind the Alumni and
Visitors Center. The other can be found in the lot adjacent to the
Student Center. Both can charge two vehicles &#x2013; cars, motorcycles,
electric bikes &#x2013; simultaneously.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Electric motorcycles can charge up on campus" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/electric_motorcycle_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:275px; height:361px">The spaces are
available on a first-come, first-served basis. Vehicles must
display a university parking permit.<br>
<br>
Drivers can sign up for a <a href="http://chargepoint.com/chargepointnet/how-sign-up.php" rel="nofollow">ChargePoint access card</a>&#xA0;or they can use a
credit card (except Discover cards) to open the locked door to the
charger connection. The service is free, but a card is necessary to
access the connection.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&apos;s chargers provide a J1772 240 volt connection as well as a
110 volt standard electrical outlet so that any type of electrified
vehicle can get a charge. While standard outlets will suffice for
charging an electric vehicle, they&#x2019;re slow for higher performance
freeway-speed vehicles. The J1772 charging station connector can
fill up an entire battery pack in a matter of hours rather than
overnight, although most EV&apos;s on campus don&apos;t need a full
charge.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The CSUMB charging units are quite robust,&#x201D; says Marc Oehlman,
associate director of the Center for Academic Technologies and a
Nissan Leaf driver who uses the stations daily. &#x201C;They carry a
better flow of power than other Level 2 units I have used.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Oehlman says he typically gets 70 to 80 miles on a charge, assuming
a driving speed of 55 to 60 miles per hour. But, like other cars,
that can be reduced if the windows are open or the air conditioner
is used.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Your driving habits on longer distances need to change, and to
a certain extent, in everyday driving as well,&#x201D; Oehlman says. &#x201C;But
it&#x2019;s well worth it to drive by a dinogas store.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tolbert points out that no matter what kind of car you drive,
your driving habits make the biggest difference for fuel economy,
cost and pollution.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&#x2019;s charging stations were largely funded by the Monterey Bay
Electric Vehicle Alliance, using grant money from the California
Energy Commission. CSUMB provided about 20 percent of the cost of
installation. They are part of a plan to install 40 charging
stations throughout Monterey County.<br>
<br>
Due to increased public awareness, government subsidies and rising
gas prices, the number of electric vehicles on American roads more
than quadrupled between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. When major automakers began producing
electric cars in 2010, the number of charging stations skyrocketed
in response. Over the course of a year, the number of stations rose
by 2,853, a 527 percent increase, according to the EIA.<br>
<br>
Other campus transportation-related projects have come online
recently:<br>
<br>
&#x2022; The Bike Bunker, which provides secure, convenient, indoor
bicycle parking, opened in February. It&#x2019;s located behind the Otter
Cycle Center. <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/bike-bunker" rel="nofollow">There are still a few spots available for
reservation.</a></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; A real-time bus arrival display has been installed at the
library stop. And a smart phone app for finding bus stops and
schedules is available for download.<br>
<br>
&#x2022; Free and unlimited access to services offered by Monterey-Salinas
Transit over its regular bus routes is more convenient than ever.
Riders need only to swipe their Otter ID cards and take a
seat.<br>
