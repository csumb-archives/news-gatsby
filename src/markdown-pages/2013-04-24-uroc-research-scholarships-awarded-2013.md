<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Omar Davila received a top honor at the
10th annual <a href="http://www.yale.edu/graduateschool/diversity/bouchet_conf.html" rel="nofollow">Bouchet Conference on Diversity and Graduate
Education</a> at Yale University in New Haven, Conn.</p>
<p>His presentation, &#x201C;A Lesson to Learn: Characteristics of
California&#x2019;s Low-Performing School Districts,&#x201D; was named Best Oral
Presentation in the Social Sciences.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The research I presented shed light on the California School
Climate Survey, demonstrating the significant role of learning
environments on academic outcomes,&#x201D; said Davila, who noted that he
beat Ph.D. candidates and well as recent recipients of doctorates
for the honor.<br>

<h3>Awards will help with graduate school application
activities</h3>
<p>Christina Hill and Omar Davila Jr. have been awarded the 2013
Barbara Baldock and Phillip Butler UROC Research Scholarships.</p>
<p>Hill, an Environmental Science, Technology and Policy major, and
Davila, a psychology major, were selected based on their academic
achievements, undergraduate research accomplishments, financial
need, graduate school aspirations and a commitment to serve the
broader community through research and outreach.</p>
<p>Each student will receive $4,000 to support his or her
undergraduate research and graduate school application
activities.</p>
<p>Ms. Baldock and Dr. Butler are committed supporters of the
success of talented students in CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Center (UROC).&#xA0;The Monterey couple
first donated money to sponsor a student researcher in the
2010-2011 academic year and have continued to do so.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We see it as helping give a little bit of a push to a student
on their way to a higher-level degree,&#x201D; Dr. Butler told the
university&#x2019;s magazine in 2012.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We feel like these people are going to be leaders, and they&#x2019;re
going to make a difference,&#x201D; Ms. Baldock said of the UROC students.
&#x201C;That really resonates with both of us.&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>Hill, a native of the Monterey Bay region, is a McNair Scholar.
She is passionate about local and global freshwater
contamination.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to participate in innovative research on the
interconnectivity of earth systems that leads to the solving of
modern environmental challenges,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Currently, she is examining the interactions between surface and
ground water and the linkages between agricultural runoff and water
quality.<br>
<br>
She identified a research mentor at UC Santa Cruz and independently
brokered her summer research placement. She will apply for graduate
fellowships and Ph.D. programs in Groundwater Hydrology in fall
2013.<br>
<br>
Davila&#x2019;s research centers on minority students and academic
retention. He is completing a study of how background factors play
a role in educational aspirations and self-efficacy that he will
present at three national conferences.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>He also just completed a project using GIS to investigate how
social and spatial factors play a role on SAT performance in
California high schools. He will present this research at the
upcoming National Council on Undergraduate Research conference.</p>
<p>Davila, a resident of San Leandro, has a clear vision for the
ultimate goal of his research: &#x201C;a nation where race and ethnicity
no longer determine academic success.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He will apply to graduate fellowships and Ph.D. programs in
sociology in fall 2013, and plans to be a university professor.</br></br></p>
