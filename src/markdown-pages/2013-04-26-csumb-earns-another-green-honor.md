<h3>Named environmentally responsible by Princeton Guide</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s the latest thing in American college ratings: How green is
your campus?</p>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, the answer is: Green enough to earn a
listing in the Princeton Review&#x2019;s Guide to 322 Green College for
the third consecutive year.<br>
&#x2028;<br>
Created by the Princeton Review in partnership with the U.S. Green
Building Council, the guide profiles colleges and universities that
demonstrate a notable commitment to sustainability in their
academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career
preparation.<br>
<br>
<img alt="The solar installation provides 16 percent of CSUMB&apos;s energy" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/solar_sm_1_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:156px">Officials with the
publication say schools were chosen based on a survey of hundreds
of colleges in 2012. The survey asked administrators more than 50
questions about their institution&#x2019;s sustainability-related
policies, practices and programs. From that information, &#x201C;green
ratings&#x201D; for 806 schools were developed. The 322 schools in the
guide earned scores of 83 or higher.<br>
<br>
The publication noted that CSUMB was an early signatory of the
American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, and
is working toward its pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2030 through
energy-saving initiatives including the revolving Energy
Innovations Fund that supports energy-saving projects on campus and
repays itself through energy savings, and the 3-acre solar
installation that is meeting 16 percent of the university&#x2019;s
electricity needs.<br>
<br>
Also drawing praise was the university&#x2019;s food service operations,
which include organic foods, compostable packaging and serving
products, recycling of cooking oil and joining the &#x201C;Meatless
Monday&#x201D; movement. All buildings on campus have designated recycling
areas, and the ubiquity of the blue recycle bins has helped the
university achieve a 50 percent waste diversion rate.<br>
<br>
Even more impressive, according to the guide, is that 90 percent of
campus buildings have undergone energy-related retrofits in the
last few years.<br>
<br>
The green learning opportunities, which allow students to take
courses in subjects as diverse as environmental writing and food
ethics, were also cited.<br>
<br>
Even the campus police department has made strides, trading in a
gas-guzzling vehicle for its first plug-in hybrid.<br>
<br>
The guide pointed out that CSUMB&apos;s commitment to green continues
all the way to graduation &#x2013; when students cross the stage to
receive their degrees in gowns sewn with material made from
recycled plastic bottles.<br>
