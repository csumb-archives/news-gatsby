<h3>David Orr gives public talk May 14</h3>
<p>Oberlin, Ohio, is miles away from what would be considered
national centers of political or economic power. But that&#x2019;s where
David Orr is working to fundamentally change the way we live.</p>
<p><img alt="David Orr" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/david_orr_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:386px">Dr. Orr, professor
of environmental studies and politics and adviser to the president
of Oberlin College, is a visionary in dealing with climate
change.</img></p>
<p>He has written several hundred articles and seven books on
environmentalism, sustainability, green engineering and building,
education and climate change.</p>
<p>On May 14, the local community will have an opportunity to hear
Dr. Orr when he makes a public presentation at the Monterey
Conference Center, sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay. The 90-minute
talk will get under way at 7:30 p.m. in the DeAnza III
ballroom.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Dr. Orr was a driving force behind the Adam Joseph Lewis
Environmental Studies Center at Oberlin, a showpiece for the most
cutting-edge elements of green building. The U.S. Department of
Energy named the facility &#x201C;one of 30 milestone buildings in the
20th century; the New York Times called it the most interesting of
a new generation of college and university buildings.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s also executive director of the Oberlin Project, a joint
effort of the city of Oberlin, the college, and private and
institutional partners to build a prosperous post-fossil-fuel-based
economy.</p>
<p>His most recent book, &#x201C;Down to the Wire: Confronting Climate
Collapse,&#x201D; takes the reader &quot;from the 35,000-foot level to see the
big issue of climate change &#x2013; down to Main Street, where it can be
understood,&#x201D; he told the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper.</p>
<p>He went on to tell the paper, &#x201C;So when you come down from 35,000
feet &#x2013; when you get down from all the big ideas, the science and
down from the abstract to the real &#x2013; where we live, how we live,
food, energy, water, livelihood and support &#x2013; what&apos;s it going to
look like in a post-carbon fuel world?<br>
&#x201C;Is it going to be Hell on Earth or is it going to be a world of
front porches and solar collectors and bicycle trails.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We have it within our power to make that better world &#x2013; the one
with the solar collectors and the bicycles &#x2013; but we won&apos;t have it
much longer. That&apos;s why I called the book &apos;Down to the Wire.&apos;
That&apos;s where we are right now.&#x201D;</br></br></br></p>
<p>Said Dr. Dan Fernandez, co-chair of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
Sustainability Committee, &#x201C;The purpose of Dr. Orr&#x2019;s visit is to
share his great successes as an environmental thinker and
innovator. Can we learn from Oberlin&#x2019;s experiences, become a more
sustainable community and possibly even become climate
positive?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The talk is free and open to the public. Reservations are
requested and can be made <a href="http://CSUMB.EDU/forum" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</p>
