<h3>Former baseball player is graphic designer for Super-Bowl bound
team</h3>
<p>Cal State Monterey Bay alum Ben Mayberry arrived in New Orleans
almost a week before his San Francisco 49er colleagues Colin
Kaepernick, Michael Crabtree and Patrick Willis. As a graphic
designer and member of the 49ers marketing team, Mayberry is the
artist behind the <a href="http://instagram.com/49dzn" rel="nofollow">Quest for Six graphics</a> that have been building
excitement for a Niners Super Bowl run.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s crazy being here for the Super Bowl,&#x201D; says Mayberry. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
unbelievable. And it&#x2019;s Mardi Gras.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Niners&#x2019; marketing team began preparing for a Super Bowl bid
back when the team was still at the NFC Championship stage in order
to have everything ready to go as soon as the team won. The sole
graphic designer for the franchise, Mayberry has contributed to
everything from the team-<img alt="Mayberry designed the 49ers Super Bowl logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/quest_for_six.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:300px">building posters on
the walls of the players&#x2019; hotel rooms to the design of the rally
towels. He&#x2019;s responsible for presenting a consistent team image,
but admits that when the team wins, &#x201C;it just takes over.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;My goal is to be more creative than just a &#x2018;designer&#x2019; &#x201D; says
Mayberry. With the 49ers, he&#x2019;s had the opportunity to contribute
ideas to the team&#x2019;s overall campaign in numerous ways. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re a
small group. We have one person for every job, and then all our
jobs overlap, too. We work well as a marketing team and continue to
gel as the pressure builds.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For instance, he&#x2019;s worked alongside the team&#x2019;s videographers,
providing graphics and developing his art directing skills by
suggesting different ways to set up shots and encouraging them to
implement new technologies such as Go Pro cameras.</p>
<p>Mayberry joined the 49ers two years ago, but it wasn&#x2019;t his first
foray into sports marketing. After graduating from CSUMB with a
self-designed major focused on communication design in 2008, he
spent over 2 years working for the university&#x2019;s athletic
department, developing the Otters&#x2019; distinctive graphic style and
the Otterritory campaigns.</p>
<p>Mayberry describes his experiences with the Otters and the 49ers
as similar. In both organizations, he&#x2019;s had the freedom to
experiment with marketing campaigns across new technologies and
social media channels. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve had the opportunity to work on
anything and everything, which is one of the reasons I&#x2019;ve been
successful,&#x201D; says Mayberry. &#x201C;Knowing the technologies and how
everything works together is inspirational.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This knowledge and inspiration has also fed into a side business
Mayberry runs with his brother, <a href="http://www.diehard.co/" rel="nofollow">Die Hard apparel,</a> which they started while he
was still working at CSUMB. The company produces and sells clothing
for Bay Area sports fans, and the fact that the teams are winning
has been a boon for the company&#x2019;s sales. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a great time for Bay
Area sports,&#x201D; Mayberry says. &#x201C;The Giants won the World Series, the
Forty-Niners are in the Super Bowl, and even the Sharks are
starting the season 5-0.&#x201D;<br>
