<p>Anya Spear, associate director of campus planning at CSU
Monterey Bay, has often been surprised by what she sees discarded
during the annual rush to clean out residence hall rooms and move
off campus for the summer.</p>
<p><img alt="Event manager Max Lorenz helps at 2012 move-out" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/move-out_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:258px">&#x201C;One year, a staff
member found a brand new vacuum cleaner in the trash,&#x201D; Spear said.
&#x201C;In the past, so many reusable items have been thrown away that
people from off campus came to rummage through our dumpsters.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>But more than appliances get tossed aside. Clothing, furniture,
lamps and microwave ovens are haphazardly thrown in dumpsters when
they could be donated to organizations that serve the
community.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Spear has partnered with GreenWaste, the
university&#x2019;s waste hauler, and Hope Services, which collects
electronic waste and reusable items to support its programs and
services for people with developmental disabilities, for CSUMB&#x2019;s
fourth annual zero waste move-out program, taking place May 9-18 on
main campus.</p>
<p>Students in the Main Quad residence halls can purge their
unwanted belongings May 9-12; North Quad residents can do the same
May 16-18. A smaller event is scheduled for May 24 and 31 in East
Campus housing areas.</p>

than 80 percent of what was disposed of during move-out week was
recycled or reused &#x2013; 5.8 tons of recyclable materials and 1.3 tons
of reusable materials were recovered.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s aim for zero waste this year,&#x201D; says the pitch for
volunteers to monitor stations for recycling, donation and waste
and perform a variety of other tasks. To volunteer, <a href="http://housing.csumb.edu/VolunteerMoveOut" rel="nofollow">sign up

<p>The California Department of Resource Recycling and Recovery
(CalRecycle) requires CSUMB and local jurisdictions to report and
reduce waste going to landfills every year. To meet that
requirement, CSUMB began composting food waste from campus dining
facilities, added new yard waste collection bins in East Campus
homes and improved recycling facilities last year. Despite these
efforts, 1,352 tons of waste was sent to landfills; 455 tons of
material was recycled.</p>
