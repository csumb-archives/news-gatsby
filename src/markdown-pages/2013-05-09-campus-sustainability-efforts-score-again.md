<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s alternative transportation program has earned
another recognition: a Best Practices Award from the California
Higher Education Sustainability Conference.</p>
<p>The program was honored in the category of Sustainability
Innovations.</p>
<p>Transportation on campus has become more environmentally
friendly since Megan Tolbert was hired in 2010 as the university&#x2019;s
first transportation planner.</p>
<p><img alt="TRIPwise logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/tripwise_logo_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:136px">Along with
students, staff and faculty members, she worked to create TRIPwise
&#x2013; transportation resource information portal &#x2013; a recognizable
identity for programs, infrastructure and events that support
alternative transportation.</img></p>
<p>The goal is to make it easier for people to get around in ways
other than driving alone in a car. Among TRIPwise resources are a
website, information center located in Mountain Hall, bike map and
rideshare board.</p>
<p>Under the TRIPwise brand, a number of initiatives have been
launched to help the university reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
<p><img alt="Bike Bunker logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/bike_bunker.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:232px">&#x2022; The Bike Bunker,
a commuter bike parking facility, was a TRIPwise project. Funded by
grants, it opened in the spring of 2013, and provides secure,
convenient, indoor bicycle parking. Grant money was also used to
increase bicycle parking by about 30 percent with the purchase of
new bike racks.</img></p>
<p>&#x2022; Enhanced public transit services are one of the biggest
aspects of TRIPwise. The number and frequency of bus lines serving
campus has increased; everyone with an Otter ID card has free,
unlimited access to Monterey Salinas Transit, the local bus system.
As a result, transit ridership is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>For a cost of about $50 per year per student, CSUMB students get
unlimited rides on MST, the campus shuttle, and all transit
services on campus. Before TRIPwise, the same amount of money paid
for a campus shuttle only. This pricing structure is unprecedented
in North America.</p>

for bus and shuttle riders is available for download.</img></p>
<p>&#x2022; The university had the highest rate of participation among
organizations in the regional Rideshare Month competition.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Nearly four miles of bike boulevards have been designated on
campus.</p>
<p>&#x2022; A pair of electric vehicle charging stations have been
installed on campus, funded largely by a grant from the Monterey
Bay Regional Electric Vehicle Association.</p>
<p>Winners in all 11 categories &#x2013; typically one California State
University and one UC campus in each &#x2013; will pick up the awards at
the conference June 23-27 at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>The annual conference started in 2002, when 100 guests were
invited to UC Santa Barbara to talk about best practices. Eleven
years later, the conference draws about 1,000 attendees, with
representatives from college and university campuses throughout the
state coming together to share ideas.</p>
<p>In 2011, CSUMB learned two awards at the conference, for an
energy retrofit of the library that resulted in an energy savings
of approximately 20 percent, and for it work on the Chinatown
Renewal Project in Salinas.</p>
