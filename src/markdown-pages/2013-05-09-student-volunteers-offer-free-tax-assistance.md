<h3>Help available on campus and in the community</h3>
<p>Looking for a way to reduce the stress of tax season? CSU
Monterey Bay student participants in the Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance &#x2013; VITA &#x2013; program may have an answer.<br>
<br>
On March 2, student volunteers from the School of Business will
provide free assistance with state and federal income tax
preparation. The service will be provided in Valley Hall, Suite D,
Room 115, on the university campus. <a href="http://csumb.edu/map" rel="nofollow">Driving directions and a campus map</a>.<br>
<br>
The VITA program is sponsored by United Way Monterey County. The
service is available at nine county locations in addition to
CSUMB.<br>
<br>
Student volunteers are working at most of those sites. All
volunteers have completed a training course and have been certified
by the IRS.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Taxes will be filed electronically, expediting the refund" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/income_tax_1_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:300px">Families and
individuals who earned less than $57,000 in 2012 are eligible.
Filers must bring photo identification, Social Security card or
ITIN card for workers and all family members, their W-2 and 1099
forms and a copy of last year&#x2019;s return. It&apos;s not necessary to make
an appointment.<br>
<br>
Tax forms will be filed electronically. If a refund is due, it will
be deposited in the taxpayer&apos;s account in approximately 10
days.<br>
<br>
According to Dr. Cathy Ku, professor of accounting at CSUMB, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
a good service learning opportunity for students. The first year &#x2013;
2010 &#x2013; five students participated. In 2011, 20 students volunteered
at eight locations in the county and helped families claim $1
million in refunds.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Last year, the number of volunteers grew to 42, and they provided
services at nine sites.&#x201D;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
According to United Way, last year volunteers completed more than
1680 free tax returns and claimed more than $2.6 million in refunds
for local residents.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Business students made up about 37 percent of all of last year&#x2019;s
volunteers, contributing our expertise to stimulate our local
economy,&#x201D; Dr. Ku said.<br>
<br>
While all students passed the required basic certification course,
last year, &#x201C;10 students and I passed the intermediate level
course,&#x201D; said Dr. Ku. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why we were able to set up a VITA
site at CSUMB.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The United Way emphasizes that the program is free to those who
qualify.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>According to the organization&#x2019;s website, there is no charge for
the tax preparation, no charge for direct deposit to the taxpayer&#x2019;s
bank account and no hidden fees. A list of community locations,
dates and hours, is available on the <a href="http://www.unitedwaymcca.org/free-tax-prep" rel="nofollow">United
Way website</a>.<br>
