this year&#x2019;s recipient of the Monterey County Film Commission&#x2019;s
student scholarship.</img></p>
<p>Fryou, a senior at California State University, Monterey Bay
studying Teledramatic Arts and Technology, is from Aromas. He plans
to use the $2,000 grant to help with expenses for his capstone
project.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This scholarship will help out tremendously, and will allow me
to . . . jumpstart my career in film,&#x201D; Fryou told the film
commission.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ever since I was very young, I have had a passion for
filmmaking, acting and being around the camera. It was a fun hobby
that has now become a career choice for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The annual Monterey County Film Commission Director Emeritus
Richard Tyler Scholarship Award is named in memory of Tyler, who
served for 20 years on the film comission&#x2019;s board of directors. It
was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of
film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are
enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was
established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation
for Monterey County.</p>
<p class="small">The scholarship was created in 2008 and has gone
to CSUMB students each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo
shared the inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez &#x2013; who now works
in the TAT Department as a media specialist &#x2013; was the winner.
Rachel Asendorf received the award in 2010; Dominic Parisi won it
in 2011; and Joey Blackburn was last year&#x2019;s winner.<br>
