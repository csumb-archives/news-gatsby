are Emmy awards for sports broadcasting?&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>Several dozen of them were handed out in New York on May 7 at
the annual Sports Emmy Awards event.</p>
<p>One of them went to Casey Richards (TAT &#x2019;02). Richards, a
resident of Atlanta, received an Emmy from the National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences in the category of outstanding playoff
coverage.</p>
<p>He was part of a team at TNT that won for its work on the
National Basketball Association post-season telecasts in 2012.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was a writer/producer on the team. We all worked on this &#x2013;
the award was for the comprehensive playoff package. That means
promotional spots, lead-ins, game elements . . . creative services
that required a quick turnaround,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>For this year&#x2019;s basketball playoffs, currently under way, he&#x2019;s
doing the games&#x2019; opening pieces &#x2013; &#x201C;a kind of music video to hype
people up for the game,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s also working on promos for the Sunday baseball broadcasts
on TBS and creating pieces for the upcoming NASCAR season.</p>
<p>While he&#x2019;s won other awards, and was nominated for an Emmy last
year for his work on a baseball video featuring Bruce Springsteen,
this is his first Emmy win.</p>
<p>Richards&#x2019; career has taken him across the country several times.
After graduating in 2002, he worked for an advertising agency in
Los Angeles, part of the in-house video editorial team. That was
followed by a move to Atlanta, where he worked as an associate
writer/producer for on-air promotions at Turner Broadcasting.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, he moved to Fox Sports, but stayed in
Atlanta. In 2008, an opportunity presented itself at E!
Entertainment in Los Angeles, where he worked as a writer/producer
of on-air promotions. Then another cross-country move &#x2013; back to
Turner where he works in the Creative Services Sports Unit, the
network&#x2019;s in-house advertising operation for all the company&#x2019;s
sports properties, including professional basketball, baseball,
NASCAR, golf and college basketball.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t target sports out of school,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I fell into it
out of necessity when the network I was working for was taken over
by Fox Sports. It&#x2019;s the same way I got into reality television when
accepting a job at E! Regardless of the content, I&#x2019;ve always
adapted and all my jobs have been on the creative side of the
industry.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But sports is not unfamiliar territory for him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a fan. You have to be to do this kind of work. I get free
tickets to games &#x2013; a nice perk. But I don&#x2019;t watch ESPN 24 hours a
day, and I can&#x2019;t rattle off statistics.&#x201D;</p>
