<p>The Marina Skate Park is now adorned with a bright new mural,
courtesy of Matt Floriani and his capstone project.</p>
<p>Marina Youth Arts, a non-profit organization that offers
after-school arts programs for children, provided funding for
materials. Floriani worked with students from the Marina Teen
Center and the nearby Los Arboles Middle School.</p>
<p>He is one of 31 capstone students in this year&#x2019;s graduating
class of Visual and Public Art majors.&#xA0;</p>
