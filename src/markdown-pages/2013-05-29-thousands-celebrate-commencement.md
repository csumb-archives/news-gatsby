<h3>President Ochoa presides over first ceremony</h3>
<p>Enduring one final test &#x2013; a two-hour-plus ceremony on a warm and
breezy day &#x2013; about 1,300 CSU Monterey Bay students celebrated their
graduation May 18 in Freeman Stadium on the Seaside campus.</p>
<p><img alt="Keynote speaker Robert Danziger" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/danziger_for_web.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:312px">It was the largest
graduating class in school history. They received their diplomas
before a capacity crowd of about 8,000 family members and
friends.</img></p>
<p>Keynote speaker Robert Danziger, a sustainable energy pioneer,
musician and inventor, told the students that they can compete with
people from Yale and Harvard and MIT, &#x201C;just as I had to.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you have the honor, the integrity and the fire in the belly,
you can make it. You can be as insightful and successful as anyone
from any of those schools.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Danziger worked at the California Institute of Technology&#x2019;s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he had a close-up look at one of
the space age&#x2019;s most ambitious projects, the Voyager exploration
into deep space.</p>
<p>While still in his 20s, he founded Sunlaw Energy Corp. His goal
was to research, develop, demonstrate and commercialize new energy
and environmental technology. He has been a lecturer at Stanford
University and an adjunct professor of alternative energy law at
Whittier College School of Law.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You have accomplished much and earned the right to stand
proud,&#x201D; he told the graduates. . . . &#x201C;When your name is called and
you walk across this stage and receive your diploma, your
ancestors&#x2019; dreams have come true, their hearts are glad, and they
can now rest content. Finally, every sacrifice they made, every
oppression they endured, was worth it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He reminded the graduates that while there may have been
setbacks along the way, they prevailed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I, and indeed many of you, were told we were not going to make
it. Almost everyone here today has been hit, rallied, and redeemed
themselves, and at this time I am delighted to note that we were
right and those who doubted us were wrong.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="President Eduardo Ochoa" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ochoa_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:381px">The commencement
ceremony, the 17th in the university&#x2019;s history, was the first
presided over by<a href="http://president.csumb.edu/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Eduardo Ochoa,</a> who took over as the university&#x2019;s
president last July.</img></p>
<p>The ceremony opened with the traditional welcome in Spanish,
Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese, delivered by members of the
faculty. That was followed by the national anthem, sung by <a href="../../feb/4/csumb-student-american-idol.html" rel="nofollow">Stevie Rae Stephens</a>, a music major and member of the
Class of 2013.</p>
<p>In his remarks, President Ochoa cited the &#x201C;amazing array of
talent&#x201D; among the graduates, and singled out several students whose
stories are representative of the Class of 2013.</p>
<p>Among them were biology major Michael Diaz, who is headed to a
Ph.D. program at the University of California, Irvine; Katie Canul,
the first CSUMB grad to be accepted to UC San Francisco Medical
School; Petra Mansfield, one of the first graduates of the master
of social work program; Heather Cusson, a former Army medic who is
headed to nursing school; and Julio Castro, a first-generation
college student who plans to attend graduate school with an eye
toward government or diplomatic service.</p>
<p>President Ochoa pointed out that among the graduating class are
12 veterans. &#x201C;Being located at the former site of Fort Ord, our
campus is proud of our ties to our nation&#x2019;s military heritage. We
are dedicated to meeting the educational needs of those who have
served our country so well,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>He introduced student speaker Ana Angeles, winner of the
President&#x2019;s Award for Exemplary Student Achievement.</p>
<p>Angeles, a Business Administration major, served as the student
government&#x2019;s chief financial officer and co-chaired the Student Fee
Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>She passed along a piece of advice she had received.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some of us have received employment offers, some of us are
seeking advanced degrees, and a lot of us are still figuring it
out. As people keep asking us about our plans for the future, I
want to share some great advice I&#x2019;ve received: we will end up
exactly where we need to be.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So, don&#x2019;t worry. The puzzle is coming together even though you
can&#x2019;t yet see the picture.&#x201D;</p>
