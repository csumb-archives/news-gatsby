Ochoa</a> welcomed the campus community back for the fall semester,
delivered his <a href="http://president.csumb.edu/2012-president%E2%80%99s-welcome-address" rel="nofollow">State of the University address</a>, and then
introduced the President&#x2019;s Medal recipients.<br>
<br>
Last spring, the university community was invited to make
nominations. The nominees represented a cross-section of campus &#x2013;
some have a long history at the university, others joined more
recently; some have direct contact with students, others have an
operational focus.<br>
<br>
MacDonald, senior editor in University Communications, was the
staff recipient of the President&#x2019;s Medal. Her colleagues focused on
her leadership, her in-depth knowledge of the university, and her
ability to explain complex concepts in simple, straightforward
language.<br>
<br>
One of the people who nominated her called MacDonald a &#x201C;true
Internet marketing and communication specialist. The university has
never seen the type of leadership and experience she brings to
extending the brand of our institution using social media and the
web.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
MacDonald developed the new on-line course catalog, administers the
university&#x2019;s Facebook and Twitter presence, works with departments
across campus to enhance their web presence, and edits the
university&#x2019;s magazine. She has been instrumental in sharing the
university news with the widest possible audience.<br>
<br>
Dr. Fernandez was awarded the faculty medal. He embodies the
threefold faculty mission of teaching, research and service.<br>
<br>
According to the nominating committee, he has taken on leadership
roles that can be &#x201C;lightning rods for a growing campus, and he has
responded with grace in effectively facilitating the important
changes at issue.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
He&#x2019;s done this while continuing his work as an outstanding and
valued teacher in science and environmental policy and has taken a
leading role in advocating for campus sustainability.<br>
<br>
Saunders, vice president for administration and finance, earned the
President&#x2019;s Medal for administrators. His colleagues expressed
their appreciation of his efforts to create an atmosphere of mutual
respect. &#x201C;He projects to everyone working under his management that
every person is doing as important a job as he is doing.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Ochoa added that, &#x201C;His leadership of the University Corporation
and in the area of administration and finance has been vital in
keeping the university as a whole on a sound financial footing in
these difficult economic times.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As part of the program, employee service awards were presented to
76 people who have been with the university for five years; 10-year
pins were awarded to 41 staff members; and 34 others were
acknowledged for 15 years of service.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
