the action taken by the Board of Trustees in making permanent my
appointment as president of Cal State Monterey Bay, Dr. Ochoa said.
&#x201C;Since arriving in July, I have been most impressed with the people
I have met on campus and in the community. I believe this
university is poised for great things, and I look forward to
continuing to serve as its president.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Ochoa returned to the CSU after serving from 2010 to 2012 in
the Obama Administration as the U.S. assistant secretary for
postsecondary education &#x2013; advising the secretary on higher
education issues, administering more than 60 programs and
overseeing financial aid policy and accreditation.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;President Ochoa brought to Monterey Bay his unique blend of
national expertise and a homegrown connection to the university
mission,&#x201D; said CSU Board of Trustees chair Bob Linscheid. &#x201C;He has
connected with students and faculty to move the campus forward on
its core values of diversity, sustainability and community
service.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Ochoa grew up in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before moving to
Portland, Ore., with his family while in high school. He has earned
degrees in physics, nuclear science and economics from Reed
College, Columbia University and the New School for Social
Research, respectively. His plans to return to work in his native
Argentina were sidetracked by a military coup.<br>
<br>
He refocused his energy in California, teaching at Fresno State as
well as at California State University, Los Angeles, where he was a
full professor and chair of the economics and statistics
department. He also led the university&#x2019;s Bureau of Business and
Economic Research, and served as acting dean of its School of
Business and Economics.<br>
<br>
In 1997, Dr. Ochoa was hired as the dean of Cal Poly Pomona&apos;s
College of Business Administration, where he served for six years.
This was followed by seven years as the provost and vice president
for academic affairs at Sonoma State University.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
