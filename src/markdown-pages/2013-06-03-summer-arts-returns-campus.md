<p>After an exciting debut in 2012, CSU Summer Arts returns to
campus in July with a lineup of 17 classes and 52 public
events.</p>
<p>Students &#x2013; who come from CSU campuses, other four-year and
two-year colleges as well as the local community &#x2013; are immersed in
rigorous training 12 hours a day during the two-week sessions.
Classes will be offered in dance, music, theater, creative writing,
visual arts, filmmaking and animation.</p>
<p>The guest artists/teachers include actors from the Steppenwolf
Theatre Company; Eliot Fisk, who will be among the classical guitar
instructors; and professionals from DreamWorks, who will lead the
animation session.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are here to ignite artful minds. The community is invited to
come and enjoy 28 days of eclectic art-making,&#x201D; added Rachel Nardo,
director of CSU Summer Arts. &#x201C;The most exciting part of Summer Arts
is that there will be so many exceptional arts events taking place
in our own backyard,&#x201D; said Rob Klevan, the program&#x2019;s community
relations specialist.<br>
<br>
The public events include lectures, concerts and theatrical
productions, all priced to make them ac- cessible to a wide
audience. In addition, each course offers a free public performance
or &#x201C;culmination&#x201D; at the end of the session where students showcase
their talents.</br></br></p>

<em><strong>Here&#x2019;s a preview of the kinds of events that will be
open to the public during July</strong>:</em></br></br></p>
<p>On July 2, DreamWorks animator Rex Grignon will talk about the
process of animation, and how cool it is to work on films such as
the Shrek series, the Madagascar series, Kung Fu Panda, Megamind,
and the soon-to-be-released Turbo. The 7 p.m. talk will be held in
the Tanimura and Antle library on campus. Tickets are $8 for
general admission; $5 for students and seniors.</p>
