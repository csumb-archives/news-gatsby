<h4><strong>Kathryn England-Aytes will teach in Cherokee Studies
Program as visiting scholar</strong></h4>
<p>T<em>he war for Indian children will be won in the
classroom.</em><br>
&#x2013; &#xA0;Wilma Mankiller</br></p>
<p>The quotation from the late principal chief of the Cherokee
Nation is displayed <img alt="Kathryn England-Aytes" height="180" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/igx_migrate/images/Kathryn.jpg" style="float:left" width="127">in the cubicle of Kathryn
England-Aytes, a lecturer in the Social, Behavioral and Global
Studies Division at California State University, Monterey
Bay.&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>It serves as a daily reminder that native voices in education
are critical. And it makes her invitation to spend the summer as a
visiting scholar in the Cherokee Studies Program at Northeastern
State University in Tahlequah, Okla., especially meaningful.</p>
<p>NSU dates to 1846, when the Cherokee National Council authorized
establishment of male and female seminaries to fulfill the
requirement of a treaty between the United States and the Cherokee
Nation that public and higher education be provided for the
Cherokees.</p>
<p>It is the second oldest institution of higher education west of
the Mississippi, and still has a proud heritage of serving native
people, currently claiming the largest number of full-time
undergraduates who are American Indians.</p>
<p>As the granddaughter of a Cherokee educator who began her
teaching career in 1908, England-Aytes (pictured above) continues
to be influenced by stories of her grandmother&apos;s teaching.</p>
<p>&quot;My grandmother&apos;s influence has reached into the 21st century in
my multimedia classrooms with technology she could never have
imagined, but within a learning environment she would easily
recognize, and hopefully enjoy,&quot; England-Aytes said.</p>
<p>England-Aytes attended public schools in Oklahoma in the 1960s,
pursuing higher education as a returning student in the 1980s while
raising two daughters. She completed undergraduate and graduate
degrees in psychology and social science at Southern Oregon
University, graduating summa cum laude, while working as a family
advocate within the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Since 1998, she has taught courses in social and behavioral
sciences in Oregon and California, but her heart is often in
Oklahoma, and she is delighted to return there to teach a course
entitled &quot;Historical Perspectives of Native American Women,&quot; which
will include presentations by Cherokee Nation historians, educators
and tribal members.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The course comes at a particularly poignant time, just weeks
after the death of Mankiller, who last October had been named NSU&apos;s
first Sequoyah Institute Fellow.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot imagine Tahlequah without Chief Mankiller,&quot;
England-Aytes said. &quot;Her early passing was such a loss for the
Cherokee Nation and beyond. We are using one of her books as a
text, and it is certainly a privilege to be able to honor her
extraordinary work and life, not only for native women and the
Cherokee Nation, but for women across the world.&quot;</p>
