<p>Kate Lockwood, assistant professor of computer science and
information technology, has been honored with the Allen Griffin
Award for excellence in teaching at the post-secondary level. The
award is sponsored by the Community Foundation for Monterey
County.</p>

<p>Established in 1982, the Griffin Award was created by a bequest
from the late Col. Allen Griffin, former publisher of the Monterey
Herald and founder and former board president of the Community
Foundation. The award honors teachers who have a record of
sustained excellence in the classroom and who have made a
significant impact in the community.</p>
<p>Dr. Lockwood joined CSUMB in 2009, and has taught a variety of
courses in programming, digital games and other computer-related
classes. She has developed innovative teaching methods for her
classes, and has presented these methods in workshops for her
campus colleagues, at CSU-wide seminars and at international
conferences on computer science education.</p>
<p>Among her teaching innovations is use of the &#x201C;inverted
classroom.&#x201D; The concept swaps what has traditionally been done at
home and what has been done in class. Students watch videos of
lectures and interactive exercises at home, and then use valuable
in-class time for discussion, hands-on experiences and small-group
activities.</p>
<p>This summer, she has been invited to a university in Sweden to
teach faculty members in several departments how to integrate the
inverted classroom into their teaching.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, mentoring and advising students, she
chairs the Faculty Senate&#x2019;s Technology Committee, sits on a variety
of campus committees and working groups, and leads teaching and
learning workshops for other CSUMB faculty members. And she
maintains an active research program in artificial intelligence,
focusing on programming systems that can engage in spatial
reasoning.</p>
<p>In the community, she has worked with local high school students
competing in a national robotics competition and helps with
programming workshops where students learn basic skills before the
competition season begins. During the summer, she has been involved
with running computer science workshops for at-risk high school
students.</p>
<p>She holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Northwestern
University, an M.S. in information and a bachelor&#x2019;s in computer
engineering from the University of Michigan. Her research interests
include artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Griffin Award winners from CSUMB include Aparna Sreenivasan,
Kent Adams, Pat Tinsley McGill and Scott Waltz. The award was given
annually until 2011, when the Community Foundation changed to an
every-other-year schedule.</p>
