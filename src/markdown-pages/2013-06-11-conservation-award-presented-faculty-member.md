faculty member Suzanne Worcester has received a Garden Club of
America Club Conservation Commendation for her work with students
and the community.</img></p>
<p>The award is given to a person who has made significant
contributions to conservation in her or his community and is not a
GCA member.&#xA0;The Carmel-by-the-Sea Garden Club nominated her
for the award.</p>
<p>Dr. Worchester is a professor in the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy.</p>
<p>Her research interests include restoration ecology, conservation
biology and environmental science education. Her personal interests
include conservation, sustainability and enjoying nature.</p>
<p>She and her family &#x201C;try to chart the path to a more sustainable
American lifestyle,&#x201D; to make sure her children &#x201C;will be able to
experience the many beautiful places that exist on this planet,&#x201D;
Dr. Worchester said.</p>
<p>She is a member of Keep Fort Ord Wild and the Fort Ord
Recreational Users, and has been active in the movement to focus
development on the blighted lands of Fort Ord rather than in the
remaining wildlands. She worked with others to save the coast live
oak trees and wild space at the Whispering Oaks property and lay
the groundwork for Fort Ord public lands to be designated a
national monument. She is a former board member of LandWatch
Monterey County.</p>
<p>At CSUMB, she involves students in applied conservation projects
such as monitoring dune plant restoration work, evaluating the
response of maritime chaparral to fire, and working with the Bureau
of Land Management to monitor the effects of sheep grazing on
grasslands. She also studies the vernal pools on Fort Ord National
Monument.</p>
<p>The award will be presented in the fall.</p>
