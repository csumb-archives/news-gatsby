<h3>San Francisco public art project unveiled</h3>
<p>Johanna Poethig, whose &#x201C;Celebrate Ability&#x201D; project is about to
be unveiled at the Hamilton Recreation Center, has been making
public art in San Francisco and around the world since the
1980s.</p>
<p><img alt="&apos;Ability&apos; is the theme of the public art project" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ability_2.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:254px">The six mosaic
medallions that make up the project play with words and images of
California native species to highlight shared abilities. The goal
was to come up with designs that would appeal to the broad range of
community members who use the center.</img></p>
<p>Poethig, an associate professor in CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Visual and
Public Art Department, explained that Hamilton Rec Center is
located near San Francisco&#x2019;s Japantown, the Western Addition, and
the Fillmore District. Asian American families and elderly
residents are drawn to the special programs at the center.
Youngsters use the basketball courts, swimming pool and
playground.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an example of how these city rec centers are so essential
for fostering a healthy urban life,&#x201D; Poethig said.&#xA0;&#x201C;My artwork
reflects this by playing with the idea of &#x2018;ability&#x2019; in a way that
can include everyone and also remind us of where we live &#x2013;
California. We need to honor our natural life in our urban areas,&#x201D;
she said.</p>
<p>The texts were chosen in a discussion with the staff. The
&#x201C;Enjoy-ability&#x201D; mosiac highlights the&#xA0;<img alt="Adapt-ability is essential for everyone" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/adapt.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:324px">swimming pool at
Hamilton. The &#x201C;Endure-ability&#x201D; medallion uses the crane, a common
image in Japanese art. It honors the elderly residents of the area,
some of whom endured internment camps during World War II.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Flex-ability&#x201D; represents the idea that everyone needs to
exercise, and be flexible in our intellect, too. &#x201C;Adapt-ability&#x201D; is
essential and &#x201C;Response-ability&#x201D; fosters consciousness about the
environment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the &#x2018;Ability&#x2019; mosaic honors that we all have abilities to
develop and celebrate,&#x201D; Poethig said.</p>
<p>The center is located at 1900 Geary Boulevard, San Francisco.
The opening reception will be held at noon on April 6.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Rec Center is just one of many sites in San
Francisco where she has created public art. Others include the
Civic Center post office, the I-Hotel, several buildings in the
Tenderloin, the Juvenile Justice Center, Rochambeau Park and the
South of Market area.</p>

member at CSUMB, Poethig has worked in collaboration with other
artists, architects, urban planners, design teams, arts
commissions, specific communities and cultural groups during her
career.</img></p>
<p>She was raised in the Philippines through high school and has
lived in Chicago, San Francisco and Oakland since coming to the
United States. She received her BFA at University of California,
Santa Cruz and her MFA at Mills College in Oakland.</p>
<p>Her paintings, sculpture, video and installations explore
surfaces, symbols and artifacts of culture, history, archeology and
futurist narratives, human nature, political satire and the
colonizing metaphors used by consumerist, capitalist
marketing.&#xA0;<br>
