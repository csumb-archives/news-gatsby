a lecturer in the Music and Performing Arts Department, is the
recipient of an ASCAP Plus Award in the concert music division.</img></p>
<p>The award is given by the American Society of Composers, Authors
and Publishers, and is based on the unique value of each composer&#x2019;s
catalog of original compositions as well as recent
performances.</p>
<p>According to the organization, the grants support the growth and
development of the nation&#x2019;s musical future. The announcement was
made in early October; the grant will be distributed in
January.</p>
<p>Dr. Sammons, a composer and guitarist, teaches analogue mixing
and digital editing as well as the MPA capstone class and master
classes.<br>
<br>
His music explores ideas such as audience interactivity,
improvisation, the intersection of popular and classical music, and
the pairing of electronic and acoustic sound. As a performer, he
explores multiple genres on electric guitar, classical guitar and
other instruments.</br></br></p>
<p>He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Columbia University and a
master&#x2019;s and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>His research interests include composition and
audience-interactive music,&#xA0;the relationship between play and
composition, new music for the guitar, and the intersection and
overlap between &quot;popular&quot; music and &quot;art&quot; music.<br>
