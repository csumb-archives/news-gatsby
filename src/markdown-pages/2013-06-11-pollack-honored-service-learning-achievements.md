<p>In recognition of his work to promote service learning and
community-campus partnerships throughout the Monterey Bay and
Salinas Valley, Seth Pollack has been named winner of the 2013
Richard E. Cone Award by California Campus Compact.</p>

years, Dr. Pollack has been director of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Service
Learning Institute. He has helped the university become a national
leader in service learning and civic engagement.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Service learning and partnerships are part of the very fiber of
our being as a campus, and that is due in large part to the
continued leadership on the part of Dr. Pollack,&#x201D; said CSUMB
Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe.</p>
<p>CSUMB is the only two-time recipient of the White House
President&#x2019;s Award for Community Service in Higher Education (2006
and 2011), given each year to the six top programs in the nation by
the Corporation for National and Community Service.</p>
<p>The university has earned recognition for embedding service
learning in the core curriculum as an academic requirement. As a
result, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB students perform service
learning each year, working in partnership with 500 local schools,
government agencies and nonprofit organizations in the region. Last
school year, more than 2,200 CSUMB students provided approximately
68,000 hours of service to 180 organizations.</p>
<p>One example of Dr. Pollack&#x2019;s leadership in community-university
partnerships is CSUMB&#x2019;s involvement in the Salinas Chinatown
Renewal Project. Since 2006, more than 1,200 students and 20
faculty members have participated in this community-based effort to
revitalize the Chinatown neighborhood of Salinas.</p>
<p>Working with the cultural communities of Chinatown and
homeless-serving agencies, CSUMB has offered job training and
computer literacy classes at the Soledad Street Community Learning
Center; created a 30,000 square foot community garden; and
collected more than 100 oral histories of the Chinese, Japanese and
Filipino families who previously resided in the neighborhood, along
with hundreds of historic photos and artifacts. The oral histories
and artifacts will form the basis of the new Chinatown Community
Center and Museum, currently being established in the newly
renovated Republic Caf&#xE9; on Soledad Street.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In addition to being a passionate and skillful community leader
and an expert in his field, he has worked tirelessly to promote
service learning and community engaged scholarship to
administrators, faculty, students and community partners, with
impressive results,&#x201D; said Elaine Ikeda, executive director of
California Campus Compact.</p>
<p>Dr. Pollack holds a Ph.D. in international development education
and a master&#x2019;s in organizational sociology from Stanford
University, and a B.A. in international affairs from the University
of Colorado.</p>

to receive this award, as it honors the exceptional work we are
doing at CSUMB. It is such a benefit to be working at an
institution that has embraced civic engagement as a core component
of the academic program,&#x201D; Dr. Pollack said.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I can see the difference that it makes on our students, as they
begin to discover that they can be a positive impact on people&apos;s
lives. Slowly, that will transform our entire region!&quot;</p>
<p>Richard E. Cone directed the Joint Educational Project at the
University of Southern California for 25 years before his
retirement in 2002. He has been an influential voice in the
national dialogue on civic engagement and service learning since
the 1970s. California Campus Compact presented Dick Cone the first
Richard E. Cone Award for Excellence and Leadership in Cultivating
Community Partnerships in Higher Education in 1999. Since then, the
award has been given annually to a person who has made significant
contributions to the development of partnerships between
institutions of higher learning and communities &#x2013; partnerships
through which student learning and the quality of life in
communities are simultaneously improved.</p>
