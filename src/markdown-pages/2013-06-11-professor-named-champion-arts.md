professor of English who teaches literary and film studies, will be
honored in the professional category for her work as an arts
advocate who was instrumental in bringing the CSU Summer Arts
program to the Monterey Bay area.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hosting CSU Summer Arts here at CSUMB is something I worked toward
for five years. I followed the events of Summer Arts at Fresno and
became determined to bring this premier program to our campus,&quot; Dr.
Curry said.</br></br></img></p>
<p>&quot;I believe in Monterey as a hub for artists and envision CSUMB
as a key participate in the arts. Summer Arts is a perfect match
for our university and our community.&quot;</p>
<p>Other honorees are Tim Jackson, artistic director of the
Monterey Jazz Festival (lifetime achievement award); Dr. Carl
Christiansen (luminary); Henry Miller Memorial Library (nonprofit);
John and Barbara Pekema (philanthropists); and Liz Sanchez and
Hamish Tyler (volunteers).</p>
<p>According to the Arts Council, the event is a &#x201C;tribute to the
great work and inspiring spirit of our champions.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are proud to honor these exemplary leaders who have
demonstrated such tremendous passion and commitment to the arts in
Monterey County,&#x201D; the council said.</p>
<p>Dr. Curry has been teaching and writing about literary and
filmic arts for more than 25 years and is a recognized scholar in
both fields. She is a full professor in the Division of Humanities
and Communication and former dean of the College of Arts,
Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>
<p>For the past three years, she has taught a popular class through
the university&#x2019;s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute called &#x201C;Tackling
the Tough Ones Together.&#x201D; The class &#x2013; which fills up quickly &#x2013; has
covered works by William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia
Woolf, Samuel Beckett and, this semester, James Joyce&#x2019;s
<em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>Her two most recent scholarly articles will be published in late
2012 and in 2013. One article addresses the role of whiteness in
Woody Allen&apos;s films <em>Manhattan</em>, <em>Match Point</em> and
<em>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</em>. The second article explores race
and identity in Darren Aronofsky&apos;s <em>Requiem for a
Dream.</em></p>
<p>She is the fourth faculty member at CSUMB to be honored by the
Arts Council, joining 2007 honoree Jennifer Colby, 2009 honoree
Amalia Mesa-Bains, and last year&#x2019;s honoree Enid Baxter
Blader.<br>
