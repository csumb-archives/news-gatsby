<p>It&#x2019;s been a busy year for CSUMB professor Umi Vaughan.</p>
<p>In April, his book, <a href="../../mar/15/new-book-traces-history-bata%CC%81-drumming.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Carlos Aldama&apos;s Life in Bat&#xE1;: Cuba, Diaspora,
and the Drum</em>,</a> was published.<br>
<br>
In October, the University of Michigan Press published his most
recent work, <a href="http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=3355867" rel="nofollow"><em>Rebel Dance, Renegade Stance: Timba Music and Black
Identity in Cuba.</em></a><br>
<br>
This month, Dr. Vaughan was invited by the Secretary of Culture in
Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, to participate in an event called
the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.pelourinho.ba.gov.br/2012/11/programacao-do-i-encontro-de-culturas-negras.html" rel="nofollow">Encounter of Black Cultures</a>, where he presented
his work on the African Diaspora. He learned as much as he
taught.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&quot;I exchanged ideas with scholars and artists from Brazil,
Uruguay, Venezuela and Trinidad, to name a few countries,&quot; Dr.
Vaughan said. &quot;The Candombe drums from Uruguay were a revelation to
me, another little known, very beautiful aspect of African Diaspora
culture.&quot;</p>
<p>He also observed samba gatherings throughout the city of
Salvador da Bahia and developed ideas to extend his research on
collective action through music and dance.</p>
<p>&quot;My friends handed me a bell and I played music in an Afro
Brazilian drumming ceremony,&quot; he said. &quot;And I met and learned from
the famous Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a great experience,&#x201D; Dr. Vaughan said, &#x201C;and may produce
projects that involve collaboration between CSUMB and other
international educational and cultural institutions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An anthropologist, musician, dancer and photographer, Dr.
Vaughan is associate professor of Africana Studies at CSUMB, where
he created an innovative course called Afro Cuba Hip Hop: Music and
Dance in the Black Atlantic. It covers the social history and
practice of music/dance styles from throughout the African
Diaspora.<br>
<br>
He has conducted extensive anthropological research in Cuba about
Afro Cuban music and dance, and has created numerous scholarly
presentations, art exhibits and cultural events in the U.S. and
abroad.<br>
<br>
He holds a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from the University of
Michigan.<br>
