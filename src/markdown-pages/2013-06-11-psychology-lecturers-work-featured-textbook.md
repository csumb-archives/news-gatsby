England-Aytes, a lecturer in psychology at CSUMB, has contributed
to a book that&#x2019;s the first of its kind for educational
publishing.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream
Education,&#x201D; published by Peter Lang Publishers, was written by
American Indian rights activist Four Arrows. It provides guidance
on incorporating indigenous perspectives into classrooms from
kindergarten through college.</p>
<p>Guest authors, including Professor England-Aytes, contributed
six of the book&#x2019;s 13 chapters. Her chapter deals with American
Indian historical trauma and education.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Four Arrows is a respected educator,&#x201D; Professor England-Aytes
said. &#x201C;I was honored he asked me to participate.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The book has been praised by Noam Chomsky, William Ayers and
Henry Giroux, among others.</p>
<p>Chomsky, MIT professor emeritus, said of it:</p>
<p>&quot;This enlightening book reminds us that the grim prognosis for
life on this planet is the consequence of a few centuries of
forgetting what traditional societies knew, and the surviving ones
still recognize. We must nurture and preserve our common
possession, the traditional commons, for future generations, and
this must be one of our highest values, or we are all doomed. To
regain this sensibility from those who have preserved it we must
pay careful attention to their understanding and practices,
especially their educational practices as brought to us in these
thoughtful chapters.&quot;</p>
