<h3>Filmmaker takes story of California water to New York
audience</h3>
<p>Most Californians are familiar with how struggles over water
have shaped the modern American West.</p>

will help to educate New Yorkers about that history on Sept. 28,
when her video, &#x201C;The West,&#x201D; will be projected onto the Manhattan
Bridge anchorage and archway.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The West&#x201D; is an animation that presents a history of water
engineering in California, a history that has determined the
colonization and contemporary conditions of the western United
States.<br>
<br>
The version that will be shown in New York is drawn from a longer
film that features a score by If Thousands, and is part of the
Water, CA video and <a href="http://waterca.net" rel="nofollow">book project</a>&#xA0;co-edited with Nicole
Antebi.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I&apos;ve never made such a labor-intensive series,&#x201D; said Blader, chair
of CSUMB&#x2019;s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department and
associate professor of experimental film.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Blader&#x2019;s work will be shown as part of Codex Dynamic, a
large-scale video projection exhibition that&#x2019;s part of the annual
Dumbo Arts Festival in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Featuring video artworks by internationally renowned video
artists, the Codex exhibition is epic-size eye candy that
transforms space, time and our perceived reality,&#x201D; said the
Huffington Post.</p>

have been shown at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C; the Museum
of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; Location One in New York;
Sundance; and in Vienna, London, Glasgow and Mallorca, among other
places.<br>
<br>
In March 2008, she was included in the Getty Museum&#x2019;s retrospective
California Video, 1960-present. Her 2009 animation, Olive&#x2019;s
Backyard Concert, screens on PBS stations in California. A
collection of her works, A Film is A Burning Place, was released by
Microcinema International in 2009. In 2011, she co-wrote an
interpretive guide to the Crocker Art Museum&#x2019;s collection of
American painting based on the themes of water and the
environment.<br>
<br>
Her work has been written about in the New York Times, Artforum,
Artreviews, DVD Talk and many other books, journals and
magazines.<br>
<br>
She earned a bachelor of fine arts from The Cooper Union (1996),
was a fellow at Yale University and received her MFA with a
fellowship from Claremont Graduate University (2000).</br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>The Brooklyn event kicks off a very busy month for Blader that
includes shows and appearances related to the water project.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happening:</p>
<p>&#x2022; On Oct. 5, she will give tours of The Huntington&apos;s European
and American historical collections through an environmental and
post-colonial lens. &#x201C;I&apos;ll talk about what the paintings mean
contextualized within the history of Anglo Americans&#x2019; relationships
with the American West, its people and its landscapes,&#x201D; Blader
said.</p>
<p>&#x2022; On Oct. 6, the Water, CA project will be featured in an
<a href="http://www.armoryarts.org/exhibitions/exhibitions-2012/facing-the-sublime-in-water-ca/" rel="nofollow">exhibition</a> at the Armory Center for Arts in
Pasadena. &#x201C;The West&#x201D; will be projected and screened continuously in
the museum&apos;s galleries.</p>
<p>Also on display will be the Water, CA website and two paintings
created for the museum. One shows California without water
engineering (prior to dams) and the second is California with
contemporary water projects in place. (One of the paintings is
displayed above.)<br>
<br>
&#x2022; On Oct. 16, Blader will give part of a plenary address to several
thousand scientists at the biennial <a href="http://scienceconf.deltacouncil.ca.gov/" rel="nofollow">Bay-Delta
Science Conference</a>.&#xA0;</br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; On Oct. 17, she will chair a <a href="http://scienceconf.deltacouncil.ca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BD12ProgramFinal_091812.pdf" rel="nofollow">panel</a> at the conference on the topic, &#x201C;Not Just
a Pretty Picture: The Synergy between Art and Science.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>
<p>That evening, an exhibition featuring the work of six artists
she curated for the conference as well as &#x201C;The West&#x201D; will open at
the Sacramento Convention Center.</p>
