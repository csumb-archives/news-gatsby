powerful tool for change, disseminating ideas and inspiring people
to act.</img></p>
<p>Sea Change, an exhibit at the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive
Center,&#xA0;is doing just that &#x2014; with the aim of bringing together
art and concern for climate change.</p>
<p>Enid Baxter Blader, chair of the Teledramatic Arts and
Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay, served as guest curator
for the exhibit. It includes a diverse collection of contemporary
projects by artists, architects and scientists who explore the
shifting interactions of land and sea &#x2013; specifically, the rising
sea level in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.</p>
<p>She was invited to curate the show by &#x201C;a wonderful and respected
group, WEAD (Women&#x2019;s Environmental Art Directory,&#x201D; Blader said.</p>
<p>Lauren Elder, a WEAD board member, &#x201C;was a true partner in
creating this exhibition which we have been working on for a
year.&#x201D;</p>

on a number of science and art participatory exhibitions. In the
last two years, she has curated or co-curated exhibitions at the
Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento; the Armory Center for the Arts in
Pasadena; and the prestigious Bay-Delta Science Conference in 2012,
where she organized the conference&#x2019;s first-ever arts exhibit, gave
a plenary talk on science and art to 1,800 scientists and chaired a
related panel.</img></p>
<p>Since her childhood growing up in a mining town &#x2013; where she
watched a mountain get razed &#x2013; she has been interested in the
intersections of landscape, history and community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All of my work resonates with these themes &#x2013; <a href="http://fortording.com/" rel="nofollow">plantord</a>, <a href="http://www.watercalifornia.org/" rel="nofollow">waterca</a>,
<a href="http://www.local909er.com/" rel="nofollow">local909ers</a>. So do the workshops I founded through
the <a href="http://www.montereybayfilmsociety.org/" rel="nofollow">Monterey Bay Film Society</a>,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;People,
ecology and history.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She makes work about &#x201C;where I live or where I&#x2019;m invited to
investigate. I love people, histories and landscapes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have a mind for science as an artist, and many scientists
have a mind for art. There is a deep kinship there.&#x201D;</p>
