<p>Grab your blankets and pillows and head to the forest.<br>
<br>
The Forest Theater Guild will host a stellar&#xA0;<img alt="From the film &apos;Blue&apos; by Leanna Munoz" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/blue.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:225px">selection of CSU
Monterey Bay student films at this year&#x2019;s Carmel Short Cinema
Festival on July 14 at the outdoor Forest Theater. The showing will
begin at sunset. Admission is $10. The program is about an hour
long.</img></br></br></p>
<p>This year&#x2019;s festival will feature eight professional-quality
film productions spanning genres, including narrative, animated,
and experimental works. The collection represents the Cinematic
Arts&#x2019; best program yet, with works inspiring a wide range of
emotional responses.<br>
<br>
For example, In &#x201C;Please Tell Someone, Dear,&#x201D; writer, editor and
director Margo Flitcraft tells a heartbreaking story about sexual
assault in the military and coping with PTSD. In &#x201C;Big Sur,&#x201D;
exceptional cinematographer Stephen Miller shows just why that
landscape is so treasured. Danny Orona&#x2019;s &#x201C;Sisyphus&#x201D; is a complex,
riveting psychological thriller. &#x201C;Boredom Under Fire,&#x201D; created by
Rachel Kellum, Serena Bramble and Michael Marks-Nino, is a comic
wartime foxhole drama. And &#x201C;Blue&#x201D; is a delicately handmade
stop-frame animation about the unexpected joy for creativity.<br>
<br>
Please note that some films in the program contain mature language
or violence and are not appropriate for young children.<br>
<br>
Tickets can be purchased at the door. The program is expected to
start around 8:30 p.m. Spectators are advised to wear warm clothing
and may want to bring a blanket. Concessions will be available. The
Forest Theater is located at the corner of Mountain View and Santa
Rita streets near downtown Carmel. For information, visit <a href="http://www.foresttheaterguild.org./" title="http://www.foresttheaterguild.org./">http://www.foresttheaterguild.org./</a><br>
