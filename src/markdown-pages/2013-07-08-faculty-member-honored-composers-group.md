It&#x2019;s been a productive year for CSU Monterey Bay music lecturer
Lanier Sammons. During the last 12 months, he&#x2019;s won awards from two
national organizations and been chosen an artist-in-residence by a
Santa Cruz museum.<br>
<br>
His composition, <em>D.C. Home</em>, won a top honor in the Young
Composers Competition sponsored by the National Association of
Composers/U.S.A.</br></br></br></p>
<p>The idea for the percussion quartet originated on a train trip
from New York to Charlottesville, Va. With nothing else to do, he
stared out the window, &#x201C;and was rewarded with a striking scene,&#x201D; he
said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;In the sky, a warm, ochre sun sat nearly motionless even as the
train sped on. Along the horizon below the sun, a farmhouse slowly
plodded past. The fields stretching toward me in front of the house
accelerated to a gallop. Finally, just in front of my eyes, a thin
layer of pines zipped by in a deep green blur. What I saw was
undeniably a landscape, but it was undeniably not tranquil; each
layer resolutely moved by at its own speed, refusing to coalesce
into a unified, pastoral image.&#x201D;<br>
D.C. Home marks his attempt at realizing this experience in musical
terms. Like the scene out his train window, &#x201C;the music moves in
layers, each of which possesses its own temporal identity,&#x201D; he
said.</br></br></br></p>
<p>And, he has been selected for the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and
History&#x2019;s new participatory performing artist-in-residence program.
His eight-week residency will culminate with the premiere of a new
composition at the museum&#x2019;s Santa Cruz Music Festival on Aug.
16.<br>
<br>
Dr. Sammons, a composer and guitarist, teaches analogue mixing and
digital editing as well as the Music and Performing Arts capstone
class and master classes.<br>
<br>
His music explores ideas such as audience interactivity,
improvisation, the intersection of popular and classical music, and
the pairing of electronic and acoustic sound. As a performer, he
explores multiple genres on electric guitar, classical guitar and
other instruments.<br>
<br>
He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Columbia University and a
master&#x2019;s and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.<br>
<br>
His research interests include composition and audience-interactive
music, the relationship between play and composition, new music for
the guitar, and the intersection and overlap between &quot;popular&quot;
music and &quot;art&quot; music.<br>
<br>
Last year, he was the recipient of an ASCAP Plus Award in the
concert music division.&#xA0;The award is given by the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and is based on the
unique value of each composer&#x2019;s catalog of original compositions as
well as recent performances.<br>
According to the organization, the grants support the growth and
development of the nation&#x2019;s musical future.<br>
