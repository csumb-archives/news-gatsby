<p>Class work is done in class, homework is done at home. That&apos;s
the way it&apos;s always been. But imagine that model flipped: the
traditional classroom experience &#x2013; like sitting through a lecture &#x2013;
happens at home, while homework is done in class. It&apos;s called the
&quot;inverted classroom,&quot; and it&apos;s a strategy more colleges, including
CSUMB, are using.<br>
