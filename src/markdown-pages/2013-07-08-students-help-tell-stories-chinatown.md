<h3>Grant funds development of oral history walking tour</h3>
<p>For six years, Professor Rina Benmayor&#x2019;s students at CSU
Monterey Bay have worked to preserve memories of the Chinatown area
of Salinas.</p>
<p><img alt="Sign on the Republic Cafe on Soledad Street has been refurbished" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/chop_suey_sign_sm.jpg" style="float:right; width:200px; height:267px">In partnership
with the non-profit Asian Cultural Experience, students in her Oral
History and Community Memory service learning classes have
designed, conducted and archived oral histories focused on life
stories and Chinatown memories of members of the Chinese, Japanese,
Filipino and Latino communities.</img></p>
<p>Those memories will be the basis for &#x201C;Imagine Salinas Chinatown:
An Oral History Walking Tour,&#x201D; thanks to a $10,000 grant from Cal
Humanities. The grant was awarded as part of the non-profit
organization&#x2019;s effort to collect, preserve, interpret and share the
stories of California communities.</p>
<p>The grant will fund design and development of an interactive
website as well as the on-site walking tour. By using the oral
stories, the walking tour will convey the lived experience of the
people and communities that have comprised this historic
neighborhood.</p>
<p>Audio and video footage of the oral histories will be edited
into mini-documentaries and &#x201C;pinned&#x201D; to particular sites on the
Google map of Chinatown &#x2013; existing buildings as well as empty lots
that once housed families and businesses.</p>
<p>The website will also contain historical information, longer
interviews and additional images. As people walk through the
neighborhood with a mobile device, they will be able to hear the
stories and &#x201C;experience&#x201D; the past.</p>
<p class="pullquote">Chinatown for me was a blighted down-and-out
skid row. Now, it is a place with a richly layered past.<br>
&#x2013; David Lansford, former student</br></p>
<p>The walking tour will be one of the permanent public exhibitions
of the future Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum, to be
housed in the Republic Cafe, now a federally designated
landmark.<br>
<br>
Dr. Benmayor&apos;s students from Salinas often say they had no idea
that Chinatown had such a vibrant history. Knowing this history
sheds new light on other immigrant experiences, they say.</br></br></p>
<p>Since 2008, more than 90 students have participated in the
project, generating primary historical material that is permanently
archived in the CSUMB Oral History and Community Memory Archive.
Eventually, the material will be archived in the Salinas Chinatown
Cultural Center and Museum.</p>
