of Chicago for the gentler breezes of Monterey Bay, Jeff Perry, the
celebrated co-founder of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, has again
assembled a tremendous ensemble of artists for Steppenwolf Classes
West &#x2013; instructing, engaging and inspiring the next generation of
artists enrolled in California State University Summer Arts.</img></br></p>
<p>Perry brings tremendous performance experience as a member of
Tony award-winning casts of <em>August: Osage County</em> and
<em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. <em>August: Osage County</em> also
secured a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The opportunity for our Summer Arts&#x2019; students to work with Jeff
and members of the world-renowned Steppenwolf Theatre Company
though their Steppenwolf Classes West program is truly remarkable,&#x201D;
said John Mayer, chair of the Theatre Department at CSU Stanislaus.
&#x201C;This once-in-a-lifetime experience deeply affects students as both
collaborative artists and human beings.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The first Steppenwolf Classes West at CSU Summer Arts program
was offered in 2002, when Perry, Sheldon Patinkin and Kim
Rubenstein conducted a two-week intensive workshop coordinated by
Mayer.&#xA0;Due to the success of the program and the student
demand, the workshop was repeated in 2005, 2008, 2010 (as a
month-long workshop), 2011 and now again for an entire month in
2013.</p>
<p class="pullquote"><em>Tribes</em> is a smart, lively new play
that asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as in
speech.<br>
&#x2013; <em>New York Times</em></br></p>
<p>On July 24, the Steppenwolf program will present the play
<em>Tribes</em>, starring Perry, which had <a href="http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/theater/reviews/tribes-by-nina-raines-at-the-barrow-street-theater.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1373578403-Tjpo0TeR2B8l8DKVM6VIIg" rel="nofollow">a wonderful run in New York in 2012</a>; and, on
July 20, the classic play <em>Love Letters</em>, featuring Evelyn
Carol Case and Mayer.</p>
<p>The Steppenwolf co-founder is not alone in distinction among CSU
Summer Arts masters. This year, a cadre of celebrated guest artists
is providing real-life perspective of their industry along with
artistic instruction. For more information, including a list of
