<h3><strong>SPACE-AGE TECHNOLOGY HELPS GROWERS MANAGE
WATER</strong></h3>

<p>It&apos;s no secret that water drives California agriculture.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons &#x2013; a growing urban population, more
water allocations for endangered species, climate change, a smaller
snowpack in the Sierra &#x2013; the state&apos;s water supply is expected to
shrink in coming years, forcing growers to use it even more
efficiently.<br>
<br>
Faculty members from CSU Monterey Bay have teamed with engineers
and scientists from NASA and other partners to help growers do just
that.<br>
<br>
They are using remote sensing and modeling tools to estimate
irrigation needs at the Constellation Vineyards (formerly the
Mondavi vineyards) in the Napa Valley and at multiple sites
throughout the San Joaquin Valley.<br>
<br>
After full-scale pilot project this year, the system will be ready
for use with a range of crops in other areas&#xA0;of the
state.<br>
<br>
The key is images taken by satellites circling the earth, passing
over California regularly. The condition of crops revealed in the
imagery can assist farmers in determining when and how much to
irrigate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&quot;Certainly many growers in California are highly efficient with
water use already,&quot; said Forrest Melton, a senior research
scientist at CSU Monterey Bay, who is working with NASA Ames on the
irrigation project.</p>
<p>&quot;By providing information on current crop conditions, we hope to
support farmers in continuing to get the most value out of the
water available.&quot;</p>
<p>Melton said that many farmers currently receive updates from the
California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS),
operated by the state Department of Water Resources. CIMIS provides
weather information and valuable daily estimates of baseline or
&quot;reference&quot; evaporation and transpiration, which can be used to
determine when and how much water crops need.</p>
<p>But translating the information from CIMIS for use in
schedulinig irrigation can require additional calculations and the
use of look-up tables, according to Melton, which don&apos;t fully
account for year-to-year variations in growing conditions. NASA&apos;s
satellites will be able to provide this information, along with
forecasts of precipitation and soil moisture calculated from models
running on CSUMB, NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) computers.</p>
<p>Growers can access that information on their laptops or cell
phones. Tapping into information from the NASA satellites and
computer models &#x2013; which will take into account irrigation
information, weather data, crop types and soil conditions &#x2013; will
give growers strategic guidance regarding water use.<br>
<br>
Dr. Lars Pierce of CSUMB says the primary contribution of the
researchers has been to bring together several sources of
information and&#xA0;technologies&#xA0;that growers use to estimate
their water needs, automating the process of mapping those needs.
That makes it easier to interpret and use the information.</br></br></p>
<p>Partners in the project include CSUMB, NASA&apos;s Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
NASA&apos;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the Western Growers Association, and the
California Department of Water Resources.</p>
