<p>Panetta said the institute will expand, and that he and Sylvia
are in the midst of trying to secure a spot on campus to construct
a new building to host the popular Panetta Lecture Series &#x2013; which
draws political leaders and policy thinkers to the Peninsula to
talk about national and international issues.<br>
