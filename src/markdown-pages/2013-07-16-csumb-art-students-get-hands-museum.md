<p>San Francisco artist Andrew Schoultz has created a mural and a
site-specific installation at the Monterey Museum of Art, with help
from a trio of CSU Monterey Bay art students.</p>
<p>His work, on display at the museum&#x2019;s La Mirada facility through
Nov. 17, is based on local histories of Monterey.</p>

university&#x2019;s Visual and Public Art Department and the museum have
collaborated on projects, and countless students have done
internships there. Last spring, Professor Johanna Poethig recruited
Teryn Thomason and Jorge Amezcua from her painting and mural class
to help with Schoultz&#x2019;s exhibit. The third student, Devin Johnson,
took a more indirect route: he relied on old-fashioned
perseverance.</img></p>
<p>After learning when the artist would be at the museum, Johnson
vowed to show up at 8:30 every morning until he caught someone&apos;s
attention. It didn&apos;t take long. A staff member was quick to respond
to his offer of help and he went to work in late June.</p>
<p>All three students were pleased to have the opportunity.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is the first internship I&#x2019;ve had,&#x201D; Thomason said.
&#x201C;Professor Poethig is a wonderful mentor and has been instrumental
in giving me opportunities within the art community here in
Monterey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thomason assisted Schoultz in setting up his pieces of art.
&#x201C;Most of the work I did was on painting walls with brick d&#xE9;cor, and
smaller layers of brick work on the sides of mural panels within
the largest room of the museum,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p><img alt="Devin Johnson with a part of the exhibit he helped install" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/devin_johnson_1.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:400px">She also filled in
large patches of off-white color to sections of the mural that
Schoultz then filled in.</img></p>
<p>Amezcua had worked on large-scale murals before, but &#x201C;being able
to work with an artist like Andrew was a very motivating
experience,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I have admired his work, especially his
murals in San Francisco, so being able to put a face to the work
was surreal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His part of the project involved prep materials for the artist
and adding base layers of paint to large-scale pieces.<br>
<br>
Among other tasks, Johnson painted in parts of the mural that
Schoultz had outlined on the wall.</br></br></p>
<p>It was a learning experience for all of them.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s always enriching being exposed to different types of art
and different techniques,&#x201D; Thomason said.</p>
<p>&quot;An important thing I realized was about the inner workings and
business of the art world,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>Schoultz&#x2019;s work is part of the museum&#x2019;s In Process series of
exhibitions that focus on work by contemporary artists and
frequently include ephemeral, site-specific installations. In
Process charts the most current developments in the field of
contemporary art by championing the work of emerging and mid-career
artists.</p>
