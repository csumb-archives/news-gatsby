<p>Two dynamic arts organizations are joining forces.</p>
<p>The Monterey Bay Film Society and the Philip Glass Center for
the Arts, Science and the&#xA0;<img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mb_film_society_logo.jpg" style="float:left; width:201px; height:116px">Environment are
developing a long-term partnership to bring celebration of the arts
and sciences to Monterey County. The first steps in this process
will happen Oct. 2-6 at the Henry Miller Library and Carmel&#x2019;s
Sunset Center when the Film Society&#x2019;s Monterey Bay Film Festival
will become part of the Days and Nights Festival, creating daytime
film programming and workshops to compliment the exquisite nights
of music planned for this year.</img></p>
<p>The festival will feature screenings and workshops by Godfrey
Reggio and musical performances by Philip Glass and others. The
free popular teen film program will be held on Saturday, Oct. 5,
and a free screening and workshop by filmmaker Diego Luna is
tentatively scheduled for Friday, Oct. 4. A number of free tickets
will be made available to Monterey County students.</p>
<p>Full festival programming will be announced in early August.</p>
<p>The Days and Nights Festival, now in its third year, is the
premier program of the Philip Glass Center for the Arts, Science
and the Environment. Developed by Mr. Glass, the festival is
designed to encompass and nurture the arts in a way that welcomes
the future while exploring the seminal developments in the arts
throughout history.</p>

Center is to gather the world&#x2019;s leaders in the fields of art,
science and the environment for a broad array of interdisciplinary
activities including performances, seminars and education programs
that inspire and motivate the public to become engaged with matters
vital to the future of the natural environment and the quality of
human existence.</img></p>
<p>The Monterey Bay Film Festival, under the auspices of the
Monterey Bay Film Society, has grown over its six years to
incorporate films by local and international teen filmmakers and
programming created by creative director Mike Plante of Sundance.
The Monterey Bay Film Society is presented by the Cinematic Arts
and Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay. Focused on
independent, avant-garde and community-based media, the Film
Society works to develop and support the unique voice of our
remarkable communities.<br>
<br>
The Monterey Bay Film Society grew out of the Monterey Bay Film
Festival in 2007, as a response to rising teen violence rates in
Monterey County. Founded by artist and CSUMB Cinematic Arts Chair
Enid Baxter Blader, the film society annually works with over 2,000
teens to develop self-confidence through creative expression, a
sense of place and community connectedness, job-related skills,
exposure to college as a future choice, inspiration from
internationally recognized artists, joy and hope.</br></br></p>
<p>The activities are intergenerational, requiring college students
to engage as mentors, building their own skill sets and sense of
social responsibility, and bringing internationally renowned
artists to the county to teach the college students and youth.</p>
<p>These year-round activities will continue to grow in partnership
with the Glass Center.</p>
