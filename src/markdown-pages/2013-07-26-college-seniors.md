await them.</p>

examination of feminist literature; reptiles and amphibians of
California; satirical anti-war cinema; 20th century painting; and a
look at oceans and their impact on human endeavors.</p>

history by CSUMB professor of anthropology Dr. Umi Vaughan; Fathers
and Daughters: King Lear and The Tempest, taught by former MPC
instructor Allston James; and a lecture by attorney and law school
professor Michael Stamp that will preview the issues to be
presented in the Monterey College of Law&#x2019;s moot court competition
the following week.</p>
<p>Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a three-session
class, California Renewal: Economic Recovery, Policy Initiatives,
Political Trajectory, that will take a look at the trajectory of
politics in the Golden State.</p>
<p>Also offered are a Distinguished Lecture Series, including a
talk by CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa on Sept. 18. His topic: &#x201C;A
Call for Excellence.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s also a free lecture series, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s
