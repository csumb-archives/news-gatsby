<p>Two CSUMB students were behind the free soccer program run out
of the Cesar Chavez Library in Salinas. &quot;They are athletes who used
soccer as their pathway to higher education. Each recognizes the
value of athletics as an opportunity to gain admittance to a
university,&quot; said library technology manager Carissa Purnell.
&quot;Originally they came to complete their community service hours,
but fell in love with the students, their families and the
community. They took the initiative to apply for grant
funding.&quot;<br>
