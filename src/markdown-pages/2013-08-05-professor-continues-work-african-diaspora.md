<p>Professor <a href="http://umiart.com/" rel="nofollow">Umi
Vaughan</a> continues to explore the African diaspora with his work
on a dance festival and symposium this month in San
Francisco.<br>
<br>
Dr. Vaughan, a faculty member in the Division of Humanities and
Communication, is one of the curators and a panel moderator for
Performing Diaspora at the CounterPULSE theater.</br></br></p>
<p>The festival features dance, music, theater, media and
interdisciplinary artists who use traditional forms as a basis for
experimentation and innovation.<br>
<br>
The symposium, set for Aug. 10, will kick off the three weekends of
events. Performances will follow Aug. 15-18 and Aug. 22-25.<br>
<br>
The symposium will feature a discussion of the complexities of
African dance, practice, production and teaching in the Bay Area
and explore how artists address injustice and violence through
their performances. Dr. Vaughan will moderate a panel titled
&#x201C;Spirit Moves: Sacred Dance Onstage.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Vaughan is also one of two featured artists in an upcoming
exhibit in Oakland to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.<br>
<br>
Called &#x201C;Ritmo Negro: Visions of Afro-Latin America,&#x201D; the exhibit
will be on display at the East Bay Municipal Utility District
office during September and October. In October, he will give a
talk about the African diaspora in Latin America, based on
photographs in his books.<br>
