<h4>About 100 CSUMB students to study abroad; a dozen earn Gilman
scholarships</h4>
<p><img alt="Ayana Hawk" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ayana.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:199px">Ayana Hawk is not
your typical study-abroad student. She&#x2019;s majoring in film, not
social sciences or business &#x2014; the most popular fields among
students studying abroad. And she&#x2019;s African-American, which,
according to the Institute of International Education, puts her
among 4.8 percent of students who study overseas.<br>
<br>
Hawk will be taking an intensive language program at a university
in southern Spain this coming school year, thanks to a scholarship
aimed at getting more underrepresented students to study abroad.
The scholarship also encourages applicants to look beyond
traditionally popular destinations such as Italy or Australia.</br></br></img></p>
<p>Hawk, of Culver City, is one of 12 CSUMB students to receive the
Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for the coming
year.<br>
<br>
The Gilman scholarship recipients reflect a more diverse pool, with
17 percent being Hispanic and 15 percent Asian or Pacific Islander.
Nearly a third of them go to Asia, compared with about a tenth of
traditional study-abroad students. The scholarship is sponsored by
the U.S. State Department and administered by the Institute of
International Education.<br>
<br>
The competitive program offers grants of $5,000 to help defray the
costs of tuition, room and board, books, local transportation,
insurance and airfare. The program awarded more than 850
scholarships to undergraduates for the 2013-14 academic year.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;It is a wonderful opportunity for these students,&#x201D; said CSUMB&#x2019;s
international programs manager Holly White, who has seen a
significant number of CSUMB students earn the scholarship over the
last few years. Last fall, 13 CSUMB students received them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Like the other scholarship winners, Hawk, 19, who will be a
junior in the fall, would not be able to study abroad without the
financial support the program provides. The trip is one she has
dreamed of for years.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The reason why I decided to study abroad is because I knew there
is more to the world than what I am currently living and
experiencing,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Growing up, I remember watching the Olympics and seeing all these
countries I&#x2019;d never even heard of. I knew there was more than what
I knew outside my home. There was a whole world.&#x201D;&#xA0;<br>
<br>
While she will study only Spanish, she plans to explore current
events and political issues in the country via filmmaking. She&#x2019;s
interested in the plight of African immigrants who work in the
fields and as street vendors; some blame them for Spain&#x2019;s current
economic crisis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The belief that international study better prepares American
students to assume significant roles in an increasingly global
economy and interdependent world is central to the vision of
CSUMB&#x2019;s Office of International Programs.<br>
<br>
In the academic year just concluded, 110 students spent at least a
semester studying abroad. For the 2013-14 academic year,
approximately the same number will spent one or two semesters
studying in another country.<br>
