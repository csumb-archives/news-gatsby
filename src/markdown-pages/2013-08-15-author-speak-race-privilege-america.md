<p>Anti-racism activist and educator Tim Wise will discuss white
privilege and how it ultimately harms its beneficiaries when he
visits CSU Monterey Bay on Sept. 18.</p>
<p><img alt="Tim Wise" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/wise_photo.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:317px">His lecture will be
held from 7 to 9 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue and
B Street. Tickets &#x2013; $10 for the public and free to CSUMB students,
faculty and staff with Otter ID &#x2013; will be available at the door.
Visitors must purchase a parking permit from the machine located on
the parking lot.&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>Wise will examine what it means to be white in a nation created
for the benefit of those who are &#x201C;white like him,&#x201D; and how
privilege seeps into every institutional arrangement, from
education to employment to the justice system.</p>
<p>Through storytelling and analysis, he makes the case that racial
inequity and white privilege are real and persistent threats to
personal and collective well-being, but resistance to white
supremacy and racism is possible.</p>
<p>Wise has been called &#x201C;one of the most brilliant, articulate and
courageous critics of white privilege in the nation.&#x201D; He has
appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs, is a regular
contributor to discussions about race on CNN, and has appeared on
ABC&apos;s 20/20.</p>
<p>He is the author of six books including &#x201C;White Like Me:
Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son&#x201D; and &#x201C;Colorblind: The
Rise of Post-Racial Politics and the Retreat from Racial
Equity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A question-and-answer session and a book signing will follow the
talk.</p>
<p>The Otter Cross Cultural Center, Otter Student Union, Associated
Students and the Service Learning Institute are co-sponsors of the
lecture.</p>
