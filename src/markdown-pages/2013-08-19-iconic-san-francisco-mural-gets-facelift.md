<h3>Artist recruits students to help with project</h3>
<p>Johanna Poethig has been making public art in San Francisco
since the 1980s. This summer, the professor in CSUMB&#x2019;s Visual and
Public Art Department is &#x201C;re-making&#x201D; a mural she created in 1992,
and employing students in the effort.</p>
<p><img alt="The mural before restoration efforts" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/original_mural_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:525px; height:373px">Staff members from
the San Francisco Human Services Agency contacted her about
restoring her mural, &#x201C;To Cause to Remember,&#x201D; better known as the
Statue of Liberty mural. It&#x2019;s located on the side of a homeless
shelter in the city&#x2019;s South of Market district.</img></p>
<p>On the 40-foot by 80-foot wall, Lady Liberty lies on her side
with chains on her feet and her hand outstretched.</p>
<p>Poethig said on her <a href="http://johannapoethig.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/statue-of-liberty-mural-restoration/" rel="nofollow">blog</a>:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everyone who comments on the mural mentions the chains first of
all. . . . This symbol, the fallen Liberty, speaks to the issues of
poverty, immigration, mental illness, incarceration, drugs, war
veterans, families and the elderly.</p>
<p><img alt="Artist Johanna Poethig lanked by Jorge Amezcua, Matthew Floriani " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/students_jo_at_mural_for_web.jpg" style="float:right; width:450px; height:480px">&#x201C;The image has
been published in books about street art. In my 30-year career as a
muralist and public artist, this work of art has weathered the test
of time. The Liberty in recline has proven herself to really mean
something to the people who live with her chains and to those who
remember what she means.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Poethig enlisted the help of her students Matthew Floriani and
Jorge Amezcua. It&#x2019;s not the first foray into public art for
Floriani &#x2013; for his capstone project, he created <a href="../../may/16/art-students-work-adorns-skate-park.html" rel="nofollow">a mural for the Marina Skate Park</a>. And he took a
page from Poethig&#x2019;s book by enlisting the help of youngsters from
the Marina Teen Center and Los Arboles Middle School.</p>
<p>Floriani had never worked on scaffolding or on such a large
project. &quot;I learned how to work with a team . . . and I learned to
work quickly and precisely,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was also Amezcua&apos;s first experience working on such a large
scale. And while he&#xA0;spent some time earlier this summer
helping with&#xA0;<a href="../../jul/14/csumb-art-students-get-hands-museum.html" rel="nofollow">a project at the Monterey Museum of Art</a>, he had
never worked on a restoration. He learned a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>&quot;As an artist, I have always wanted complete control of every
detail of my projects. But the more I get into pubic art, the more
I realize . . . the amount of work that goes into large scale
murals is so great in terms of physical demand and danger that
there is simply no way to do it without a crew.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&quot;As crewmembers, it is our job to realize the artist&apos;s vision
and that includes working from the artist&apos;s design,&quot; he said. &quot;It
feels good to have an artist like Johanna trust me enough to work
with her crew.&quot;</p>
