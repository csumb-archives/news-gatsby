Eastern European dancers and musicians bring their rich and
colorful artistic traditions to the local area for the first
time.</img></p>
<p>The evening&#x2019;s program, Hungarian Rhapsody, is a spirited journey
through time, tracing the history of this thousand-year-old culture
through its dance and music.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1951, the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble
has revitalized the folk culture of the Hungarian people. Its
repertoire is based on authentic dances, some collected from
isolated villages.</p>

extraordinary folk music &#x2013; which inspired Liszt, Brahms, Bart&#xF3;k and
Kod&#xE1;ly &#x2013; performed live by the talented Folk Orchestra. Don&#x2019;t miss
this performance infused with dance, acrobatics, grace, lyricism
and passion.</p>

<p><em>The Hungarian State Folk Ensemble has a special character.
Behind the crackling vitality of its dancers&apos; heel-clicking male
bravado and rushing sweep of feminine exuberance lies an unusual
fusion of high culture and popular traditions.</em><br>
