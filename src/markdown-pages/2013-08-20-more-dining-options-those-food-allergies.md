<p>Starting this semester, food allergy sufferers at CSU Monterey
Bay will have an easier time finding meals that work for them.</p>
<p>Simple Servings, a station located in the Dining Commons, will
provide healthy and tasty meals at lunch and dinner for those who
can&#x2019;t tolerate gluten, soy, dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, eggs or
shellfish.</p>
<p><img alt="Simple Servings logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/simple-servings-logo-by-sdx.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:116px">Implemented at
several universities in the fall of 2012 as a pilot program for
Sodexo, the university&#x2019;s food service provider, Simple Servings
will be available at several dozen schools this fall. CSUMB is the
first university in California to offer it.</img></p>
<p>Lunch and dinner menus will change daily and include beef,
chicken, pork, turkey and fin fish as well as vegetarian
dishes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;From Carolina pulled pork with baked beans to lemon dill
tilapia with basmati rice, students are sure to find something that
satisfies their hunger and their dietary needs,&#x201D; said Tyler
McBrian, marketing and sustainability manager for Campus Dining
Services.</p>
<p>All staff members are taught about the risks of food allergies
and trained to properly handle foods. &#x201C;Everything is cooked
separately using purple-colored utensils to prevent cross
contamination,&#x201D; said executive chef Uriah Paiva. &#x201C;We serve the
students ourselves to ensure that the food is handled
correctly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sodexo points out that Simple Servings meals are also ideal for
diners who are focused on simple ingredients and portion size.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../meatless-monday.html" rel="nofollow">Meatless Monday</a> will continue at all five campus
dining locations this year &#x2013; the Dining Commons, the newly
renovated Otter Express, Starbucks, the library caf&#xE9; and the Otter
Bay Restaurant. The restaurant will be closed during the fall
semester for remodeling.</p>
