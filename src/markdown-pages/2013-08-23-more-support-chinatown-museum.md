<h3>CSUMB faculty members land humanities grant</h3>
<p>A grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities will help
move the Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum another step
closer to reality.</p>
<p>The $40,000 grant will be used to plan and design three public
programs for the future museum.</p>

are:</img></p>
<p>&#x2022; A core historical exhibition for the museum, which will be
housed in the former Republic Caf&#xE9; on Soledad Street</p>
<p>&#x2022; A virtual oral history <a href="../../jul/5/students-help-tell-stories-chinatown.html" rel="nofollow">walking tour of Chinatown</a></p>
<p>&#x2022; A series of intercultural dialogues involving the communities
that have made Chinatown their home over the last 150 years.</p>
<p>All three programs are part of &#x201C;Imaging Salinas Chinatown:
Intercultural Dialogues of History and Meaning.&#x201D; CSU Monterey Bay
professors Rina Benmayor, Amalia Mesa-Bains and Seth Pollack are
co-directors of the project and are working in partnership with the
Asian Cultural Experience, a non-profit organization dedicated to
preserving Chinatown.</p>
<p>The grant will bring national scholars to the planning process,
including Jack Tchen of New York University; Dorothy Fujita-Rony of
UC Irvine; and Tomas Ybarra-Frausto, formerly of the Rockefeller
Foundation. It will also support local scholars from the Chinese,
Japanese, Filipino and Latino communities in Salinas.</p>
<p>In 2010, Dr. Tchen was the keynote speaker at CSUMB&#x2019;s symposium,
<a href="../../../2010/oct/18/asian-cultural-center-will-have-national-significance-speaker-says.html" rel="nofollow">Salinas Chinatown: Once and Again.</a></p>
<p>Chinatown has been a refuge for the hungry and homeless for
decades. Almost from the beginning of the university, students
performed service learning at Dorothy&#x2019;s Place, a soup kitchen and
shelter on Soledad Street. In 2005, the university and Chinatown
stakeholders formed a partnership for renewal. The next year, the
<a href="http://service.csumb.edu/community-garden-park" rel="nofollow">Soledad Street Unity Garden</a> and a community center
opened. In 2011, a <a href="http://wetec.csumb.edu/public-computing-center-salinas-chinatown" rel="nofollow">computer lab and digital literacy classroom</a> was
added to the center.</p>
<p>Over the years, hundreds of service learning students in a
variety of academic disciplines have worked in the area.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Three grants have been awarded for Chinatown historical and
cultural preservation efforts this summer. In addition to the NEH
grant, the Community Foundation for Monterey County made an award
to the Asian Cultural Experience to collect and archive historical
photographs, and Cal Humanities gave $10,000 to create an
interactive website and the walking tour based on work by Professor
Benmayor&apos;s students. Since 2007, her service learning students have
gathered more than 125 hours of Chinatown stories.&#xA0;</p>
