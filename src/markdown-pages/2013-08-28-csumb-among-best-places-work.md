<p>CSU Monterey Bay can claim to be one of the best places to work
in the county &#x2013; for the third time in five years.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s according to the Monterey County Business Council&#x2019;s &quot;Best
Places to Work&quot; study. The purpose of the program is to provide
vital information to local companies about the practices they use
to attract and retain talented employees.<br>

<p>Personal Dynamics Consulting of Florida designed a 40-question
survey used to identify the top employers. Turnover rates, spending
on employee development, insurance packages and retirement plans
were among the 37 measurements used to determine the area&apos;s &quot;Best
Places to Work.&quot;<br>
<br>
Six employers were honored. In addition to CSUMB, Whitson
Engineers, Kennedy Archer and Giffen, Allterra Solar, Salinas
Valley Solid Waste Authority and the Hyatt Regency Monterey were
honored.</br></br></p>
