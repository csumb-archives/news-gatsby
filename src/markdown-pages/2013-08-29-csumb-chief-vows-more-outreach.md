<p>The president of Cal State Monterey Bay vowed to widen the
school&apos;s community outreach by performing some of it himself. . . .
In a state-of-the-university speech delivered just days before
lasses resume for the fall, President Ochoa also said he plans to
broaden the university&apos;s reach into Salinas.<br>
