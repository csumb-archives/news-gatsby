<p>Stephanie Anne Johnson, professor in the Visual and Public Art
Department, has received an award for her work as a lighting
designer.</p>
<p>The Lighting Artists in Dance Award provides funds to support
artistic collaborations with choreographers and dance companies.
Those collaborations will result in dance performances presented in
the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Johnson is working with Anne Bluethenthal &amp; Dancers as the
visual designer for <em>Skywatchers</em>, a multi-disciplinary
performance project that will take place in the Tenderloin
neighborhood.</p>
<p>Working with the Community Housing Partnership and with formerly
homeless residents, Johnson, the dance company and other artists
will create three site-specific performances to be staged this fall
and winter.</p>
<p>For this project, she will combine stage lights, solar units, 35
mm slides and live-feed video projections.</p>
<p>In a lighting design career that spans three decades, Johnson
has designed shows for Cultural Odyssey, Oregon Shakespeare
Festival, Arizona Repertory Theater, La Mama Theater (N.Y.) Black
Moon Theatre (Paris), Dimensions Dance Theater and ABD
Productions.<br>
<br>
Her lighting design work has been seen in India, The Netherlands,
Italy, France and Belgium.<br>
As a visual artist, she has exhibited at Yerba Buena Center for the
Arts, De Young Museum, Jewish Museum, Berkeley Art Museum and
Intersection For The Arts.</br></br></br></p>
