<p>For Jay Carter, participating in a residential community was an
important part of his freshman year on campus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The programs cultivated a community that is genuine,&#x201D; Carter
said of his experience with the program in 2012. &#x201C;The long-lasting
relationships between residents and professors . . . are rich in
spirit . . . &#x201D;</p>

Project Higher Ground &#xAD;&#x2013; a residential community in Avocet Hall
linked to academic coursework and co-curricular activities designed
to enhance student learning and personal development.</img></p>
<p>In its fourth year, Project Higher Ground is made up of student
groups based on academic and personal interests such as math,
computer science, health, ethnic studies and biology.<br>
<br>
Students in each group take a First Year Seminar course that
directly ties with an additional course. For example, students may
take a seminar on Technology and Society that connects with their
section of pre-calculus. Faculty members from both courses work
together to make a seamless transition from one class to the
next.</br></br></p>
<p>Outside of class, peer leaders coordinate activities to
integrate students&#x2019; coursework with campus and community
experiences. This year they look forward to visiting Silicon Valley
and attending the United Nations Film Fesitval held in Monterey, as
well as social activities such as pizza parties in the Avocet
lounge.</p>
<p>The name Project Higher Ground comes from the book, &quot;Moving to
Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life,&quot; in which Pulitzer
Prize-winning musician and educator Wynton Marsalis relates the
principles of jazz to lessons about life.</p>
<p>About 200 students are participating this year, and have a
choice among five First Year Seminar classes: Youth, Power and
Protest; Comparative Ethnic Experiences; Eat, Love, Learn;
Multicultural Health; and Technology and Society. Professors even
hold office hours in the hall.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s Student Life and Academic Affairs divisions,
which co-sponsor Project Higher Ground, have seen an increase in
student satisfaction and academic success as a result of the
program.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Higher Ground has a huge academic impact,&#x201D; said Molly Springer,
coordinator for Living Learning and Themed Programs at CSUMB. &#x201C;And
the students really feel a connection to the campus and to their
peers. That connection is what brings them back&#x201D; for their
sophomore year.&#xA0;</p>
