<p>Over the summer, the campus became a safer place . . . for
victims of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Lifesaving devices called Automated External Defibrillators &#x2013; or
AEDs &#x2013; were installed in a dozen buildings, courtesy of the
University Police Department&#x2019;s Otter Public Access AED Program.</p>
<p>AEDs have proven to save lives when used on a heart attack
victim within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The goal of the university is to provide a safe and healthy
campus for our community members,&#x201D; said Dick Bower, CSUMB&#x2019;s
emergency manager. &#x201C;This new program takes &#x2018;safe and healthy&#x2019; to a
new level with trained people and modern technology in place to
offer rapid, effective treatment to heart attack victims.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They are housed in marked white cabinets in common areas of
these buildings:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Otter Sports Center<br>
&#x2022; Police Department<br>
&#x2022; Alumni and Visitors Center<br>
&#x2022; Dining Commons<br>
&#x2022; Student Center<br>
&#x2022; Chapman Science Academic Center<br>
&#x2022; Tanimura &amp; Antle Library<br>
&#x2022; World Theater<br>
&#x2022; University Center<br>
&#x2022; Osher Lifelong Learning Institute<br>
&#x2022; Information Technology<br>
&#x2022; Student Services<br>
<br>
The AEDs are easy to use, requiring only three steps to hook up and
deliver the shock. Training is available on request.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Training is also offered through monthly First Aid/CPR/AED
classes available for free to the campus community. The classes are
offered in cooperation with American Medical Response, a regional
ambulance company, and CalFIRE.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We thank the university administration, our partners in
Facilities Services and Operations, American Medical Response and
CalFIRE for their assistance in making this program available,&#x201D;
Bower said.</p>
