<p>For the fifth consecutive year, CSU Monterey Bay has been named
a &#x201C;military-friendly school&#x201D; by <a href="http://www.militaryfriendlyschools.com" rel="nofollow">G.I. Jobs
magazine</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Military Friendly School 2014 logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mfs_logo_big.png" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px">The list honors the
top 20 percent of colleges and universities that are doing the most
to embrace America&#x2019;s military members, veterans and spouses as
students and to ensure their success on campus, according to the
magazine&#x2019;s director, Sean Collins. &quot;Inclusion on the list of
military friendly schools shows Cal State Monterey Bay&apos;s commitment
to providing a supportive environment for military students,&quot;
Collins said.</img></p>
<p>The magazine polled more than 10,000 schools nationwide approved
for VA tuition funding in determining the results, examining
criteria such as efforts to recruit and retain military and veteran
students.</p>
<p>Among CSUMB&#x2019;s military-friendly practices are <a href="http://catalog.csumb.edu/services-activities/campus-services/veterans-services" rel="nofollow">web pages with information specifically for
veterans</a>; a designated veterans services liaison and campus
support team to help veterans make the transition from active duty
service to successful educational pursuits; and a Student Veterans
Organization.<br>
<br>
CSUMB has seen an increase in the number of queries and
applications from veterans since the webpages went up and the
veterans&apos; contact was put in place. The number of veterans
contacting the university for pre-admission counseling has
increased, with queries coming from veterans and active-duty
service members across the U.S. and around the world.<br>
<br>
This semester, 51 military veteran students are using GI Bill
education benefits at CSUMB and another 190 students are receiving
state or federal education benefits as the dependent of a
disabled/deceased service member.<br>
