Bay Area-based curator and artist, will visit CSU Monterey Bay on
Sept. 19 as the annual visiting artist series gets under way.</img></p>
<p>Hoover is gallery director and curator at SOMArts, the South of
Market Arts Center in San Francisco. His own work deals with
language failures, migration issues and global translocation
through performance, video and installation art.</p>
<p>His creativity blurs the line between exhibitions, performances,
happenings and community engagement structures.</p>
<p>The public is invited to this free presentation, which will
start at 6 p.m. in the Painting Studio (Bldg. 72), located on
Inter-Garrison Road near the intersection with Fifth Avenue.
