<p>Created by international award-winning animator Kim, <em>Ahco on
the Road</em> is a rich and haunting animation that draws its
inspiration from a nature documentary. Ahco, a baby elephant, is
separated from her mother, and must make a perilous journey to try
to find her way back home. <a href="http://daysandnightsfestival.com/festival/ahco-on-the-road/" rel="nofollow">Read more about the film here</a>.<br>

Directed by international independent filmmaker Camara (and
starring his son and wife, who also co-wrote the script),

immersion into the imagination of a child whose mother is about to
abandon him. Drawn into a restaging of the Don Juan story in
Qeuratero, Mexico, the characters navigate a world re-arranged by a
child&#x2019;s consciousness. <a href="http://daysandnightsfestival.com/festival/silencio-film/" rel="nofollow">Read more about the film here</a>.</img></br></br></p>

<p>Last summer, the Monterey Bay Film Society and the Philip Glass
Center formed a partnership. As a result, the Film Society&#x2019;s
Monterey Bay Film Festival has become part of the Glass Center&#x2019;s
annual Days and Nights Festival, with programming scheduled for
Oct. 2-6 at the Henry Miller Library and Carmel&#x2019;s Sunset
Center.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The festival will feature screenings and workshops by Godfrey
Reggio, musical performances by Philip Glass and others at the
Sunset Center and the Henry Miller library, where the Glass
ensemble will accompany a screening of Reggio&#x2019;s classic film,
<em>Powaqqatsi</em>, on Oct. 2.<br>
<br>
On Friday, Oct. 4, at 1 p.m. at Sunset Center, <em>Rebels With a
Cause</em>, a documentary about the successful movement of Bay Area
community members to protect open space, will be screened.<br>
The Homegrown Films program will follow at 3 p.m., featuring the
films by Kim and Camara.</br></br></br></p>
<p>The popular teen film program will be held on Saturday, Oct. 5
at 1 p.m., and will be followed by a screening of <em>William and
the Windmill</em>, a documentary about a Malawian teen who saved
his village by creating a windmill.<br>
<br>
All the film programs are free, and have limited seating. All the
filmmakers will be present to speak following the films. Student
tickets are available by e-mailing <a href="mailto:eblader@csumb.edu">eblader@csumb.edu</a>.<br>

The Days and Nights Festival, now in its third year, is the premier
program of the Glass Center. The festival is designed to encompass
and nurture the arts in a way that welcomes the future while
exploring the seminal developments in the arts throughout
history.<br>
<br>
The mission of the Center is to gather the world&#x2019;s leaders in the
fields of art, science and the environment for a broad array of
interdisciplinary activities including performances, seminars, and
education programs that inspire and motivate the public to become
engaged with matters vital to the future of the natural environment
and the quality of human existence.<br>
<br>
The Monterey Bay Film Festival has grown over its six-year history
to incorporate films by local and international teen filmmakers and
programming created by creative director, Mike Plante of Sundance.
The Monterey Bay Film Society is presented by the Cinematic Arts
and Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay. Focused on
independent, avant-garde and community-based media, the Film
Society works to develop and support the unique voice of our
remarkable communities.<br>
<br>
The Monterey Bay Film Society grew out of the Monterey Bay Film
Festival in 2007, as a response to rising teen violence rates in
Monterey County. Founded by artist and CSUMB Cinematic Arts Chair,
Enid Baxter Ryce, the film society annually works with over 2,000
teens to develop self-confidence through creative expression, a
sense of place and community connectedness, job-related skills,
exposure to college as a future choice, inspiration from
internationally recognized artists, joy and hope.<br>
<br>
The activities are intergenerational, requiring college students to
engage as mentors, building their own skill sets and sense of
social responsibility, and bringing internationally renowned
artists to the county to teach the college students and
youth.<br>
<br>
These year-round activities will continue to grow in partnership
with the Glass Center.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
