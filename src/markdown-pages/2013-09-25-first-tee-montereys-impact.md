<p>. . . College students from Cal State Monterey Bay have a unique
opportunity, thanks to the First Tee of Monterey. &quot;We have
first-generation students to go to college provided scholarships
from local individuals and foundations with the hope that they will
stay local and become leaders in the community once they graduate
from CSUMB.&quot;<br>
