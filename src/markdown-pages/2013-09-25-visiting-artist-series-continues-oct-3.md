visiting artist series continues Oct. 3 when San Francisco Bay Area
curator, critic and educator Anuradha Vikram visits campus.</img></p>
<p>Her presentation will get under way at 6 p.m. in the University
Center living room.</p>
<p>Vikram has curated exhibitions for the Craft and Folk Art Museum
in Los Angeles, Mills College Art Museum in Oakland, the DeYoung
Museum Artist Studio in San Francisco and, until recently, served
as curator of the Worth Ryder Art Gallery for UC Berkeley&#x2019;s
Department of Art Practice.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, she has made exhibitions and programs that
bridge institutional spaces with other spaces of culture and public
life. As a curator of interdisciplinary exhibitions and public
programs, she collaborates with artists to inspire dialogue on
issues of social concern and to inform space with tangible evidence
of the charged relationships between people.</p>
<p>She has developed programming that fosters interaction between
artists and members of the public, including experts in
environmental, legal, technological, scientific and civic areas, as
well as general audiences.</p>
<p>Through these strategies, she engages audiences at every level
of art education with the ideas and formal concepts that shape the
art of our times.</p>
<p>The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street.
