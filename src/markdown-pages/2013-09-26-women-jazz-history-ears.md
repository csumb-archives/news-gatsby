Pamela Rose has been described by Downbeat Magazine as &quot;playful,
sure and sassy.&quot;</img></p>
<p>That&apos;s what an ongoing successful run of the multi-media &quot;Wild
Women of Song: Great Gal Composers of the Jazz Era&quot; does for a
person. In Los Angeles, London, New York and San Francisco, Rose
has entertained, enlightened and educated audiences about the
mostly anonymous female songwriters from the early days of
jazz.</p>
<p>She will bring the show to CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater on
Oct. 17. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>With dramatic projected images, and superb storytelling, Rose
delivers a cultural retrospective while treating the audience to a
live jazz and blues concert.</p>
<p>She is no stranger to the local area. In 2011, the show was
featured at the Monterey Jazz Festival.<br>
<br>
The Los Angeles native immersed herself in jazz over the past two
decades, but she can belt sassy golden age blues by Alberta Hunter
and Ida Cox as easily as a torchy Peggy Lee lament. Completing the
package, Rose also throws her own well-crafted originals into the
mix.</br></br></p>
<p>The music is accompanied by a slide show of pictures of the
songwriters and a script that provides details of the composers&apos;
lives. The result is something far more meaningful than just a
pleasant evening of music.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s like putting on a play,&quot; Rose told the San Jose Mercury
News in 2011. &quot;We are sort of reconstructing this era for
people.&quot;</p>

artistic director Joe Cardinalli: &quot;What really hooked me on
presenting Pamela Rose at the World Theater was listening to her
album &apos;Wild Women of Song.&apos; Every song was written by a woman. The
songs brought back childhood memories of my mother singing them in
the kitchen in our home in Monterey.&quot;</img></p>

<em>Her multimedia show is equal parts concert and history lesson.
Rose and her talented band routinely draw rave reviews from fans
and critics ... notably, her set at the Monterey Jazz Festival had
people buzzing!</em><br>
