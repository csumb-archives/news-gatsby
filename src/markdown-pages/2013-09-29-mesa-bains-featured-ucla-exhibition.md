<p>The <a href="http://www.fowler.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow">Fowler
Museum</a> at UCLA will honor its 50th anniversary with special
exhibitions starting this fall, and a former CSU Monterey Bay
professor is part of the celebration.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fowler.ucla.edu/exhibitions/fowler-at-fifty-new-world-wunderkammer" rel="nofollow">Fowler at Fifty</a> will include eight exhibitions
that will be installed in two large galleries; all spotlight
strengths in the Fowler&#x2019;s collections of art from Africa, the
Pacific and the Americas and highlight works shown for the first
time.</p>
<p><img alt="Amalia Mesa-Bains" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/amalia_at_fowler.jpg" style="float:left; width:288px; height:247px">Amalia Mesa-Bains,
former chair of the<a href="http://csumb.edu/art" rel="nofollow">Visual and Public Art Department</a> and professor
emeritus, will work with the Fowler collections to create &quot;New
World Wunderkammer,&quot; which will include three Cabinets of Curiosity
focused on the Americas, Africa, and the Colonial works of the New
World.</img></p>
<p>In several installations over two decades, Dr. Mesa-Bains has
worked to intervene in and disrupt the earlier European foundations
of collecting.</p>
<p>The New World Wunderkammer will be the first time she has been
able to use a major collection to recontextualize objects within
themes of memory, struggle, loss and wonder, according to <a href="http://wunderkammern1.wordpress.com/about-amalia-mesa-bains/" rel="nofollow">her blog</a>.</p>
<p>Within each cabinet, guardian figures will anchor the narratives
of critical artifacts. Each cabinet will also contain a blessing
space with significant spiritual objects.</p>
<p>The larger Wunderkammer will engage the viewer in a setting much
like a laboratory with archeological specimens and natural
phenomenon. Dr. Mesa-Bains will weave through the installation
fragments of her own mementos from previous art works.</p>
<p>The room will be completed by eight new prints based on key
pieces from the collection. The artifacts will be layered in the
prints with botanical, cartographic and historical photographic
references.</p>
<p>This theater of wonder animates the cultural landscape and human
geography of the New World through objects of beauty and power.</p>
<p>The exhibits open Oct. 13 and will remain on display until Jan.
26. Dr. Mesa-Bains will give an artist&#x2019;s talk at 2 p.m. on opening
day.</p>

exhibit</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Mesa-Bains also has a featured article in the
inaugural edition of <a href="http://macs-review.com/" rel="nofollow">Museum and Curatorial Studies Review</a>, a
peer-reviewed journal that published its first issue this
summer.</p>
<p>Her essay, The Latino Cabinet of Curiosities: A Postcolonial
Reopening, re-examines the roles of artists who make use of
curatorial strategies within community and museum settings.<br>
