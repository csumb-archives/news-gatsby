<h3>Group works to connect with cultural clubs</h3>
<p>They have no memories of the civil-rights milestones of the
mid-1960s, but that didn&#x2019;t prevent students at Cal State Monterey
Bay from starting a campus chapter of the NAACP last year.</p>
<p><img alt="Charter members of CSUMB&apos;s student chapter of the NAACP" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/small_naacp_photo_for_web_1.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:149px">At the chapter&#x2019;s
inaugural meeting in September of 2013, students heard community
members &#x2013; all veterans of the civil rights struggle &#x2013; talk about
the movement&#x2019;s history and urge them to continue the work.</img></p>
<p>The students took that message to heart.</p>
<p>Chapter president Shiyla Goodie, a psychology major from Los
Angeles, named voter suppression and the student vote as one of the
chapter&#x2019;s biggest concerns. Last year, the group worked to register
voters before the presidential election, and members continue to
educate their peers on the importance of voting. But that&#x2019;s not
their only focus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This year, our mission is to connect with cultural clubs and
organizations to educate and promote civil rights,&#x201D; Goodie
said.</p>
<p>The chapter is working to organize a cultural conference in
partnership with CSUMB&#x2019;s Asian-Pacific Islander Association and the
Associated Students&#x2019; Cultural Enrichment Committee.</p>
<p>According to Goodie, the purpose is to bring students together
to engage in dialogue about race, racism, classism and
solidarity.</p>
<p>They are also working on an event to commemorate World AIDS Day,
planning another voter registration drive and an NAACP membership
drive.</p>
<p>Said Goodie: &#x201C;I want people to know that the NAACP is diligently
working to uphold and embody CSUMB&#x2019;s vision and diversity
statements. . . . We are in another civil rights movement with all
these social issues going on and the NAACP&#x2019;s job is to make sure
people know,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our job on campus is to protect students&#x2019; rights and speak out
when we see injustices. We will continue to do that as we continue
to grow.&#x201D;<br>
