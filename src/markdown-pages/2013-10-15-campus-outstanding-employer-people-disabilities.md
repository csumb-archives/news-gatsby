<p>CSU Monterey Bay began with infrastructure built for able-bodied
military members. Those facilities were in place decades before the
Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s challenge to provide access &#x2013; physical,
programmatic, intellectual &#x2013; far exceeds that of other employers in
the area.</p>
<p><img alt="Disability Employment Awareness" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ada_story_image_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:507px">Because it has done
such a good job meeting that challenge, and because of its
inclusive philosophy and culture, CSUMB has been recognized by the
Monterey County Committee for the Employment of People with
Disabilities as an outstanding employer.</img></p>
<p>The university, and five other local employers, will be honored
at a luncheon Oct. 24 in Monterey. The luncheon will also call
attention to the fact that October is National Disability
Employment Awareness Month.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s Human Resources Department completed the application on
behalf of the university.</p>
<p>It noted that &#x201C;diversity inclusion and innovation as
cornerstones of our core values set a priority on physical and
intellectual access for more than 800 staff and faculty members
with diverse ranges of abilities and disabilities, and cultural
sub-texts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the last fiscal year, dozens of job accommodations were
provided by Human Resources in coordination with campus Facilities,
Technology Support Services and the campus Center for Academic
Technologies (assistive technology for staff, faculty and
students). Campus Planning and Development provided numerous
ergonomic evaluations and also showcases an ergonomics lab for
employees to explore adaptive equipment.</p>
<p>The Student Disability Resources office plays a part as well.
Though SDR&apos;s focus is on students, through advocacy, innovation,
and technical excellence, the office continues to spearhead ADA
access across the larger CSUMB community.</p>
<p>Universal design principles are the hallmark of structural
alterations and new construction on campus. Physical access from
car or public transit into buildings, offices and classrooms is a
focus. Significant resources have been directed to the construction
of accessible curb cuts, ramps and pathways of travel.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSUMB prides itself on employing qualified faculty and staff of
diverse abilities and disabilities,&#x201D; the application concluded. &#x201C;It
is our philosophy and a well-integrated culture of embracing
diversity that distinguishes California State University, Monterey
Bay as an outstanding employer of people with disabilities.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The other local employers being honored are Nob Hill Foods,
Lewis Builders, Home Town Buffet restaurants, Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute and PRIDE Industries.</p>
