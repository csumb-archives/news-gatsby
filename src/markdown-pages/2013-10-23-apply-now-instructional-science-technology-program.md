<p>The event will be held from 4:30 to 6 p.m. in the Alumni and

experience and how they are applying the skills they acquired to
their current work.</img></p>
<p>The 16-month program will start in the fall of 2014. Application

<p>The Master&#x2019;s in Instructional Science and Technology program
prepares students for positions in the fast-changing fields of
modern education and training. The hybrid learning experience &#x2013;
which integrates several days on campus at the beginning of each
semester with online classes &#x2013; enables graduates to advance in
their current careers and will position them to assume leadership
roles in education and training.</p>
<p>Successful educators and e-learning developers in the
knowledge-based, global economy require command of all the
technological tools and methodologies available to them; the MIST
program is designed to provide students with those skills.</p>
