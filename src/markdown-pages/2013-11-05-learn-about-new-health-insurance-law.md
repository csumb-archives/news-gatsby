<p>The first TV commercial rolled out in early September by Covered
California, the state&apos;s new health-insurance exchange, seemed to be
aimed at young people.</p>
<p><img alt="Health care reform is coming Jan. 1, 2014" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/healthcare_reform_arrows.jpg" style="float:left; width:259px; height:194px">The advertisement
uses a freeway-sign image to send a message to the age group most
likely to consider health insurance an unnecessary expense.</img></p>
<p>&quot;To those who&apos;ve waited, worried, hoped and tried, taken risks
and lived in a state of &apos;What if,&apos; welcome to a new state of
health. Welcome to Covered California,&quot; says the ad.</p>
<p>About 31 percent of all 18- to 34-year-olds in California are
uninsured. But the challenge among state officials has been
spreading the word about the federal health law and how the
state-run insurance market applies to young adults.</p>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, the <a href="http://iccs.csumb.edu/" rel="nofollow">Institute for Community Collaborative Studies</a> (ICCS)
is working to address that problem by offering outreach and
education to the campus and the larger community in advance of the
March 31, 2014, deadline for people to sign up. (Coverage starts
Jan. 1 if people enroll before Dec. 15, 2013.)</p>
<p>ICCS is sending certified Covered California educators into
classrooms to present information,&#xA0;answer questions and
distribute printed material. Those educators will also staff tables
at campus events over the next several months where students and
community members will have the opportunity to ask questions, have
coverage options explained and get estimates of premiums. The
public is invited to take advantage of this service.</p>
<p class="pullquote">DID YOU KNOW?<br>
In 2010, California was the first state in the nation to enact
legislation to implement the provisions of the federal Affordable
Care Act by creating a health care marketplace &#x2013; Covered
California.</br></p>
<p>The final event will be held from 9 a.m. to noon on Nov. 14 in
the&#xA0;University Center as part of the annual counselor
conference.</p>
