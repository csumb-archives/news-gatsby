entertaining presentation, Dr. Baldwin (pictured at right)
incorporates traditional native storytelling and original songs to
offer a rare glimpse into contemporary Native identity. Growing up
on several Indian reservations &#x2013; not his own &#x2013; Baldwin offers a
humorous look at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the small
government-funded communities that served the tribes during the
1960s.</img></br></br></p>
<p>His social commentary spans 55 years of federal policy and the
cultural change that such polices fostered on our country&#x2019;s Indian
reservations.<br>
<br>
Dr. Baldwin is a recognized member of the Osage and Kansa tribes of
Oklahoma. He has worked for dozens of Native tribes as a social
activist, promoting self-determination through tribal
reorganization, integration of new technologies, and education. He
is a founding faculty member at CSUMB and a professor in the
Social, Behavioral, and Global Studies Division.</br></br></p>

<p><em>Our Native culture is like a delicate weaving, with each
strand representing a part of our world. The flute is just one of
those strands. If you cut just one strand, over time you will lose
the entire weaving, so I strive to keep this part of our Native
culture alive, evolving, and intact. I wish to share it with the
world.&#xA0;</em><br>
