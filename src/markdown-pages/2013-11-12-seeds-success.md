Monterey Bay student&#x2019;s capstone project is completed, local
residents will be able to grow their own food, with help from an
unlikely source.</img></p>
<p>Heather Cunningham is working to set up a seed library at the
Monterey Public Library as part of the graduation requirements for
her degree in <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/es/" rel="nofollow">Environmental Studies.</a></p>
<p>Cunningham points out that the idea is taking root across the
country, with about 30 in operation, mostly in public libraries in
California.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: patrons &#x201C;check out&#x201D; seeds, take them home
to grow nutritious food for their families, harvest new seeds and
return them so the library can lend them out to others.</p>

movement is an excellent opportunity for grassroots action to
reduce use of non-renewable resources associated with food items,
Cunningham said. &#x201C;A seed library can contribute to the celebration
of local plant biodiversity, local wholesome produce and a culture
of sharing while fostering community resilience and self-reliance,&quot;
she said.</img></p>
<p>She organized two planning meetings in October, and will present
an official proposal to the Monterey Public Library director if
there is enough community interest.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think by the annual Cutting Day on March 16, a seed exchange
will be available for public use in the library,&#x201D; Cunningham said
with confidence. She added that nothing is official until a
proposal is approved by Kim Burton, director of the Monterey Public
Library.</p>
<p>Her plan calls for the initial seed inventory to be provided by
local individuals, organizations &#x2013; including CSUMB&#x2019;s Return of the
Natives restoration program &#x2013; and perhaps local seed companies and
farms.</p>
<p>So far, the planning has focused on seeds that produce
vegetables, but native plants may be included. Donors will be asked
to identify the location where the seeds were grown and the type of
plant. They will be invited to include growing notes and a picture
of the plant. The seeds will be put into small envelopes that will
be organized and displayed in shoe boxes, dresser drawers or other
pieces of repurposed furniture such as old library card
catalogs</p>
<p>Why does the project appeal to her? Among other reasons she
cited was her desire to prepare for new jobs that will require
environmentally friendly practices and enhance the natural
resources she values.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to learn how to effectively work with a community to get
projects off the ground and happening,&quot; she said. &quot;This project is
a perfect opportunity to experience that process.&quot;</p>
