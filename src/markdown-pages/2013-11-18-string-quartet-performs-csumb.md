concert set for Dec. 6</img></h3>
<p>The community is invited to a free concert of chamber music at
CSU Monterey Bay on Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Since forming the Friction Quartet while they were students at
the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Doug Machiz, Kevin Rogers,
Otis Harriel and Pei-Ling Lin have established a reputation for
edgy programming and exhilarating performance of contemporary
works.</p>
<p>Recent performances include La Belle Vie Concert Series at the
Legion of Honor, San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music&#x2019;s Chamber
Music Day, and Garrett-Moulton Productions&#x2019; A Show of Hands for
quartet and dancers.</p>

quartet will premiere a piece composed by Dr. Lanier Sammons, a
lecturer in the university&#x2019;s <a href="http://mpa.csumb.edu/" rel="nofollow">Music and Performing Arts Department.</a></img></p>
<p>The performance will start at 8 p.m. in the Music Hall, located
on Sixth Avenue between Col. Durham and Butler streets. Parking is
available in front of the building.</p>
<p>While the concert is free, visitors must purchase a parking
permit from a machine on the adjacent lot or by going <a href="https://store.csumb.edu/products/daily-parking-permit" rel="nofollow">online</a>. Driving directions and a campus map are
available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the group will work with student composers,
offering feedback on their compositions.</p>

<p>&#x201C;To watch the Friction Quartet is to see the utter embodiment of
the music. They are so fully there &#x2013; connected &#x2013; exchanging glances
as their bodies move, dip, sway, as if they are not four different
people.&#x201D;<br>
