are made by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and
Publishers to honor the past catalog and recent performances of
member composers. With the cash award, ASCAP supports the careers
and fosters the continuing development of American composers in
various genres.</img></br></br></p>
<p>Dr. Sammons, a composer and guitarist, teaches analog mixing and
digital editing as well as the MPA capstone class and master
classes.<br>
<br>
His music explores audience interactivity, improvisation, the
intersection of popular and classical music, and the pairing of
electronic and acoustic sound. As a performer, he explores multiple
genres on electric guitar, classical guitar and other
instruments.<br>
<br>
Dr. Sammons has also been selected to contribute a piece to the
Cellotronic Games, a competition that features pieces for cello and
electronics that offer a commentary on our game-involved
culture.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The proposal I sent them involves using Google image searches to
pull up images of graphic scores &#x2013; notation based on symbols other
than standard notation,&#x201D; Dr. Sammons explained.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The two performers take turns improvising in response to the image
that gets pulled up, and the audience votes on their preference to
award one of the performers a point. . . .&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Sammons is in his second year at CSUMB. He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s
degree from Columbia University and a master&#x2019;s and Ph.D. from the
University of Virginia.<br>
<br>
His research interests include composition and audience-interactive
music, the relationship between play and composition, new music for
the guitar, and the intersection and overlap between &quot;popular&quot;
music and &quot;art&quot; music.&#x2028;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
