<h3>CSUMB lecturer helps answer that question</h3>
<p><em>What will the future look like?&#xA0;It&apos;s a question that
writers, philosophers and scientists have been pondering for
millennia. But the future that once existed solely in the human
imagination . . . has arrived.</em><br>
<br>
That&apos;s the introduction to FutureScape, a six-part television
series hosted by actor James Woods. The series will premiere at 10
p.m., Nov. 19, on the Science Channel. A new episode will be shown
each week.</br></br></p>

lecturer in Humanities and Communication, appears in all six
episodes &#x2013; her &#x201C;15 minutes of fame,&#x201D; she says &#x2013; as a bioethicist,
lawyer and futurist.</img></p>
<p>The first episode deals with the robot revolution. Episode two
addresses advances in medical technology that will make old age
little more than a manageable chronic condition. Episode three
looks at the ability to create life from scratch. In episode four,
viewers will learn about galactic pioneers and how recent advances
in propulsion technology, warp drive, and solar energy have allowed
us to do what only science fiction writers dreamed possible. In
episode five, viewers learn about advances in genetic engineering
and neuroscience. The series concludes with a look at how
scientists are reading minds and scanning hidden memories and the
privacy implications.<br>
<br>
Glenn came to the attention of the show&#x2019;s production company
through some of her publications on the ethical, legal and social
implications of emerging technologies. Her articles address
human-machine mergers; how converging technologies will impact our
dinner tables; and ethical issues in genetic engineering, among
other topics.</br></br></p>
<p>Recommendations from L.A.-based media who heard her speak at
Singularity University in Silicon Valley also helped.</p>
<p class="pullquote">The Science Channel can be found on channel 52
on the campus cable system and on Comcast channel 272.</p>
<p>Last December, the Discovery Channel flew her from her home on
the East Coast to Hollywood for an interview. They liked what they
heard, and she was offered the opportunity to appear in the
series.<br>
<br>
A few months later, she and her husband relocated to California and
she landed the lecturer position at CSUMB. This semester, she&#x2019;s
teaching HCom 358, Critical Perspectives in Law and Society.<br>
<br>
The Science Channel gig isn&#x2019;t her first experience with network
television. In 2011, she was interviewed on the ethical and legal
issues around genetic engineering for a program on the History
Channel.<br>
<br>
Ms. Glenn is an attorney, bioethicist, educator and consultant. She
holds an appointment at the Alden March Bioethics Institute at
Albany Medical Center, is a Fellow at the Institute for Emerging
Technologies and a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation.<br>
<br>
She was the lead attorney in several cutting edge bioethics legal
cases, including the case of Gray vs. Romeo. She currently serves
as an adviser to several Silicon Valley biotech startups. She is
currently working on a book titled &#x201C;Bioethics for a New Earth: How
Emerging Technologies Can Save Humanity and Our Planet.&#x201D;<br>
