Professor Johanna Poethig&#x2019;s painting and mural class at Cal State
Monterey Bay are helping to brighten a park and learning valuable
lessons in the process.</img></p>
<p>They are creating a series of murals that will cover a 300-foot
wall at the new Pajaro Neighborhood Park &#x2013; a 4.9-acre parcel in the
largely farm worker community that straddles Monterey and Santa
Cruz counties.</p>
<p>CSUMB students are creating nine of the 14 murals; local artist
and muralist Jose Ortiz is working on the other five. Children from
local schools are also contributing their talents to the
effort.</p>
<p>The youngsters&#x2019; paintings are given an artistic touch by the
university&#x2019;s art students, and then the images are incorporated
into panels that are placed on the walls.</p>
<p>According to Professor Poethig, the project will take two or
three semesters.</p>
<p>Students in CSUMB&#x2019;s <a href="http://vpa.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Visual and Public Art Department</a> see the project as
a chance to hone their skills.</p>

page, the students say the wall is &#x201C;a great opportunity for public
art design, large-scale painting, student learning and professional
development, community improvisation, social practice and shared
space.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>The park will include a soccer field; gazebo; bandstand;
basketball court; an asphalt running/walking track; children&#x2019;s play
areas; picnic areas and a parking lot.</p>
<p>The Arts Council for Monterey County is sponsoring the
project.</p>
