<h3>This semester&apos;s festival set for Dec. 19 and 20</h3>
<p>Alyssa Huerta had some valuable insights while creating a
portfolio of work around the theme of &#x201C;youth and future.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To fulfill a CSU Monterey Bay requirement that all seniors
complete a capstone &#x2013; a creative or research project &#x2013; the Human
Communication major, who presented her capstone last year, wrote
three poems and five short stories.</p>
<p><img alt="A capstone project is required to graduate from CSUMB" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/seniorcapstone.jpg" style="float:left; width:250px; height:114px">&quot;My poems and
stories are about what shaped my life,&#x201D; said Huerta, of
Watsonville. &#x201C;They show the progression of my life from adolescence
to adulthood; from an age of innocence to a more troubled
world.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Writing them required her to reflect on her family, her community,
and her generation &#x2013; the Millennials &#x2013; in a deeper and more
meaningful way than she had before registering for the capstone
class.<br>
<br>
Her project fulfilled a requirement facing graduating seniors at
colleges and universities across the country. By requiring a
capstone project, the schools want undergraduates to pull together,
synthesize and apply years of learning.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
At CSUMB, all students have been required to do capstone projects
since the first graduating class in 1997. Some of those projects
are archived in the campus library. (View the archive <a href="http://capstone.csumb.edu/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;During the Capstone Festival held at the end of each semester,
the campus takes on the feel of an intellectual marketplace. At
recent festivals, a biology major presented a study of human stem
cell proliferation, a social and behavioral sciences major looked
at women police officers in American society and a psychology
student examined the socialization of sarcasm.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Business students, working in teams, presented strategic business
plans for local companies and organizations.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
A World Languages and Cultures student gave a 25-minute talk &#x2013;
entirely in Japanese &#x2013; on the arguments for and against changing
Article 9 of the Japanese constitution. A PowerPoint presentation
running in the background provided the information in
English.<br>
<br>
And a music major &#x2013; with help from his friends &#x2013; performed a
three-movement piece he composed for a brass quartet.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
While the projects require a great deal of time and effort, they&#x2019;re
worth it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>&quot;Increasingly, people want to know what students can do with
their learning and how they can apply that learning across all the
courses in their college,&quot; Carol Grear Schneider, president of the
Association of American Colleges and Universities, told the Los
Angeles Times.<br>
<br>
In addition, she told The Times, colleges want to do a better job
of preparing graduates for the demands of the job market and
graduate schools. The capstones, she said, help students &quot;become
people who can problem-solve and produce something of high
quality.&quot;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Research by the National Survey of Student Engagement shows a
steady increase in those completing capstones. In 2009, 64 percent
of students reported doing such a project compared to nine percent
in 2000.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;Campus-wide requirements like the one at CSUMB are most common at
small liberal arts colleges. At nearly 40 percent of universities,
some individual departments require them. Examples include UCLA,
the University of Utah and Keene State College in New Hampshire.
And many schools offer them as options rather than
requirements.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
