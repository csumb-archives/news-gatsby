<p>The CSUMB capstones are like a two-day schoolwide talent
show.<br>
It all comes down to this. At the end of each semester, senior
students from every department at CSU Monterey Bay present their
capstones &#x2013; the culminating projects of their years of schooling &#x2013;
at various locations.<br>
