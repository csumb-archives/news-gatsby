<p>Cal State Monterey Bay archeology professor Ruben Mendoza teamed
with two students to land a National Endowment for the Humanities
grant to teach educators from around the country about the history
of California&apos;s missions.</p>
<p>Jewel-Sean Gentry and Jennifer Lucido helped Dr. Mendoza write
the successful grant request for $177,000 to fund two workshops
that will bring teachers to the Central Coast next summer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This was an amazing opportunity for us as students,&#x201D; said
Gentry, a Riverside native who is the president of the university&#x2019;s
Archaeology Club. &#x201C;We worked a lot of long nights on this over the
winter break.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lucido, a Seaside native who graduated from CSUMB and now
attends graduate school at Sonoma State, said, &#x201C;As a student,
particularly as an undergraduate, the opportunity to write and to
assist in the organization of a grant is highly applicable to my
field of study. That in itself was a fantastic learning
experience.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;However, to actually be awarded the grant is phenomenal. It not
only adds to my professional experience and my credibility, but is
an opportunity to promote the history of California at a
significantly broader level.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Gentry, a returning student who had worked as a director in a
vocational school in San Diego before enrolling at CSUMB to pursue
an interest in archaeology, said the organizational skills he
learned on the job served him well in helping bring the grant
proposal together.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I think returning students are a great resource for the
university. They bring different skill sets and experiences,&#x201D; said
Gentry, who said his decision to return to college was about
&#x201C;rebooting myself.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Mendoza, a founding faculty member at CSUMB, said the grant
application was a team effort. He said Lucido and Gentry were very
much co-authors of the grant as they helped bring together the many
details of the proposal.<br>
<br>
The grant, through the NEH&#x2019;s &quot;Landmarks of American History and
Culture&quot; program, was one of only three awarded in California and
22 awarded nationwide.<br>

(pictured at right) said the grant program was so competitive that
he was worried all the work that the students had put in might end
in disappointment. &#x201C;When Sen. Boxer&#x2019;s office called (to notify them
of the grant approval), I couldn&#x2019;t believe it. The fact that they
were undergraduates who had played such an important role made it
that much more exciting.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The workshop is entitled &quot;The Fourteenth Colony: Native
Californians, Missions, Presidios and Colonists on the Spanish
Frontier, 1769-1848.&quot; Two separate week-long sessions, each serving
40 teachers, will be held at the Asilomar Conference Grounds next
summer. Participants will visit Central Coast mission sites and the
sessions will feature some of the most prominent Native California
and California mission studies scholars in the country.</br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>As word of the program has spread, Dr. Mendoza has received
inquiries from teachers around the country who are interested in
participating.<br>
<br>
The goal is to help the teachers incorporate the missions&#x2019; history
into the lessons they teach their students. A supplemental grant
awarded to Dr. Mendoza will make that easier. The extra money will
be used to develop a website that will provide electronic resources
for teachers. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://mrc.the14thcolony.org/" rel="nofollow">Visit the website

Meanwhile, Gentry and Lucido are continuing their academic
collaboration. They attended the recent American Anthropological
Association meeting in San Francisco and presented their first
conference paper together, &#x201C;Children of St. Francis: New
Perspectives In California Mission Studies.&#x201D;<br>
