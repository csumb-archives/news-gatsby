<p><img alt="Open University logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/openu-logo.jpg" style="float:left; width:258px; height:114px">Maybe you&#x2019;re
interested in pursuing your bachelor&apos;s degree, preparing for a
promotion at work or just want one class while you take some time
off from an out-of-town university.</img></p>
<p>Or maybe you want to learn about rock and roll cinema, or how to
create 3D characters for video games.<br>
<br>
There&#x2019;s an opportunity to do all of those at Cal State Monterey
Bay.</br></br></p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s Open University allows people who are not current
students of CSUMB to enroll in academic courses on a
space-available basis and earn college credit without being
admitted. In the fall 2013 semester, more than 2,000 seats were
available in classes across the entire CSUMB campus.<br>
<br>
The tuition for Open University at CSUMB is $245 per unit. Students
can take this lower cost approach to part time classes for up to 24
units before they are required to apply as a &quot;regular&quot; student at
CSUMB.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s also a way for students to earn upper division credits while
waiting for admission to CSUMB or combine CSUMB classes while
earning lower division credits at Hartnell, Monterey Peninsula,
Cabrillo or other community college.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>These classes also allow employees to grow professionally,
prepare for a promotion or career change.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;People exploring new careers can benefit because, as upper
division classes, they are extremely focused,&#x201D; said Jill Hosmer
Jolley of CSUMB&#x2019;s Office of Extended Education.</br></br></p>
<p>Or, people can take a class such as Rock n Roll Cinema &#x2013; the
most popular class in CSUMB&#x2019;s Cinematic Arts Department &#x2013; just for
the fun of it. Where else can you see Spinal Tap, the Rolling
Stones, Pink Floyd, Elvis Presley, La Bamba and the Beatles on film
and meet other rock music lovers?<br>
<br>
Registration takes place on the first day of class. The spring
semester starts Jan. 21.<br>
