<h3>Biggest enrollment ever expected&#xA0;</h3>
<p>Students who want to attend California State University,
Monterey Bay in fall 2014 have some tough competition.<br>

straight year, CSUMB received a record number of freshmen
applications.<br>
Freshmen hoping to enroll in fall 2014 submitted more than 14,800
applications, 6.4 percent more than last year.</br></img></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;We will accept about 45 percent of those students,&#x201D; said Dr.
Ronnie Higgs, vice president of student affairs and enrollment
services.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSUMB has become a first-choice university for many of these
applicants. The demand is growing,&#x201D; Dr. Higgs said.</p>
<p>Among transfer students, CSUMB received more than 3,700
applications, an increase of 34 percent over the last two years.
About 60 percent of those students will be accepted.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We expect to have another record enrollment for fall 2014, the
fifth straight year that the previous enrollment record will be
broken,&#x201D; Dr. Higgs said.</p>
<p>While he was pleased with the number of applicants, his
enthusiasm was tempered by the prospect of the university having to
turn away so many.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Limiting the number of students accepted for admissions has a
lot to do with maintaining the academic quality, class space
limitations, housing and other factors,&#x201D; Dr. Higgs said. &#x201C;As we
continue our enrollment growth, these areas will continue to
receive the utmost attention.&#x201D;</p>
