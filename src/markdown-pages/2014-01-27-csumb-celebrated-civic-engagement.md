<h3>Service learning highlighted at national conference</h3>
<p>In 2013, CSU Monterey Bay was selected as one of five colleges
and universities to receive the Higher Education Civic Engagement
Award presented by The Washington Center for Internships and
Academic Seminars and the New York Life Foundation.<br>
<br>
The university&#x2019;s work in student and community engagement was
promoted again at the Association of American Colleges &amp;
Universities&#x2019; 2014 annual conference held Jan. 22-25 in Washington,
D.C.<br>
<br>
Dr. Seth Pollack, director of service learning, represented the
university at a panel on &#x201C;Building Partnerships for Change.&#x201D; He
shared CSUMB&#x2019;s accomplishments and advice for others around the
country seeing to make similar change.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;The Washington Center established the Higher Education Civic
Engagement Award to recognize schools that are reaching beyond
their own campuses to achieve sustainable civic impacts,&#x201D; said Mike
Smith, president of The Washington Center.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We congratulate Cal State Monterey Bay and we are pleased to be
able to bring their excellent work to the attention of the members
of AAC&amp;U. CSUMB is an innovator and leader in forging
partnerships to address issues of public concern and their work
should be promoted as a best practice in higher education.&#x201D;</p>
