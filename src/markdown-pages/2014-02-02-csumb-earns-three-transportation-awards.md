<h3>Bike Bunker project, two students honored</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s work to promote alternative transportation
has garnered three excellence awards from the Transportation Agency
for Monterey County. The awards were among 10 presented at TAMC&apos;s
board meeting on Jan. 22; they recognize individuals, groups and
businesses for efforts to improve the way people get around in
Monterey County.</p>
<p>The university&#x2019;s <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/bike-bunker" rel="nofollow">Bike
Bunker</a>, which opened last year, was honored in the projects
category. It provides secure, convenient indoor storage for 36
bicycles. All spaces are currently rented.</p>

transportation planner Megan Tolbert led the project team, which
included students and staff members from across campus. Otto
Construction and Telemetrix did the construction and electrical
work and donated 10 percent of their time.</img></p>
<p>The design was based on a similar facility at Portland State
University.</p>
<p>The project was paid for by a grant from the Monterey Bay
Unified Air Pollution Control District.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Students Richard Vasquez and Casey Andrews were honored in the
individual category.</p>
<p>Vasquez has since graduated and works in web and graphic design
for Cisco. For his senior capstone project, he created an identity
package, marketing materials and fa&#xE7;ade treatments for the Bike
Bunker. His work helped to create a bike culture and increase
ridership at CSUMB and contributed to the success of the
bunker.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Richard&#x2019;s work helped us stretch our dollars in a way that made it
aesthetically pleasing,&#x201D; Tolbert said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve used Richard&#x2019;s
bicycle icon around campus.&#x201D;<br>

<img alt="Casey Andrews" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/casey_for_web_0.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height:691px">Andrews worked on
<a href="http://transportation.csumb.edu/tripwise-home" rel="nofollow">TRIPwise</a>, an identity for programs, infrastructure
and events that support a robust alternative transportation program
on campus. His Transit Tree poster and website updates have led to
an increase in transit ridership on campus &#x2013; up 300 percent since
his freshman year. A senior, he will graduate in May.</img></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Since 2010, the university has worked to provide transportation
options for members of the campus community. Options include free
rides on Monterey-Salinas Transit for anyone with an Otter ID card;
a campus cycle center where students can rent a bike or get their
bike repaired; a rideshare board; two electric vehicle charging
stations; and a transportation information center on campus.</p>
<p>Tolbert is currently working on a Transportation Demand
Management Plan for CSUMB, which has identified a need for r 500
more indoor bike parking spaces.<br>
<br>
It&#x2019;s the second time Tolbert has been honored by TAMC. In 2010, she
won an award in the individual category for her work on bicycle and
mass transit prior to joining the university&apos;s staff, and for her
achievements during her first year on campus.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Ms. Tolbert has been a strong advocate for alternative
transportation in Monterey County. Not only has she been an asset
to TAMC as a transportation planner with CSUMB, but her work with
Monterey Green Action has been key to promoting the use of bicycles
as a viable transportation alternative . . . and her key role in
educating the public on rail transit,&#x201D; the agency&#x2019;s website
says.</p>
