Ms. Holmsky will be responsible for establishing the Cradle to
Career Partnership as a catalyst for regional partners to work
together, across sectors, and along the social and educational
continuum to drive better results in education, for every child
from cradle to career.</img></p>
<p>The director will provide leadership and facilitate the
achievement of the coalition&#x2019;s goals to ensure that every child is
prepared for school, supported inside and outside of school,
succeeds in school, enrolls in some form of postsecondary
education, graduates, and enters a career.</p>
<p>The Monterey County Cradle to Career partnership will be based
on a model adopted by more than 100 communities across the country
that share best practices through the <a href="http://www.strivetogether.org/cradle-career-network" rel="nofollow">Cradle to Career Network</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The network&#x2019;s motto is &#x201C;Every Child. Cradle to Career.&#x201D; Cradle
to Career Network communities promote a broad commitment among
social service, education, business and philanthropic agencies to
work together to achieve agreed-upon goals for student success.</p>
<p>Since the first Cradle to Career partnership began in Cincinnati
and Northern Kentucky in 2006, communities in 37 states and the
District of Columbia have established programs.</p>
<p>A Monterey resident, Ms. Holmsky has a background in non-profit
and business organizations, including those devoted to student
learning and career readiness. She comes to the university from a
position as vice president for talent and organization development
at Pacific Metrics Corp. in Monterey. Prior to that position, she
was vice president for human resources at Shop.com and a consultant
and general manager for the Big Sur Land Trust.</p>
<p>In volunteer capacities, she has served as board president of
Camp SEA Lab, a program that helps youngsters discover the ocean
through summer camps and outdoor school programs; has been a board
member of the YMCA of the Monterey Peninsula; and an adviser and
grant writer for a local independent high school.</p>
<p>She earned a master&#x2019;s degree in human resource and organization
development from the University of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Ms. Holmsky will assume the position on Feb. 17.</p>
