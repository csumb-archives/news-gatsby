<h3>Opportunity for participants to create the next killer app</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s innovative, intense and for those who thrive on creative
competition, a shot at fame and fortune.<br>
<br>
<img alt="&apos;The Ideas of March&apos; will be held at CSUMB March 14-16" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ideas_of_march.jpg" style="width:225px; height:242px; float:left">It&#x2019;s the &#x201C;Ideas of
March,&#x201D; a three-day Android development competition open to college
students with basic programming skills who are interested in
producing mobile apps.<br>
<br>
Small businesses, non-profits and government agencies are
encouraged to submit ideas for apps that would benefit their
organizations.<br>
<br>
The event, which kicks off on March 14, is sponsored by the
Institute for Innovation and Economic Development at CSU Monterey
Bay, the university&#x2019;s Computer Science and Information Technology
program and the Monterey County Business Council.<br>
<br>
Teams will build their applications throughout the weekend, and
then present their work &#x2013; real, working prototype apps &#x2013; on the
evening of March16, with winners chosen in several
categories.<br>
<br>
Last year&#x2019;s overall winner was an app created for Cedar Street
Times, a weekly newspaper in Pacific Grove. The app allows the
paper to share its news from its own website and also provides an
avenue for community members to post news and events.<br>
<br>
There is no cost to participate, but prospective participants must
apply by Feb. 21. Food and beverages will be provided during event
hours.<br>
<br>
The event will be held in the Media Learning Center (Bldg. 18) on
the CSUMB campus. <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">Driving directions and a campus map.</a><br>
