Bonnie Irwin, dean of the College of Arts and Humanities and
professor of English at Eastern Illinois University, has been named
provost and vice president for academic affairs at CSU Monterey
Bay. Her appointment follows a national search.</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Both the search committee and the campus community were
impressed by Dr. Irwin&#x2019;s experience, vision and leadership
qualities,&#x201D; said CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We were pleased by the strong field of candidates that
responded to the job announcement, but, even in that group, Dr.
Irwin&#x2019;s credentials set her apart. All of us here at Cal State
Monterey Bay look forward to working with her as we continue to
advance the academic excellence of our campus.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As vice president for academic affairs, she will oversee all
academic colleges and programs, and she will work with the other
members of the university&#x2019;s senior leadership team and the
president to improve university-wide effectiveness and success. As
provost, she will act as president in the absence of the
president.</p>
<p>Dr. Irwin started her teaching career as a graduate student
instructor at the University of California at Berkeley, and has
been on the faculty at Eastern Illinois since 1994. Her time there
included stints as English undergraduate studies and honors
coordinator and dean of the Honors College.</p>
<p>In her administrative work, Dr. Irwin has facilitated
initiatives in integrative learning, undergraduate research,
interdisciplinary studies and inclusive excellence. She is a former
president of the National Collegiate Honors Council and currently
serves on the board of the American Conference of Academic
Deans.</p>
<p>A former resident of California, she earned her bachelor&#x2019;s,
master&#x2019;s and doctorate in comparative literature from UC
Berkeley.</p>
<p>She will assume her duties on July 7. She succeeds Dr. Julio
Blanco, who has filled the position on an interim basis since
May.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am thrilled to be joining the CSUMB community,&#x201D; Dr. Irwin
said. &#x201C;During my recent visit, I was impressed by the dedication,
idealism, and talents of the faculty and staff, who are clearly
invested in the success of the students and the wellbeing of the
entire region.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I look forward to being part of the CSUMB team for the journey
ahead as we grow and flourish as a great institution of higher
learning.&#x201D;</p>
