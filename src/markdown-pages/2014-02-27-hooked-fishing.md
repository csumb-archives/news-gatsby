<h3>CSUMB anglers place third in Western Invitational</h3>
<p>Competitive bass fishing at the collegiate level &#x2013; who knew?</p>
<p>In 2008, FLW, the organizer of professional fishing tournaments,
started a college tour. Now, more than 600 teams compete in five
divisions, according to FLW&#x2019;s website, and it just keeps growing.
It&#x2019;s even on television &#x2013; NBC Sports has broadcast tournaments.</p>
<p><img alt="Josh Smith and Andrew Sjostrom took third place at Clear Lake" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/second_one_for_web_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:375px; height:220px">Two teams from CSU
Monterey Bay&apos;s Bass Fishing Club &#x2013; Andrew Sjostrom and Joshua
Smith, and Matthew Diaz and Sebastian Resendiz &#x2013; competed in the
Western Conference Invitational tournament Oct. 12 and 13 in Clear
Lake. They were among 45 teams that competed for a top prize of
$4,000 for their club and their school and a berth in next year&#x2019;s
FLW national championship.</img></p>
<p>At the tournaments, the goal is simple: land 10 bass (five per
day) over the two-day tournament that weigh more than the other
teams.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Smith and Sjostrom took third place with a total of nine fish
weighing 37 lbs., 2 oz. That was worth a $1,000 prize and a spot in
next spring&apos;s national tournament.</p>
<p>Diaz and Resendiz teamed for eighth place with fishing weighing
31 lbs., 9 oz. They also qualified for the national event.</p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s club started several years ago. Members travel to
tournaments in California and other Western states. In 2011, Diaz
and David Hamblin won $2,000 with a fourth-place finish at Lake
Roosevelt in Hunters, Washington.</p>
<p>That involves more than just luck. Competitors do their homework
&#x2013; analyzing depth and currents, finding locals who can give them
&#x201C;inside&#x201D; information on the lake where the competition will be
held, visiting the site in advance to plan strategies.</p>
<p>The fishing club is just one of many opportunities for CSUMB
students to participate in outdoor recreation and intramural
sports.&#xA0;</p>
