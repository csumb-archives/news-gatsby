<p>Following on the heels of Eve Ensler&#x2019;s &#x201C;Vagina Monologues,&#x201D; CSU
Monterey Bay students continue their campaign to end sexual
violence against women with three performances of the &#x201C;The MENding
Monologues.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="The MENding Monologues will be performed at CSUMB March 13-15" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mending_4x5_2.jpg" style="width:250px; height:313px; float:left">Both a bookend and
male response to Ensler&#x2019;s play &#x2013; which has been produced at CSUMB
for 13 years &#x2013; Derek Dujardin&#x2019;s production borrows the monologue
format, featuring stories of how men are affected when violence is
waged against women.</img></p>
<p>Using first-person monologues, sketch comedy and poetry, men
take the audience on an emotional and educational roller-coaster
ride through relationships and gender issues to create a healing
experience.</p>
<p>This is the third year &#x201C;The MENding Monologues&#x201D; has been staged
at CSUMB. Performances will be held at 8 p.m. on March 13, 14 and
15 in the Black Box Cabaret, located at Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard
and Inter-Garrison Road, behind the Health and Wellness Center.</p>
<p>Tickets are $7 for CSUMB students and $10 for everyone else.
Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.eu/maps.

<p>&#x201C;The MENding Monologues&#x201D; is one of more than a dozen events at

<p>How pervasive is the issue of violence against women?</p>
<p>The National Institute of Justice found that about one in five
women and 6 percent of men are victims of sexual assault while in
college. According to data collected under the Jeanne Clery
Disclosure of Campus Crime Statistics Act in 2009, college campuses
reported nearly 3,300 forcible sex offenses. (Source: U.S.
