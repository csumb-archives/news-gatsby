National Education Association, Read Across America Day is held
every year near the March 2 birthday of famed children&#x2019;s author
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss.</img></p>
<p>Members of the women&#x2019;s golf and volleyball teams, men&#x2019;s cross
country and men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s soccer teams read Dr. Seuss books to
youngsters in kindergarten through third grade and shared their
experiences with reading.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels good to give back something to the community by
modeling a love for reading,&quot; said volleyball player Julia
Ashen.</p>
<p>&quot;Reading is one of the greatest gifts that we can share among
the generations, and seeing how much reading means to us can be a
powerful motivator.&quot;</p>
<p>Read Across America is an annual event meant to get children
excited about reading. It borrows from the world of sports with pep
rallies and other activities to make reading fun.</p>
<p>The fun wasn&#x2019;t limited to the youngsters.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is better than seeing the enjoyment on the kids faces
as we teach them the value of reading,&#x201D; said cross country runner
Eric Jackson.</p>
<p>Other athletes who participated: Ryan Torres, cross country;
Erin Falge, Megan Parayno and Shea Robinson, women&#x2019;s golf; Drew
Ramsey, Manuel Cazares and Marco Rangel, men&#x2019;s soccer; Skyler
Allen, Arianna Mariotti and Janai Johnson, volleyball.</p>
