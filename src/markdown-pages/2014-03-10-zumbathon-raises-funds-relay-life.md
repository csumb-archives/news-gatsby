<h3>CSUMB Rotaract Club organizes March 29 event</h3>
<p>The CSU Monterey Bay Rotaract Club will host a Zumbathon to
benefit the American Cancer Society&#x2019;s Relay for Life from 10 a.m.
to noon, Saturday, March 29 at Water City Skate in Marina.</p>

more than just a fundraiser. It&#x2019;s a time to &#x201C;celebrate, remember
and fight back&#x201D; against cancer. CSUMB Rotaract, a campus
organization dedicated to community service and affiliated with
Rotary International, is doing just that with this upbeat,
high-energy event.</img></p>
<p>According to club co-president Charn Singh, a junior biology
major, Rotaract brings together college students for the purpose of
humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting
peace around the world.<br>
<br>
Said Singh: &#x201C;One thing that makes our club unique is that we&#x2019;re not
university-based; instead, we&#x2019;re community-based. Students from
Monterey Peninsula College, Hartnell College, Monterey Institute of
International Studies and the Defense Language Institute can join,
and we have several members from each of those institutions.&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>Zumbathon participants are asked to make a $10 minimum donation.
All proceeds will go to the American Cancer Society. Raffles,
prizes and giveaways from local restaurants and businesses will be
part of the fun.</p>

a life-changing event that gives everyone a chance to celebrate the
lives of those who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost
and fight back against the disease.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Everyone knows someone touched by cancer, which in itself is
really scary. It&#x2019;s important for our community to come together and
help finish the fight against cancer,&#x201D; Singh said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sometimes, it&#x2019;s easy to feel small when you want to do
something major. As long as we have passionate individuals who want
to help in any way, then I know we can make a difference. It&#x2019;s all
about &#x2018;Service Above Self&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Participants should bring water, a towel and a smile to this
event. To find out more about the Zumbathon, contact Carina at
