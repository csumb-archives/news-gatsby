<p>A vital part of being an artist is entering works into juried
competitions. Students at CSU Monterey Bay had the opportunity to
do that, thanks to a generous donation from a faculty member.</p>
<p><img alt="A call for site-specific works has gone out" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/eye.jpeg" style="float:right; width:259px; height:194px">A call went out
for site-specific entries to be displayed in the Otter Express and
the University Center. Three works were selected for the E. Richard
Brown Award for Excellence in Art. The winning artists &#x2013; Jorge
Amezcua, Lori Van Meter and Victor Veltran &#x2013; received cash prizes
and stipends to pay for materials. Their work will be displayed for
a year.</img></p>
<p>The three pieces will be installed on April 18. A reception and
awards presentation is scheduled for 5 p.m., April 24, in the
Visual and Public Art Department, Building 72.</p>
<p>&#x201C;During my time here on campus, I haven&#x2019;t noticed much student
art displayed,&#x201D; said Dr. Brown, who teaches a First Year Seminar
and service learning classes. &#x201C;So I thought, what if I were to make
a monetary award to motivate the students to become more active in
art and all of us would have the benefit of seeing that
art?&quot;<img alt="E. Richard Brown award winners" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/art_winners_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:275px; height:207px"/></p>
<p>An experience he had while a student at UCLA motivated him to
support the awards.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I remembered how powerful it was when I was at UCLA and won the
Frank Sinatra Award for second-place pop vocalist,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;So I
contacted Lila Staples (chair of the Visual and Public Art
Department)&#x201D; to offer the donation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It has brought incredible joy to my heart. My hope is that
someone else will see what can be done and also give,&#x201D; Dr. Brown
said.</p>
