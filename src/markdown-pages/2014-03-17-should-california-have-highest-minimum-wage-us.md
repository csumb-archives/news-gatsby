<h3>Ethics panel examines the topic March 27</h3>
<p>Tens of thousands of California&#x2019;s hourly workers will become the
best paid in the country when a new minimum wage law goes into
effect.</p>
<p><img alt="The minimum wage is topic of March 27 ethics panel" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/money.jpeg" style="float:left; width:275px; height:183px">Last September, the
state Legislature voted to raise the minimum wage from $8 to $9 on
July 1, and to $10 on Jan. 1, 2016. Gov. Jerry Brown and state
lawmakers said the increase is needed to keep up with rising
costs.</img></p>
<p>According to a statement issued by Sen. Darrell Steinberg, more
than 90 percent of minimum-wage workers in the state are over the
age of 20, while nearly 2.4 million children live in a household
with a parent who earns the current minimum of $8 per hour. The pay
bump will boost a full-time worker&#x2019;s income by about $4,000, to
around $20,000 a year.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s the background for the topic to be discussed at CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s 12th annual Ethics Forum &#x2013; Should California have
the highest minimum wage in the U.S.?</p>
<p>The forum will be held from 3 to 5 p.m., March 27, in the
University Center on Sixth Avenue at B Street. The forum is free;
attendees will have to purchase a parking permit from a machine on
the parking lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available
here.</p>
<p>Jason Scorse, director of the Center for the Blue Economy and a
professor at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, will
be the keynote speaker. Panelists will include Jody Hansen,
president and CEO of the Monterey Peninsula Chamber of Commerce;
Cesar Lara, executive director of the Monterey Bay Central Labor
Council; and Sam Teel, board chairman of the Monterey County
Hospitality Association.</p>
<p>Among the questions they will discuss:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Will businesses flee California?<br>
&#x2022; Will low-wage employees flock to the state?<br>
&#x2022; Will the economy benefit as workers&#x2019; purchasing power
increases?<br>
&#x2022; How will the increase impact Monterey County&#x2019;s two biggest
industries &#x2013; agriculture and hospitality?</br></br></br></p>
