including the collection of essays, <em>Angeleno Days,</em> which
Richard Rodriguez has called &#x201C;delightful and wise.&#x201D;</img></p>

California Studies at Westmont College, where he teaches creative
nonfiction, the short story, the literature of California, and
Middle Eastern &#xE9;migr&#xE9; literature.</p>
