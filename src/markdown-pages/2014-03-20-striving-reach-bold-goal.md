managing director of Strive Together, will speak at CSU Monterey
Bay on April 9 as the President&#x2019;s Speaker Series concludes for the
year.</img></p>
<p>Strive Together is a national initiative that brings together
leaders from pre-kindergarten through higher education, business,
community organizations, government, parents and others who are
committed to helping children succeed from cradle to career.<br>
<br>
Edmondson served as executive director of The Strive Partnership in
Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky. He&#x2019;ll share lessons learned in
that partnership in his talk, &#x201C;Collective Impact: A New Way of
Doing Business to Improve Educational Outcomes.&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>Those lessons are currently being applied across the country.
The program identifies specific goals, comes up with a common way
to measure those goals, and does so by using a rigorous set of data
that can be shared with everyone. Each community sets its own
priorities for improving education for students &quot;from cradle to
career.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Cradle to Career Partnership has recently been established in
Monterey County.<br>
<br>
Edmondson&#x2019;s presentation will get under way at 3:30 p.m. in the
World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. Driving directions and
a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are
necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling
the World Theater box office at 582-4580, or by going <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/csumb.edu/forms/d/1W9UGd0GvMFTvlrzS5UdSHzPPEcUv3RhS7oK85vUf9No/viewform" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</p>
<p>The series, with the theme &#x201C;Flourish Monterey County,&#x201D; kicked
off on March 4 with a presentation by Mary Jo Waits, director of
the Economic, Human Services and Workforce Division of the National
Governors Association. Her topic: Leveraging Universities in
Regional Economic Development. On March 28, Dr. David Kennedy,
former director of the Boston Gun Project, will talk on Gangs, Guns
and Growth: Finding Alternatives to Violence.</p>
