teaching credential from CSU Monterey Bay and is currently enrolled
in the university&#x2019;s master of arts in education program, was given
the Crystal Apple Award by television station KSBW.<br>
<br>
Nine times each year, the station honors teachers from the
tri-county area for their &#x201C;dedication to stimulating minds and
improving students&apos; lives.&#x201D; News anchor Dan Green visits the
classrooms of the winners to make the presentation in person.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;She has just two years (of teaching) under her belt, but she has
been able to learn and apply the best techniques from the great
teachers around her,&#x201D; Green told the viewers. &#x201C;The kids have really
responded.&#x201D;<br>
