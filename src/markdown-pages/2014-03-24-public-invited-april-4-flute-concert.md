will present a program of works for flute at a free public
performance April 4 at CSU Monterey Bay.<br>
<br>
The 7 p.m. concert will be held in the Music Hall, located on Sixth
Avenue near Butler Street.<br>
<br>
The concert will feature pieces for flute alone and flute with
electronics. The work explores the intersections of text and
music.<br>
<br>
The program includes three new pieces written for Chambo by
emerging composers Lanier Sammons, a lecturer in CSUMB&#x2019;s Music and
Performing Arts Department; Sarah Summar; and L. Scott Price, all
based on Chambo&#x2019;s poetry. The composers were offered a selection of
poems, and invited to choose one and use it in some way to
construct a piece.<br>
<br>
The program includes existing contemporary pieces. In addition,
selections from Charles Koechlin&#x2019;s &#x201C;Les Chants de Nectaire,&#x201D; a
massive cycle for solo flute inspired by the writings of Anatole
France and Virgil, are interspersed throughout the program,
providing a connecting thread.<br>
<br>
In addition to her performing work, Chambo also has a background in
creative writing and has published poems in The Greensboro Review,
Artizen, and Cellar Door.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>

purchase a parking permit from a machine on the University Center
parking lot, located next to the Music Hall.<br>
