author of&#xA0;<em>Monstress</em>, which binds together eight tales
of isolated misfits in San Francisco and the Philippines. They have
been described as &#x201C;tender&#x201D; and &#x201C;quirky,&#x201D; written from the point of
view of charlatans, B movie starlets, superhero obsessives and
transgender cocktail waitresses.</img></p>
<p>NPR said of the stories: &#x201C;Filipino traditions meet Californian
modernity again and again, each encounter revealing something
unexpected about both cultures.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The roots of Tenorio&apos;s tales are buried in his family&apos;s decision
to immigrate to California when he was 7 months old. He grew up in
a home eager to assimilate.</p>
<p>His stories have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine and
<em>The Best New American Voices</em> and Pushcart Prize
anthologies. A Whiting Writer&apos;s Award winner and a former Stegner
Fellow at&#xA0;<img alt="Book cover of Monstress" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/book.png" style="width:296px; height:445px; float:right">Stanford

Communication; the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences;
Student Activities and Leadership Development; Asian Pacific
Islander Association; and the Office of Inclusive Excellence.</p>
<p><em>Tenorio&#x2026;has taken a uniquely Filipino-American perspective,
polyglot and glittering with cinema dreams, and used it to make a
bold collection of stories of the rejected, the helpless and the
lost. Monstress is the debut of a singular talent.</em><br>

<p><em>. . . refreshingly off-kilter&#x2026;his stories are impeccably
constructed, leading us calmly but insistently through the
characters&#x2019; external and internal landscapes.</em><br>
