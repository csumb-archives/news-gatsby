<h3>Lands summer internship with upscale car company</h3>
<p>It&#x2019;s hard to tell who is more excited about Brett Roberts&#x2019;
summer internship at Tesla &#x2013; Roberts or his professor, Jonathan
Shu.</p>
<p>Shu, who calls Tesla &#x201C;one of the hottest companies in Silicon
Valley,&#x201D; said he &#x201C;nagged&#x201D; his students to apply for summer jobs,
and specifically mentioned Tesla, the electric car company
headquartered in Palo Alto. (Manufacturing and production take
place at the former Nummi plant in Fremont.)</p>
<p><img alt="Brett Roberts" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/brett_roberts_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:300px">Roberts followed up
on the suggestion, in part because his best friend &#x201C;always talked
about how much he wanted to work at Tesla.&#x201D; An application to work
in the company&#x2019;s information technology division brought a call
from a recruiter and a conversation that covered the basics. A
second call followed, from the person to whom he would be
reporting.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The second call was a technical interview specifically for the
IT Applications intern position,&#x201D; Roberts said. &#x201C;The interview
process was great.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An offer followed shortly after the second call, which is a bit
ironic since Roberts admits he&#x2019;s not a huge car guy or an
environmentalist. &#x201C;But I do enjoy sustainability and nice cars,&#x201D; he
said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Elon Musk is the real reason I want to work for this company,&#x201D;
he said, referring to the visionary business magnate, investor and
inventor who is CEO and chief product architect of Tesla. &#x201C;The
risks he has taken really inspire me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Roberts will work at the factory in Fremont. &#x201C;I will be doing a
lot of manufacturing execution software (MES) support, and
following analysts around to watch how they work and interact with
clients,&#x201D; Roberts said. MES are computerized systems in
manufacturing &#x2013; &#x201C;information about when things have been shipped,
what&#x2019;s been ordered, progression. It really improves product
output.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Roberts, the 2013-14 student body president, is a senior
<a href="http://itcd.csumb.edu/bs-computer-science-information-technology?utm_source=redirect&amp;utm_medium=marketing&amp;utm_campaign=redirect" rel="nofollow">computer science</a> major with a concentration in
software engineering. He will graduate in December.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When I graduate, I really would love to work for Tesla
full-time,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I think this internship is a good first step
toward trying to get a job there.&#x201D;</p>
