<h3>Eight hands plus one cello = lots of fun</h3>
<p>Stringfever, a London-based string quartet, is a little bit
classical, a little bit rock &apos;n&apos; roll &#x2013; and humorous.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The foursome, which includes the Broadbent brothers (Giles,
Ralph and Neal) and their cousin Graham, will perform at 7:30 p.m.,
April 3, at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">World
Theater</a>.<br>
<br>

trained at London&apos;s Royal Academy and College of Music, will play
American favorites with their brightly colored five- and
six-stringed electric violins, viola and cello. Their unusually
shaped instruments are handmade to order in the United Kingdom.</img></br></br></p>
<p>Stringfever&#x2019;s version of Ravel&#x2019;s Bolero has all four playing one
cello simultaneously. Then they challenge the audience to play Name
That Tune as they race through 20 of the best-loved film themes in
one arrangement. A medley of James Bond themes follows.<br>
<br>
The signature finale, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG6Ef-NQCi4" rel="nofollow">&#x201C;The
History of Music . . . in 5 Minutes,&#x201D;</a> is one of the highlights
of their performance &#x2013; a compilation of 40 tunes packed into a
frenetic five minutes.</br></br></p>
<p>Audience members are raving about Stringfever, said Joe
Cardinelli, artistic director of the World Theater Presents series.
&quot;Their performances have been described as spellbinding, brilliant,
wild, wacky and wholly watchable. Our audience will be delighted
they came.&quot;<br>
