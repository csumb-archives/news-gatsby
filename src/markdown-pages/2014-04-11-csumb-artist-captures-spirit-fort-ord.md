<p>. . . Artist Enid Baxter Ryce lives on what used to be Fort Ord.
As a faculty member in CSUMB&apos;s Cinematic Arts and Technology
Department, she and her husband share a home in repurposed Fort Ord
dwellings. She is in perfect position to produce a work of art like
&quot;Planet Ord,&quot; an ambitious exhibition at the Museum of Art and
History in Santa Cruz.<br>
