<h3>Annual Sanctuary Currents symposium set for April 26</h3>
<p>Most people are aware of our role in polluting the oceans. It is
a rare trip to the beach, even here in the beautiful Monterey Bay,
that doesn&apos;t involve the discovery of marine debris in some form &#x2013;
a beer can, bottle cap or cigarette butt. But there are many
potential solutions, from small-scale beach cleanups to much larger
scale bans on plastic bags.</p>
