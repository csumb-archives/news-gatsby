performed at CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s spring concert on May 4.</img></p>
<p>Featuring music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen
Sondheim, the musical takes the star-crossed-lovers story of &quot;Romeo
and Juliet&quot; and sets it in a gang-rich area of 1950s New York
City.</p>
<p>Familiar songs &#x2013; Maria, Tonight, I Feel Pretty, Somewhere, Jets
&#x2013; will be performed by students in the university&#x2019;s musical theater
production class, the concert band and CSUMB singers.</p>
<p>The concert will get under way at 3 p.m. in the World Theater on
Sixth Avenue between A and B streets on the CSUMB campus. Driving
directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>While the concert is free, attendees must purchase a parking
permit from a dispenser on the lot adjacent to the theater.</p>
