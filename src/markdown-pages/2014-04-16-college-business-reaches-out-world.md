<h3>Scholar from India visits campus, collaborates on research</h3>
<p>In February, CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s College of Business welcomed its
first visiting scholar.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Ganesh Sahu" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ganesh_sahu_sub.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:225px">Dr. Ganesh Sahu may
be the first international researcher to visit, but he&#x2019;s not likely
to be the last.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;His Asian and global perspective will enrich the learning and
knowledge of our students and internationalize their outlook and
education,&#x201D; said Dr. Shyam Kamath, dean of CSUMB&#x2019;s <a href="http://business.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">College of
Business.</a></p>
<p>Dr. Sahu comes from the Motilal Nehru National Institute of
Technology in Allahabad, India, where he is an associate professor
of management and computer information systems. His visit to CSUMB
was made possible by the Indian government through a program &#x2013;
similar to Fulbright Awards &#x2013; that provides scholars an opportunity
to conduct research and to forge relationships with experts in the
United States.</p>
<p>While on campus, he will give research seminars and
presentations and lecture in business classes.</p>

Dr. Sahu will give a research presentation at noon, April 17, in
Valley Hall, Room A116.<br>

<p>Dr. Sahu&#x2019;s current research involves a study of comparative
e-government in India and the United States. He is working on a
project with Dean Kamath and several faculty members, including Dr.
Babita Gupta, who was instrumental in bringing him to campus.</p>
<p>E-government is a global phenomenon. Simply defined, it is the
use of technology to provide information for citizens, allowing
them easy access to government services, and allowing them to
transact business with their government.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kamath, a long-term relationship with the
National Institute of Technology will be explored. Future exchanges
with management schools in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America
are under discussion.</p>
