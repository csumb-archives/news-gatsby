professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, and
graduate student Sam Phillips are collaborating with federal and
state resource agencies to develop the Big Sur River Watershed
Management Plan.&#xA0;</img></p>
<p>The plan details what residents and resource managers can do to
sustain the steelhead population of this local waterway.</p>
<p>The Big Sur River and other ecologically critical streams and
wetlands are constantly threatened by human activities that alter
how water flows over and within the landscape. Land-use changes
such as urbanization and agriculture are the leading cause of
declining salmonid populations along California&apos;s Central Coast.
While some impacts are inevitable, they can be markedly reduced or
avoided through thoughtful and well-considered planning.</p>
<p>The plan developed by Dr. Smith and Phillips describes current
land-use constraints in the context of landslides, erosion,
flooding and other geologic hazards that influence both residents
and the steelhead spawning grounds of the Big Sur River.<br>
