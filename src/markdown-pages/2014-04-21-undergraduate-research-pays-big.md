<p>For the next three years, Allison Moreno won&apos;t have to worry
about how she will pay for graduate school.</p>
<p><img alt="UROC logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/uroc_updated_logo_for_web_0.jpg" style="width:300px; height:94px; float:left">The Cal State
Monterey Bay senior has received a prestigious National Science
Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.</img></p>
<p>Moreno and alumnae Melissa Powell and Sarah Kelly were awarded
the fellowships, which support students in science, technology,
engineering and math-related fields. All will receive $32,000 a
year for three years and a $36,000 cost-of-education allowance to
their universities.</p>
<p>They participated in rigorous research and scholarship while at
CSUMB through the university&#x2019;s <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edi" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a> or UROC.
They won research awards, published their findings and presented
their research at professional conferences.</p>
<p class="pullquote">Thirteen CSUMB students and alumni have earned
NSF graduate fellowships since UROC was established.</p>
<p><img alt="Allison Moreno" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/moreno.allison.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:231px">Moreno (at left),
who was mentored by Dr. Arlene Haffa, will graduate in May with a
major in marine science and minors in biology and math. She will
pursue a Ph.D. in Earth System Science at UC Irvine, where she will
study biogeochemistry, specifically nutrient cycling.</img></p>
<p>Powell, a psychology major and 2013 graduate of CSUMB, is
currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program in STEM education at the
University of California, Irvine. Kelly, who majored in
environmental science, technology and policy before graduating in
2012, is studying for a Ph.D. in fluvial geomorphology at Utah
State University.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The National Science Foundation received over 14,000
applications and awarded only 2,000 fellowships nationwide,&#x201D; said
Dr. William Head, director of UROC. &#x201C;This is NSF&#x2019;s most prestigious
fellowship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Past recipients of the fellowship have included Nobel Prize
winners, former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, Google
co-founder Sergey Brin and author Steven Levitt.</p>
<p>UROC was established in 2009, and since then it has earned a
national reputation for excellence, achievement and leadership.
Moreno is an example of how it benefits students.</p>
<p>&quot;UROC has helped me to articulate my research interests in a way
that others can see my passion and focus,&quot; she said. UROC
introduced her to the NSF program and helped with the application
process.</p>
<p>&quot;And the UROC research seminar courses helped me to grow as an
individual, researcher and scholar,&quot; she said.</p>
