<p>National Undergraduate Research Week takes place April 14

<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, it&#x2019;s an annual celebration of research and
creative activity. Undergraduates can explore the opportunities
available to them and find ways to get involved.</p>

in the university&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center
(known as UROC) have planned several events to encourage students
to do just that.</img></p>
<p>Those events &#x2013; organized by Molly Fredle, Alexis Ingram and
Andrea Valdez &#x2013; include talks, a poster session and an open house
and mixer. All of them will take place at the UROC office, Suite
2150 in the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.</p>
<p>&#x2022; April 14, noon to 1:30 p.m., researcher talks. Students are
invited to learn how research can benefit them. Topics to be
presented by fellow students include how to get involved, the
research experience and how it prepares them for graduate
school.</p>
<p>&#x2022; April 15, 2 to 3:30 p.m., poster session. From sharks to
methamphetamine use to aging, the variety of research being
conducted by CSUMB students will be on display.</p>
<p>&#x2022; April 16, 2 to 3:30 p.m., research group open house and mixer.
UROC scholars and their mentors will be available to talk about the
opportunities available on campus.</p>
<p>The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center at CSUMB was
established in 2009. With training and support from UROC, students
work on innovative research projects on campus and at other
research institutions.&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Undergraduate research engages students at the highest
scholarly levels by linking research, learning and mentorship to
real world experiences,&#x201D; said Dr. William Head, director of UROC.
&#x201C;This translates to long-term academic success, self-confidence and
persistence and has career benefits.&#x201D;<br>
