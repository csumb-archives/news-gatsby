<h3>All-female group visits April 30, May 1</h3>
<p>In a musical genre dominated by men, Mariachi Reyna de Los
Angeles has been breaking stereotypes and shaping new cultural
traditions since 1994.</p>
<p>The 12-member all-female group brings sensitivity, beauty and
warmth to Mexico&#x2019;s musical heritage and has earned a reputation in
the industry as a pioneer. Back by pipular demand after thrilling
sold-out performances the last three years, Mariachi Reyna will
return to CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s World Theater for performances on
April 30 and May 1. Both shows will start at 7:30 p.m.</p>

all-female mariachi groups, proving that when maestro Jose
Hernandez created Reyna de Los Angeles, it wasn&#x2019;t a novelty &#x2013; it
was a genre. Reyna has expanded the role of women in mariachi from
singers to a full complement of musical performers. In a musical
landscape where songs are often written by men and about male
perspectives, Reyna has created its own history.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I knew there were enough excellent female musicians to do it,
and I didn&#x2019;t want guys to say, &#x2018;They play like girls,&#x2019; &#x201D; Hernandez
said. &#x201C;Now guys from other groups come up to me and tell me that
they can&#x2019;t get over how these girls sound so amazing. It&#x2019;s because
they sound like angels, and that&#x2019;s why they are named after the
City of Angeles.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Under Hernandez, the group has released three albums: Solo Tuyo
(Yours Only), El Mejor Mariachi Feminino del Mundo (The Best Female
Mariachi in the World), and Companeras, which was nominated for
Grammy and Latin Grammy awards in 2009.</p>
<p>The group will be on stage at the World Theater in time for
Cinco de Mayo. The booking wasn&#x2019;t an accident.</p>

World Theater hosts a production commemorating Cinco de Mayo,&#x201D; said
Joe Cardinelli, executive director of university performances and
special events.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Besides presenting an evening of memorable music and song,
Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles&#x2019; performance follows our mission to
educate and enlighten our campus and local communities through
