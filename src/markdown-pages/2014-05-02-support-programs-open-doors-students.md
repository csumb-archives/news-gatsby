<h3>Seniors celebrated at EOP event</h3>
<p>Marina Rico, the youngest of seven siblings, grew up in an
agricultural area of Monterey County. Her parents did not finish
the second grade.</p>
<p>The school system failed to inspire her to continue her
education, but at the last minute she enrolled&#xA0;<img alt="EOP logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/eop_copy_0.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px">in the local
community college. With assistance from support programs at
Hartnell College, she transferred to CSU Monterey Bay two years
later and was admitted into the university&#x2019;s <a href="http://eosp.csumb.edu/educational-opportunity-program?_csumbsearch=EOP" rel="nofollow">Educational Opportunity Program</a> (EOP).</img></p>
<p>Like most first-generation college students, she had no one to
help her navigate the university. However, in EOP, &#x201C;I got a lot of
personal support from people who believed in my ability to continue
my education. I never felt judged about where I came from.&#x201D; Rico
said.</p>
<p>She took advantage of the services EOP offered, and on May 2,
she and 63 other students will be honored at the sixth annual
Educational Opportunity Program and <a href="http://eosp.csumb.edu/trio-student-support-services-sss" rel="nofollow">TRiO Student Support Services</a> (SSS) Senior
Celebration.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s just the first celebration Rico will attend. At the May 16
Honors Convocation, she&#x2019;ll receive this year&#x2019;s Alumni Vision Award,
given to a member of the graduating class who exemplifies CSUMB&#x2019;s
vision of diversity, academic excellence and service. The next day,
she&#x2019;ll be awarded a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in psychology at
commencement.</p>

designed to support and retain low-income and educationally
disadvantaged students in their pursuit of a college degree.
Services include academic advising, peer mentoring and support,
academic and personal development workshops, and cultural
enrichment activities.</img></p>
<p>All are intended to help students realize their potential and
create a better future for themselves, their families and their
communities.</p>
<p>Like Rico, most EOP and SSS participants are the first in their
families to attend a university. They face more challenges &#x2013;
socially, economically and academically &#x2013; than traditional
students. Despite the additional obstacles, the retention rate for
EOP and SSS students has consistently exceeded the retention rate
of the total CSUMB student population.</p>
<p>&#x201C;EOP helped me to believe in myself,&#x201D; Rico said. And that was
all she needed.<br>
