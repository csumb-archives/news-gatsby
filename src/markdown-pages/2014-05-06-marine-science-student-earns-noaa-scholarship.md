<p>Emily Aiken sounds like a campus recruiter when she explains why
she chose CSU Monterey Bay for graduate school.</p>
<p><img alt="Emily in diving mask" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/emily_in_mask_for_web.jpg" style="width:300px; height:361px; float:left">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s got a booming
marine science program,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and an excellent faculty who
are actively involved in research and serve as great advisers.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Then she shifts into Chamber-of-Commerce mode and mentions the
close proximity to a pristine coastline, the &#x201C;incredible&#x201D; diving
and recreational opportunities, and &#x201C;breathtaking landscapes and
seascapes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Aiken is about to graduate with a degree in marine science and
has chosen to stay at CSUMB to pursue a master&#x2019;s degree in Applied
Marine and Watershed Science.</p>
<p>The Morongo Valley native has gotten help to cover the costs:
she has been awarded a coveted Nancy Foster Scholarship by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x2019;s Office of
National Marine Sanctuaries.</p>
<p>The scholarship will give her $42,000 a year for two years to
cover the cost of tuition and provide salary and travel
support.</p>
<p>Aiken will work in CSUMB&#x2019;s Institute for Applied Marine Ecology
(IfAME). Her thesis will be developed around a remotely operated
vehicle project in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine
Sanctuary, looking at the distribution of fishes relative to deep
water corals.</p>

with the university&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center,
she led several underwater projects, participated in research
cruises and collaborated with the Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary to conserve its resources.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;My long-term goal is to continue my involvement with the marine
sanctuaries in conserving our nation&#x2019;s natural and cultural
heritage through research and public outreach,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>Aiken is the third CSUMB graduate student in the last four years
to be awarded a Foster scholarship.</p>
<p>The Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship program recognizes outstanding
scholarship and encourages independent graduate-level research in
marine sciences &#x2013; particularly by female and minority students.
Only a few are awarded annually.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the program soon after Dr. Foster&#x2019;s death in
June 2000, as a means of honoring her life&#x2019;s work as a marine
scientist and her contribution to the nation.</p>
