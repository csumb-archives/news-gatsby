<h3>&apos;CSUMB made a difference for me&apos;</h3>
<p>Tina Banks has beaten the odds.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 800,000 military veterans attending
college, more than 80 percent drop out of school during their first
year and only 3 percent graduate, according to a report by the
University of Colorado Denver.<br>
<br>

members who are adept at patching wounded soldiers, defusing bombs
or tracking the enemy have a difficult time navigating a college
campus or completing a class assignment. The reasons vary. For
those experiencing post-traumatic stress syndrome, anxiety and
sleeplessness are often triggered by daily stress &#x2013; for example, by
exams.<br>
<br>
Banks was a U.S. Air Force medic who had to deal with severe
symptoms of PTSD as a result of her service. She went through
counseling at the Veterans Administration and tried various
medications, but finally found an answer through a group called
Four Paws for Vets, which matched her with Hans, a service
dog.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Hans keeps a block between me and other people, lets me know if
someone is approaching me from the rear, picks up things that I
drop and even wakes me when I have nightmares,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
Before Hans, Banks said she was a disabled veteran, agoraphobic,
and with a poor quality of life. &#x201C;Since getting Hans, I&#x2019;m a
disabled vet who leaves the house at will and lives life
undaunted.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
As part of regaining her life and independence, she and Hans came
to CSU Monterey Bay. &#x201C;I decided to get my degree to further push
myself through the struggles I have being around a lot of people,&#x201D;
Banks said.<br>

<p>&#x201C;Now here I am, two years later, graduating with honors,
navigating the world with less anxiety and living a life rich with
friends and a new-found hope for my life. CSUMB made a difference
for me and Hans.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The human communication major &#x2013; she has pursued a concentration in
creative writing and social action &#x2013; is a more polished writer than
when she came to the university. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be working on my own book of
short stories this summer,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;My life now is like night and day. I&#x2019;m doing so much better than I
was four years ago, and I may even retire Hans within the next year
or two.&#x201D;<br>
