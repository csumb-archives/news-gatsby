<h3>University partners with local agencies to recycle, reuse</h3>
<p>Some interesting &#x2013; and valuable &#x2013; stuff gets discarded during
the rush to clean out residence hall rooms and move home for the
summer.</p>
<p><img alt="A student volunteer at Move Out 2012" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/move-out.jpg" style="width:350px; height:301px; float:left">At the start of
this year&#x2019;s annual rite of spring, one student volunteer recounted
finding a perfectly good set of golf clubs that had been abandoned
last year. He claimed them, and is still using the clubs, he
said.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;In the past, so many reusable items have been thrown away that
people from off campus came to rummage through our dumpsters,&#x201D; said
Anya Spear, associate director of campus planning at CSU Monterey
Bay.</p>
<p>In addition to sporting goods, electronics, clothing, furniture,
lamps, microwaves, food, clothing and toiletries got haphazardly
thrown in dumpsters when they could have been donated to
organizations that serve the community.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Spear and student volunteers have been working to
change the culture of waste with an event called Move Out. This
year&#x2019;s event runs from May 9 through 17, when 1,800 students will
vacate their rooms. It is CSUMB&#x2019;s largest waste diversion and
educational outreach event of the year.</p>
<p>Last year&#x2019;s event generated 17 tons (or 34,120 lbs.) of waste,
recycling and donations on main campus alone; 7 tons were diverted
from the landfill, a 42 percent diversion rate. After this
year&#x2019;s&#xA0;<img alt="A chalk message reminds students to recycle" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/chalk.jpg" style="width:300px; height:201px; float:right">first week, Hope
Services estimates it has collected 800 pounds of reusable goods.
Revenue generated by the sale of these items will help to fund the
non-profit&#x2019;s programs for people with developmental
disabilities.</img></p>
<p>This year&#x2019;s effort has been ramped up, with more volunteers to
help educate students, more convenient places to discard
recyclables, more education about the importance of the issue and
more community partners.</p>
<p>A schedule and recycling guide have been posted in every
residence hall. Blue donation carts, where clothing, small
household goods and e-waste can be deposited, are located outside
the halls. Barrels for food donations are located in the lobby of
each building. Big dumpsters are located on several parking lots,
clearly labeled for recyclables and garbage.</p>
<p>Sara Treat, environmental outreach coordinator for GreenWaste,
the university&#x2019;s waste hauler, pointed out that having volunteers
at donation stations is helpful. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re getting questions from
students, indicating that students are thinking about the issue as
they pack up,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>GreenWaste is among the community partners working with the
university. Hope Services, Goodwill Industries and the Food Bank
for Monterey County are also working with the university.</p>
<p>This year, donation collection services are available in East
Campus for the first time. Curbside collection for furniture and
other bulky items will be offered on May 16 and 19.</p>
<p>Move Out isn&#x2019;t the only environmentally friendly end-of-semester
event.</p>
<p>A local Boy Scout troop will help make commencement a
near-zero-waste event. The scouts will staff waste sorting
stations, making sure trash, recycling and compost go in the proper
containers. After the event, they will bag all waste streams and
scour the stadium to collect recyclables that were left behind. The
money raised from the recycling fee refund will help to send the
boys to camp.</p>
