<h3>Capstone Festival set for May 14, 15 and 16</h3>
<p>Alyssa Nally has been working with the Monterey chapter of the
Surfrider Foundation, implementing the foundation&#x2019;s Rise Above
Plastics program.<br>
<br>

Monterey Bay requirement that all students complete a capstone &#x2013; a
creative or research project &#x2013; the marine science major developed a
presentation for elementary school students. Nally&#x2019;s presentation
teaches the youngsters about the negative impacts of plastic
pollution on marine ecosystems, and why it is important to reduce
plastic consumption.<br>
<br>
She has given the presentation to hundreds of students in Marina
and King City and hopes those children will spread the word to
their families and friends, and to the community.<br>
<br>
Visual and Public Art major Rachell Hester&#x2019;s capstone project &#x2013; a
14-piece installation she calls Imperceptions &#x2013; explores
preconceived notions of outward appearance and deeper meaning. The
portraits depict first impressions and challenge viewers to expand
their narrow focus on individual stereotypes and open up to a
bigger story.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The installation forces the viewer to step back in order to fully
appreciate the magnitude of each subject and combined expressions,&#x201D;
Hester told the Otter Realm.<br>
<br>
Both projects fulfilled a requirement facing graduating seniors at
colleges and universities across the country. By requiring a
capstone project, the schools want undergraduates to pull together,
synthesize and apply years of learning.<br>
<br>
At Cal State Monterey Bay, all students have been required to do
capstone projects since the first graduating class in 1997. Some of
those projects are archived in the campus library. (View the
archive <a href="http://capstone.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>During the Capstone Festival held at the end of each semester,
the campus takes on the feel of an intellectual marketplace. At
recent festivals, a biology major presented a study of human stem
cell proliferation, a social and behavioral sciences major looked
at women police officers in American society and a psychology
student examined the socialization of sarcasm.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;Business students, working in teams, presented strategic
business plans for local companies and organizations.&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
<img alt="Capstone logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/seniorcapstone_0.jpg" style="width:300px; height:158px; float:right">A World Languages
and Cultures student gave a 25-minute talk &#x2013; entirely in Japanese &#x2013;
on the arguments for and against changing Article 9 of the Japanese
constitution. A PowerPoint presentation running in the background
provided the information in English.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
And a music major &#x2013; with help from his friends &#x2013; performed a
three-movement piece he composed for a brass quartet.&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#xFFFD;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
While the projects require a great deal of time and effort, they&#x2019;re
worth it. Research by the Association of American Colleges and
Universities (AACU) has found that capstone projects are a
high-impact educational practice. Participation in these practices
can be &#x201C;life-changing,&#x201D; according to the AACU&apos;s research.<br>
<br>
&quot;Increasingly, people want to know what students can do with their
learning and how they can apply that learning across all the
courses in their college,&quot; the AACU&#x2019;s Carol Grear Schneider told
the Los Angeles Times.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;In addition, she told The Times, colleges want to do a better job
of preparing graduates for the demands of the job market and
graduate schools. The capstones, she said, help students &quot;become
people who can problem-solve and produce something of high
quality.&quot;<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;Research by the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)
shows a steady increase in those completing capstones. In 2013, 45
percent of students reported doing such a project compared to nine
percent in 2000.&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Campus-wide requirements like the one at CSUMB are most common at
liberal arts colleges, where 74 percent of students reported
completing a capstone project in 2013. At large research
universities, 45 percent of students produced capstones that year,
according to NSSE.<br>
<br>
