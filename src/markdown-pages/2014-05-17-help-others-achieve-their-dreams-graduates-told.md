<h3>Obama administration official is commencement keynote
speaker</h3>
<p>On a breezy, sunny morning, Cecilia Mu&#xF1;oz urged the graduates of
California State University, Monterey Bay to maintain the quest for
learning that brought them to the university.</p>

adviser to President Obama and director of the Domestic Policy
Council, was the keynote speaker at the university&#x2019;s May 17
commencement.</img></p>
<p>Approximately 1,440 students were awarded bachelor&#x2019;s and
master&#x2019;s degrees and teaching credentials before a capacity crowd
of 8,000 in the university&#x2019;s stadium.</p>
<p>Ms. Mu&#xF1;oz reminded the audience that CSUMB students contribute
60,000 hours of community service each year and urged the graduates
to build on that spirit of service as they leave the
university.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This should come with a word of caution &#x2013; that spirit of
service may become your life&#x2019;s work,&#x201D; she said. She advised
graduates to continue to engage with the people around them,
&#x201C;especially those who are different from you.&#x201D; And, she suggested
that they indulge in a little peace and quiet every now and
then.</p>
<p>Her last piece of advice: &#x201C;Always be grateful to the people who
got you here, and pay it forward by helping others achieve their
dreams.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Julie Packard urged the
graduates to action.</p>
<p>Ms. Packard was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree at
the ceremony. She and the aquarium have become a force for
advancing ocean conservation worldwide through the aquarium&#x2019;s
exhibits and programs, and its work in scientific research,
education and public policy.</p>

central to our lives,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s our pantry, our lungs, our
playground. It&#x2019;s a massive driver of global commerce and an
incubator for innovative technologies that will drive our
future.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>She told the students &#x201C;unless we wake up and attend to the
nature that sustains us, we won&#x2019;t be able to pursue our dreams and
aspirations, whatever they may be.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You have the power for change,&#x201D; she reminded them. &#x201C;Use
it.&#x201D;</p>

opened with the traditional welcome in Spanish, Japanese, Chinese
and Vietnamese, delivered by the members of the faculty. Student
speaker Alijah Jade Marquez, winner of the President&#x2019;s Award for
Exemplary Student Achievement, was next on the podium. She reminded
students that everyone has the ability to impact the world, by
saving the life of a friend or influencing the lives of millions.
&#x201C;No act is insignificant,&#x201D; she said.</img></p>
<p>Dr. David Anderson from the Division of Social, Behavioral and
Global Studies, and Dr. Josina Makau from the Division of
Humanities and Communication, were awarded emeritus status
acknowledging their service to the university.</p>
