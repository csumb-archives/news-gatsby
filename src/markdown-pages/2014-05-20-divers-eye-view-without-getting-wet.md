<h3>CSUMB&apos;s Seafloor Mapping Lab helps with Point Lobos
project</h3>
<p>Visitors to Point Lobos State Marine Reserve are now able to
visualize what the undersea world looks like, thanks in part to
work by students and staff members of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Seafloor
Mapping Lab.</p>
<p>Data collected by the lab was used to create a 3D model of the
underwater park, which helps visitors understand what lies beneath
the sea. Until now, only divers could experience the mysterious
underwater seascape of Point Lobos, with its kelp forests, schools
of fish and marine mammals.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Kvitek and the KelpFly" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kelpflywork_small_0.jpg" style="width:350px; height:243px; float:right">The museum-quality
model was years in the making. In 2010, members of the Bay Area
Underwater Explorers (BAUE) began a project to fill the gaps in the
existing mapping data. It quickly became apparent their approach
wasn&#x2019;t going to work &#x2013; the area to be mapped was simply too
big.</img></p>
<p>They turned to CSUMB&#x2019;s Seafloor Mapping Lab and its director,
Dr. Rikk Kvitek, for help. The lab used the KelpFly, a hybrid
airboat/160-horsepower Yamaha watercraft with an array of sonar
equipment, to map the terrain with great detail and accuracy.</p>
<p>The data collected by the KelpFly was used to create a foam
model, which served as a cast for the 800-pound sand-colored
concrete version. The model is now on display adjacent to the
Whalers Cove parking lot.</p>
<p>Gary Banta, a diver with BAUE, spearheaded the project and
raised funds to finance it. He told the Carmel Pine Cone &#x201C;my hope
is that this model will be a window to this stunning reserve,
allowing generations of visitors to experience its wonders.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dr. Kvitek has mapped more than 1,200 square kilometers of
California&#x2019;s coastal waters, providing topographical data of the
seafloor extending three miles from the coast. The KelpFly, named
for an insect that lives on kelp, allows him to gather data in
areas just along the shore that his larger research vessels can&#x2019;t
access, such as Whalers Cove.</p>
<p>The $300,000 craft can maneuver in water as shallow as 18
inches. It features an armored hull that allows it to bounce off
rocks and a flotation collar that makes it stable in surf.</p>
