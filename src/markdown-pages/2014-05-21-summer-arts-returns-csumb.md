<p>CSU Summer Arts is dedicated to transforming artists&#x2019; lives by
broadening their creative skills, subject matter knowledge and
ability to represent their work in public performance or
exhibition. Because it is similar to an artistic retreat and
apprenticeship program, it also helps students build bridges to
future employment.<br>
