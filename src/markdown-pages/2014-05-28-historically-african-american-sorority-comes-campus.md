<p>For more than a century, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority has been
committed to public service, with a primary focus on the black
community.<br>

chapter at CSU Monterey Bay, the first historically African
American sorority established on campus.<br>
<br>
The Upsilon Xi chapter was chartered in April with seven members:
Diamond Gaskins, Shiyla Goodie, Nancy Her, Brigette Johnson, Tyler
Posey, Courtney Thomas and Tiffany Williams.</br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>The chapter plans service projects for the fall that focus on
physical and mental health issues that include all students,
specifically geared toward under-represented women.</p>
<p>Delta Sigma Theta is the largest black Greek organization in the
country. More than a thousand chapters have initiated 200,000
members. It was founded in 1913 at Howard University to promote
academic excellence and provide assistance to those in need.</p>
<p>Delta Sigma Theta is the eighth sorority to be chartered at
CSUMB; six fraternities are also active. (A complete list can be
found <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/multicultural-greek-council-0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)</p>
<p>&quot;We are grateful for CSUMB&apos;s enthusiastic support for a
collegiate chapter. Upsilon Xi will extend Delta&apos;s legacy of
scholarship, service and sisterhood to the campus community, while
connecting members committed to public service,&quot; said Brenda
Grayson Shinault, the chapter&apos;s primary adviser and a member of the
sorority&#x2019;s Monterey Peninsula alumnae chapter.</p>
