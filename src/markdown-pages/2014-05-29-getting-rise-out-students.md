<p>&#x201C;Throughout high school, the RISE program had a strong impact on
my decision to pursue a degree in biology,&#x201D; said Charn Singh, who
just finished her junior year at CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>&#x201C;RISE expanded my interest in science and provided me invaluable
support and guidance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Singh&#x2019;s experience is exactly what the RISE &#x2013; Recruitment in
Science Education &#x2013; program was created to do.</p>
<p>This year&#x2019;s class of 32 high school students attended a
graduation ceremony at CSUMB on May 21.</p>
<p><img alt="RISE students od hands-on science projects" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/rise_photo.jpg" style="width:300px; height:200px; float:right">RISE recruits high
school students from underrepresented backgrounds and involves them
in hands-on activities and fields trips. Its goals: to expose them
to science, encourage them to attend college and pursue a STEM &#x2013;
science, technology, engineering, math &#x2013; major. The mission is to
enhance diversity in the sciences.</img></p>
<p>It works. All of this year&#x2019;s graduates are planning to attend a
two-year or four-year college or university; 11 have been accepted
to CSUMB. Those heading to four-year schools receive a $1,000
scholarship; the community college students are given $500 per
year. Once in college, those who pursue a STEM major are eligible
to renew their scholarships.</p>
<p>Each year, a new crop of ninth-graders is recruited based on
recommendations from teachers and counselors. They meet once a
week; the continuing students meet separately. Sessions are held at
Marina and North Salinas high schools.</p>
<p>The RISE curriculum supplements what the students are learning
at school. They learn science concepts, research methods and lab
techniques as well as academic skills. They also visit college
campuses, where they can sometimes connect with RISE alumni.</p>
<p>&#x201C;RISE helped me to set goals and prepare for college,&#x201D; said
Dalia Rojas, a psychology major at CSUMB who will be a junior in
the fall. &#x201C;RISE exposed me to different experiences. I am grateful
for all of these experiences and trips that I took with the RISE
program because it helped shape me to be the person I am
today.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The RISE program was created in 1998 by a gift from the
Berkshire Foundation. For more information, contact program
