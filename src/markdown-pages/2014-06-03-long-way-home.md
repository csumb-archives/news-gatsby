<h3>Cycling across America to help the homeless</h3>
<p>After commencement, Daniel Troia didn&apos;t spent much time
celebrating. Nine days after receiving his degree in kinesiology,
he and current student Luke Young headed off on a 3,500-mile
cross-country bike ride to see America and to raise money for a
good cause.</p>

20-hour train ride from Salinas to Portland, arriving on May 26.
Their adventure began in earnest on June 1, when they left Oregon
and headed to Idaho. They expect to arrive in New York City in
about 10 weeks &#x2013; in time for Young to get back to campus to
complete his degree in environmental science.</img></p>
<p>Troia, 28, from Monterey, and Young, 25, from Murrieta,
understand the trip will be strenuous, uncomfortable and maybe even
dangerous.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But no matter how difficult our life gets on the road, I plan
to keep reminding myself that what I&#x2019;m going through is much easier
than the lives of people who are homeless on the streets of
Monterey County,&#x201D; Troia told the Monterey County Herald.</p>
<p><img alt="Luke Young" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/luke_young.jpg" style="width:250px; height:333px; float:right">Troia and Young
are asking people to sponsor their trip by making a donation to
Dorothy&#x2019;s Place, a facility in Salinas where the Franciscan Workers
of Junipero Serra provide meals, services and support to the
homeless. The center also includes a 24-hour women&#x2019;s shelter.</img></p>
<p>He and Young visited Dorothy&#x2019;s Place several weeks before
departing on their cross-country trip. They were caught off guard
by what they saw in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Neither of us could believe the conditions people were living
in,&#x201D; Troia told the Herald. &#x201C;For somebody like me, who was born and
raised in Monterey, it was shocking to realize that so many people
were living like that just 25 minutes away.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They expect to average 60 miles a day. En route to New York,
they will travel through Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North
Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.<br>
