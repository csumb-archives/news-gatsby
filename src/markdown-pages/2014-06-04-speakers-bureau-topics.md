<p>CSUMB faculty and staff members are currently offering talks on
the following topics:</p>
<p><strong>Research at CSUMB: Why we do it and what it means for
the Monterey Bay region</strong><br>
Researchers at the university bring in millions of dollars in
grants. Those funds create jobs and support the development of new
knowledge. We&#x2019;re eager to discuss economic development and to share
ideas for cooperation and collaboration between the university and
industry.<br>
&#x2013; University administrator</br></br></p>
<p><strong>From &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve Got to be Kidding!&#x2019; to &#x2018;Ah-Ha!&#x2019; &#x2013; Hope for
our oceans through insight and innovation</strong><br>
The talk discusses innovative ways to address the unprecedented
threats of climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification,
pollution, fishery declines, coastal erosion, algal blooms and
storm intensification on the coastal oceans and communities.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Rikk Kvitek<br>
<br>
<strong>Peeling back the blue: How we map and use 3D visualization
to reveal and learn from Earth&#x2019;s hidden seafloor
landscapes</strong><br>
Although the global ocean is the driver of weather, a highway for
marine commerce, a reservoir of vast marine resources, and our
playground, we know more about distant planets than we do about the
seafloor. Imagine if the next time you were standing at the ocean&apos;s
edge that instead of watching crashing waves, you were able to
visualize submarine canyons, underwater seamounts and ridges, and
even a kelp forest teeming with marine life. The State of
California has undertaken a cutting-edge project to make this
possible by mapping the seafloor of all the state&apos;s waters. Dr.
Kvitek will show you the first images created from this effort and
share with you how this new information is already being used in a
multitude of ways.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Rikk Kvitek</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kvitek</strong> is a professor in the Division of
Science and Environmental Policy, where he directs the CSUMB
Seafloor Mapping Lab. He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in zoology from
the University of Michigan, a master&#x2019;s at Moss Landing Marine Labs,
and Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Washington. His
research with whales, sea otters, walrus, sea birds, fish,
icebergs, submarine canyons and numerous invertebrates from the
Arctic to the Antarctic has brought novel insights to the fields of
benthic ecology, seafloor disturbance, habitat mapping and species
relations, and the effects of harmful algal bloom toxins in marine
food chains. Beginning with SCUBA, Dr. Kvitek quickly realized that
detailed bird&#x2019;s-eye views of the seafloor could do for marine
research what aerial photography had done for terrestrial studies,
and now specializes in bringing seafloor habitats to life with high
resolution remote sensing and 3D visualization</p>
<p><strong>Science with a mission at CSUMB</strong><br>
The CSUMB Science Division includes experts from both terrestrial
and marine realms. Their common mission is to use sound science to
solve environmental problems in the tri-county area. They use
cutting-edge technology and student power for the good of the
community.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Doug Smith</br></br></p>
<p><strong>San Clemente Dam removal</strong><br>
San Clemente Dam will be removed from the Carmel River to reduce
the risk of dam failure and to foster the historic salmon run. This
large-scale project will have long-term impacts on the watershed,
and could be a model for other dam removal projects in
California.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Doug Smith</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Water Resources on the Monterey Peninsula</strong><br>
People on the coast between Carmel and Seaside have been seeking a
sustainable water resource for decades. The search has been fraught
with technical, political and legal pitfalls. What are the
technical solutions? What are the political/legal constraints?
What&apos;s the latest plan?<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Doug Smith</br></br></p>
<p><strong>The geology of coastal Monterey County: Resource
opportunities and geological hazards</strong><br>
Wherever you stand, there is a stack of rocks below your feet that
records the local geological history and governs the kind of urban
development that is suited to the region. We will consider the
water resources and environmental hazards of our region. Water is
scarce, and urban expansion is locally constrained by coastal
erosion, landslides and hill slope erosion potential.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Doug Smith</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Institute for Applied Marine Ecology
(IfAME)</strong><br>
The primary goal of the IfAME is to provide science in support of
government decision-making ranging from local municipalities to
state, federal and international governments. That science includes
monitoring the new state marine protected areas along California&apos;s
coast, exploring the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries from
Monterey to New England, studying the impact of commercial bottom
trawling on seafloor habitats around the world, and diving from the
world&apos;s only undersea laboratory in the Florida Keys. The closely
linked secondary goal is to involve CSUMB students in the conduct
of this research.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. James Lindholm</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Math, revealed &#x2013; Cracking the mysteries of math for
youngsters</strong><br>
New research examining thousands of students in two dozen
California school districts finds that students already doing well
in math in the seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math
courses in high school and meet college entrance requirements. But
for many students who struggle with math in grade seven, there is
no clear path to learning and achievement. CSUMB math professor
Hongde Hu uses math games, engaging presentations and curriculum he
has been refining for years to reach those youngsters.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Hongde Hu</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Innovation in higher education</strong><br>
Higher education is facing challenges in an era of increased
demand, changing demographics and declining state support. American
colleges and universities will need to adopt new educational
approaches and technologies to serve more students while
maintaining quality. CSUMB is addressing this through a variety of
ways: a new three-year computer science degree developed in
partnership with Hartnell College; creation of an Institute for
Innovation and Economic Development; and exploring the potential to
use technology for online programs.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Eric Tao</br></br></p>
<p><strong>From iPhone Apps to Flying Drones &#x2013; Computing and
engineering education at CSUMB</strong><br>
&#x2013; Dr. Eric Tao</br></p>
<p><strong>Eyewitness memory</strong><br>
Eyewitnesses are notoriously bad in the identification of the
perpetrator of a crime. If you witness a crime, can you be sure
that your memory for that event is accurate? Not really. Scientific
evidence explains that memory changes over time, is malleable and
is easy to manipulate via suggestibility and misattribution. Find
out why eyewitnesses are so bad at remembering details of the crime
and in the identification of the perpetrator.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Jill Yamashita<br>
<br>
<strong>Creating memories for events that never
happened</strong><br>
False memories are the remembering of events that never took place.
Memory is easily manipulated and can change without our awareness.
Memory research shows that it is easy to create false memories (for
example, a memory of getting lost in the mall). One of the issues
with false memory is that you cannot tell the difference between a
false memory and a real one.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Jill Yamashita<br>
<br>
<strong>They all look the same: The other-race
effect</strong><br>
The other-race effect is a deficit in the ability to recognize or
identify a face that is of a different race. You might hear a child
say, &#x201C;All of the faces look the same,&#x201D; which is common response
when looking at faces of an unfamiliar or different race. I examine
what influences the other-race effect and what helps to minimize
this effect.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Jill Yamashita</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>A vision for service: At CSUMB, giving back is a core
value</strong><br>
CSUMB has won national acclaim for integrating community service
with each student&#x2019;s academic experience, and is changing lives &#x2013;
and our ideas about learning and community &#x2013; in the process<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Seth Pollack</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Mexican entrepreneurs: A new look to
immigration</strong><br>
Immigrants aren&#x2019;t always who you think they are.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Juan Gutierrez<br>
<br>
<strong>Creating customer loyalty</strong><br>
John Avella, head of CSUMB&#x2019;s hospitality program, has 40 years of
human resource development and teaching experience in the
hospitality industry. He has been vice president of human resources
for Marriott Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the
World, and president of Human Resource Concepts. His work focused
on management and executive development, Customer service and
organizational strategic change. He has studied the application of
emotional intelligence to customer service/loyalty, emotional labor
and leadership. He has developed a process that teaches people to
&#x201C;connect&#x201D; to the customer.</br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><strong>The region&#x2019;s hospitality industry &#x2013; what&#x2019;s
ahead?</strong><br>
The lingering effects of the recession and looming water problems
are just two issues facing the local tourism/hospitality industry.
What&#x2019;s on the horizon?<br>
&#x2013; Dr. John Avella</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Sustainable hospitality management</strong><br>
&#x2013; Dr. John Avella</br></p>
<p><strong>Kinesiology gains in popularity</strong><br>
Kinesiology &#x2013; the study of human movement &#x2013; is the fastest-growing
major on campus. As the U.S. population skews older &#x2013; and fatter &#x2013;
there&#x2019;s a demand for fitness trainers, physical therapists and
researchers who study the science of movement and performance. Dr.
Kent Adams, a prolific researcher as well as head of the
kinesiology department, shares his findings to help people keep fit
across the lifespan.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Kent Adams</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Nursing program will meet a need</strong><br>
The health care industry is coping with the &#x201C;silver tsunami&#x201D; of
aging baby boomers, combined with the impact of health care reform.
Nurses will play a big role in meeting both challenges, but will
need more than a two-year degree to do so. CSUMB has partnered with
four community colleges in the region to offer a four-year degree
that prepares them to serve as health care navigators, helping
patients manage multiple conditions such as hypertension and
diabetes outside a hospital setting.<br>
&#x2013; Marianne Hultgren</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Unraveling standardized testing and
evaluation</strong><br>
Mark O&#x2019;Shea, a professor education at CSUMB, has been studying the
standards movement from the perspective of the classroom teacher
for years. He has conducted extensive clinical research in
standards-based education and has consulted with school districts
and state departments of education. He can also talk about the new
Common Core standards &#x2013; he helped state officials develop the
science standards &#x2013; and their implementation in California.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Mark O&#x2019;Shea</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Technology in the classroom</strong><br>
Technology is being used to expand curriculum options, maximize
scarce resources, increase teacher and student engagement, and
improve outcomes. It delivers a new type of interactive education
to meet the needs and requirements of 21st century learners as
global citizens. Dr. Lockwood has a particular interest in
encouraging technology education as part of the K-12 curriculum and
encouraging women/girls in STEM fields as well.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Kate Lockwood</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Digging through time</strong><br>
Dr. Ruben Mendoza is an archaeologist, writer, and photographer who
has explored the length and breadth of Mexico, Central America,
Europe, and the U.S. Southwest documenting both pre-Columbian and
Colonial era sites and collections. He has directed major
archaeological investigations and conservation projects at missions
San Juan Bautista, Carmel, and Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de la Soledad, among
others. Recent efforts at the Royal Presidio of Monterey resulted
in the tandem discovery of the earliest Serra era Christian houses
of worship in California dated to 1770 and 1771. And he has made
astronomically and liturgically significant discoveries of
solstice, equinox, and feast day solar illuminations of mission
church altars throughout California, the U.S. Southwest, and
Mesoamerica.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Ruben Mendoza</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute is bringing seniors
back to school</strong><br>
Are you sitting on an idea for the next great American novel and
don&apos;t know how to begin? Would you like to understand contemporary
art? Ever wonder where our special brand of weather comes from?
Would you like to know the history of Cannery Row? Then the Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI@CSUMB) is the place for you.
These are just some of the topics that have been covered in courses
that range from one day to eight weeks during the Fall and Spring
semesters each year. For adults age 50 or better and funded in part
by the Bernard Osher Foundation, many of our courses are taught by
CSUMB professors. There are no test and no grades, just good fun
and great fellowship with friends and neighbors in our region.
Learn how and why OLLI@CSUMB came into being and how it has evolved
to reflect the interests of our adult learners.<br>
&#x2013; Michele Crompton</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Summer Arts</strong><br>
Sword fights, improvisational comedy, animation, painting: Summer
school was never this much fun. Several hundred students &#x2013; high
school, college, and adult members of the local community &#x2013; come to
the university in July for the annual CSU Summer Arts program. The
longtime CSU program relocated to CSUMB in the summer of 2012 for a
five-year run. The program includes a couple of dozen public
events, including lectures, readings, concerts and theatrical
productions &#x2013; in other words, the area&#x2019;s summer arts scene has
gotten a lot more interesting.<br>
&#x2013; Dr. Ilene Feinman</br></br></p>
<p><strong>CSUMB goes green</strong><br>
People across campus are working on many fronts to make Cal State
Monterey Bay a more sustainable university. We developed a Climate
Action Plan that will provide a road map for eliminating greenhouse
gas emissions by 2030 and Issues surrounding sustainability are
addressed in many classes. We&apos;ve also have a robust alternative
transportation program in place. Mike Lerch, CSUMB&apos;s Manager of
Energy and Utilities, can speak to the many energy efficiency
upgrades on campus (that have cut our energy use 20% and reduced
our carbon footprint.<br>
&#x2013; Mike Lerch, CSUMB&#x2019;s associate director of facilities services and
operations&#xA0;</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Art in the service of science</strong><br>
Science illustration is all around us &#x2013; in books, magazines,
posters, on websites, in films and TV, and in museums. Most of us
don&#x2019;t notice the extraordinary technical skill, the precision and
carefully observed detail, or the beauty of these illustrations
because we&#x2019;re busy absorbing information from them. CSUMB is home
to a nationally renowned science illustration program; graduates&#x2019;
work is in the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of
Natural History; in top science magazines such as National
Geographic, Scientific American, Nature and Audubon; at the
National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and the Monterey Bay
Aquarium.<br>
&#x2013; Jenny Keller</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Athletics at CSUMB</strong><br>
CSUMB is dedicated to building champions, one victory at a time --
in our community, in the classroom and in competition. The
university fields 12 teams competing at the NCAA Division II level.
It has earned a national title in men&#x2019;s golf, and a number of
California Collegiate Athletic Association titles.<br>
&#x2013; Kirby Garry, athletic director&#xA0;</br></br></p>
<p><strong>Master of Social Work program meets local
demand</strong><br>
