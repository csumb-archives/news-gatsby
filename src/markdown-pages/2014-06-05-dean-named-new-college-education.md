since 2010, has been named dean of Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s newly
created College of Education.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Alvarado will begin his new duties July 14.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are pleased that Dr. Alvarado has agreed to lead our College
of Education,&#x201D; said CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa. &#x201C;The position
attracted a strong field of candidates. However, the breadth of his
experience and his vision of the role the college could play, both
within the university and in reaching out to the larger community,
helped Dr. Alvarado emerge as the clear choice of the search
committee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As part of the academic reorganization of the university that
goes into effect July 1, the College of Education and the College
of Health Sciences and Human Services were created from programs
that were previously housed in the College of Professional
Studies.<br>
<br>
As associate dean at SDSU, Dr. Alvarado was responsible for the
college budget, personnel issues, college governance, university
relations, academic programming, technology security and system
upgrades, and college policy.</br></br></p>
<p>He said that serving in this administrative capacity
strengthened his commitment to equity, social justice, research,
preparing tomorrow&#x2019;s education professionals, and building strong
partnerships with K-12 schools.</p>
<p>Prior to joining SDSU, Dr. Alvarado worked as a behavior
specialist for a county mental health day treatment program, taught
in an elementary special education classroom, worked in program
implementation for a regional special education office and served
as an on-call crisis counselor.</p>
<p>His research is focused on effective personnel preparation,
implementing efforts to close the achievement gap, effective
instruction, multicultural education, and behavior support for
culturally and linguistically diverse students with
disabilities.</p>
<p>He has published in journals such as &#x201C;Multicultural
Perspectives,&#x201D; &#x201C;Remedial and Special Education, Behavioral
Disorders,&#x201D; &#x201C;Rural Special Education Quarterly,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Assessment
for Effective Intervention.&#x201D; Dr. Alvarado has also been principal
investigator and co-principal investigator for more than $2.5
million in projects funded by the U.S. Department of Education and
the University of South Florida.</p>
<p>Dr. Alvarado earned his bachelor&#x2019;s degree in psychology and
master&#x2019;s in special education from San Diego State University and
his Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.<br>
