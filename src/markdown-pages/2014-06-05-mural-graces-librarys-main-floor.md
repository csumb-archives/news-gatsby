<p>CSU Monterey Bay has recently added to its collection of
historically significant works of art.</p>
<p><img alt="A portion of mural by Dean Cornwell" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/detail_shot_of_mural_for_web.jpg" style="width:400px; height:275px; float:right">&#x201C;The Pageant of
Transportation in California,&#x201D; a sweeping depiction of
industrialization in the state, was installed in the library in May
as a long-term loan from the Monterey Museum of Art.</img></p>
<p>The mural, by Dean Cornwell, includes images of Spanish
colonization, pioneers crossing the desert in covered wagons,
construction of the railroad and an urban environment.</p>
<p>According to a story in the Monterey Herald in April 2012, the
mural has &#x201C;a shape designed to fit a peaked roof and a hole cut in
the center for a ticket booth.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="The mural as it is displayed in the library" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/photo_1.jpg" style="width:400px; height:300px; float:left">Dr. Lila Staples,
chair of the Visual and Public Art Department and a member of the
university&#x2019;s art committee, was instrumental in bringing it to
campus.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy to have it on loan from the Monterey Museum of Art
for several reasons&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It fits with our pride of place. It
fits in with our already acquired murals, and it works seamlessly
with our art department&#x2019;s vision of art as a social process,&#x201D; she
said.</p>
<p>Dr. Staples pointed out that, given its subject matter, the
mural also offers an excellent opportunity for discussion about
changing social values and perspectives.</p>
<p>Library director Bill Robnett; Dr. Ilene Feinman, dean of the
College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; the University Art
Committee; and Kathleen Ventimiglia, director for Campus Planning
and Development, facilitated the acquisition.</p>
<p>It is the fourth major piece acquired by the university.</p>
<p>In 2002, CSUMB officially accepted as permanent loans from the
U.S. Army two murals that grace the walls of the University
Center:</p>
<p>&#x2022; &#x201C;Point Lobos,&#x201D; a piece by Alison Stilwell Cameron (1921-1991)
that was once displayed in Stilwell Hall on the former Fort Ord.
The piece, painted in 1942 as part of a Works Progress
Administration project, depicts the cypress trees of Point Lobos
State Reserve overlooking Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>&#x2022; &#x201C;Los Californios,&#x201D; a mural by Merlin Hardy (1910-1984). Hardy
also painted for the WPA.</p>

university acquired &#x201C;<a href="http://library.csumb.edu/incoming-tide-chiura-obata" rel="nofollow">Incoming Tide</a>,&#x201D; a mural by well-known
Japanese-American artist Chiura Obata (1885-1975) that hangs on a
wall in the library atrium. Painted in 1948 for a Japanese
restaurant in the Monterey area, &#x201C;Incoming Tide&#x201D; (pictured at
right) is an image of Point Lobos.&#xA0;</img></p>
