&#x201C;I know I made the right decision coming to CSUMB,&#x201D; said Lilyana
Gross. &#x201C;The school and the faculty have gotten me where I am
today.&#x201D;</br></p>
<p><img alt="Lilyana Gross" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/lilyanagross.jpeg" style="width:300px; height:407px; float:left">That would be
Harvard, where she is spending the summer at the School of Public
Health&#x2019;s Department of Biostatistics, taking classes in
epidemiology and working on statistical methods used in HIV/AIDS
research.</img></p>
<p>Gross, a senior from Oceanside, spent last summer at North
Carolina State University, conducting research on the spread of
illicit drugs by modeling methamphetamine use as a disease moving
through the population.<br>
<br>
Both placements came through CSUMB&#x2019;s Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Center or UROC, where she is a McNair Scholar. She&#x2019;s
quick to point out that the mentorship she has received through
UROC has been critical to her success.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;My mentor, Dr. Judith Canner, and other faculty at UROC have
taught me that I have the strength, ability and capacity to attain
my career and academic goals,&#x201D; she said.<br>
<br>
Those goals include entering a doctoral program in mathematics and
statistics with applications to biology and public health. Her
career goals are to become a university faculty member, conduct
biostatistics research and mentor students.<br>
<br>
Volleyball brought her to CSUMB. &#x201C;I was recruited to play for the
Otters. Though I had a handful of schools recruiting me, I
committed to CSUMB because of the fantastic biology program,&#x201D; she
said. The university&#x2019;s proximity to the beach didn&#x2019;t hurt, and she
also liked the &#x201C;culture emphasizing the empowerment of
first-generation, low-income students.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Her switch to math came about &#x201C;serendipitously,&#x201D; she said, when
two things happened: she realized she enjoyed the math component of
her science classes, and &#x201C;Professor Heath Proskin&#x2019;s enthusiasm in
multivariate calculus inspired me,&quot; she said.&#xA0;</p>
