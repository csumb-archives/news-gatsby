<p>Rising to the north of campus is a four-story student housing
project, set to open in the fall of 2015.</p>
<p>As the student population at CSU Monterey Bay grows, so does the
need for housing. When the project, called the Promontory at CSUMB,
comes online, it will provide nearly 600 beds configured in 176
units in three buildings. While a final decision has yet to be
made, it is likely the Promontory will house juniors and seniors,
much like the North Quad complex.</p>
<p>The eight-acre site is located at Eighth Street between Fifth
and Sixth avenues, a short walk to the main campus. A maintenance
shop used by the military for small arms and vehicle repair
occupied the site and was demolished as part of the project.</p>
<p>AMCAL Equities of Agoura Hills, the developer, describes the
design as &#x201C;a modern exterior with varied materials and prominent
corners.&#x201D; Plans are not yet finalized for how the public spaces
will be used, but they may include a fitness center, a community
room, a landscaped courtyard, barbecue areas and bicycle storage. A
parking lot for 400 cars is also included.</p>
