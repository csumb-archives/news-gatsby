<p>At an informal gathering on June 12, CSU Monterey Bay staff
members were joined by representatives of the architect and
contractor to sign a beam that will be used in construction of the
Business and Information Technology building.<br>
<br>

covered in white material to accommodate the signatures. It will be
used in a &#x201C;topping off&#x201D; ceremony, an event that marks the placement
of the highest beam in the building, tentatively scheduled for June
20.<br>
<br>
The $43 million, 58,000-square-foot structure is on schedule to
open in the fall of 2015. The technology-rich building, located
next to the Tanimura &amp; Antle library, will have eight
classrooms, 12 labs, offices, conference rooms and student study
areas.<br>
<br>
Sustainability strategies are incorporated into the design. Spaces
are organized to ensure learning environments and staff areas
receive natural light; storm water runoff will be contained on
site; water conserving plumbing fixtures will be used; and
heat-producing direct sunlight kept to a minimum with the exterior
screen wall. The building has been designed to LEED Gold
standards.<br>
