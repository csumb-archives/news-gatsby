<h3>UROCers fan out across the country for research
experiences</h3>
<p>For some college students, summer is a time to put the books
away for a few months and kick back.<br>
<br>

several dozen CSU Monterey Bay students involved with the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center or UROC. Those students
are spending their summers conducting experiments, gathering data
and summarizing their findings in research papers.<br>
<br>
They are spread out across the United States and beyond. Many are
working in labs on other university campuses and at research
centers, and some are working on projects based at CSUMB. One is
doing an ethnographic study in Leon, Spain.<br>
<br>
And while most are majoring in a field of science, a dozen are
pursuing degrees &#x2013; and research topics &#x2013; in math, psychology,
kinesiology, human communication, global studies and social and
behavioral sciences.<br>
<br>
