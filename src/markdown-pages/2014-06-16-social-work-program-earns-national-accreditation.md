<p>California State University, Monterey Bay&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s degree in
social work (MSW) program passed an extensive accreditation process
recently, and is now nationally accredited.</p>
<p>Last fall, CSUMB played host to the fourth site visitor over the
past four years from the Council of&#xA0;<img alt="Social work logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/msw_0.jpg" style="width:350px; height:140px; float:left">Social Work
Education (CSWE). Each met with administrators, faculty, students,
and community advisory board members on campus, poring over the
school&#x2019;s programs, reviewing benchmark documents, and making
suggestions for program improvement. The program submitted its
final three-volume, 1,000-page report on April 1.</img></p>
<p>The visit was the culmination of four years of preparatory work
by CSUMB faculty and staff. Evaluators recently issued their
report, granting initial accreditation through February, 2018.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CSWE accreditation recognizes the professionalism, competence
and quality work put forth by our faculty and staff, as well as the
quality of our students&#x2019; experiences in the field with our
community partner agencies,&#x201D; said Dr. James Raines, interim MSW
program director. &#x201C;It shows that our faculty are well-qualified and
experienced in their fields, that our community partners provide
outstanding support for our students, and that our program does a
great job preparing future social workers based upon national
standards.&#x201D;</p>
<p>To meet CSWE standards, universities must offer intellectually
rigorous standards-based programs relevant to the needs of the
community. To the students, it means that they are now eligible for
national and state scholarship programs and federal loan
forgiveness programs. To the public, accreditation means that the
school underwent rigorous review by an external group of
professionals, and that programs meet standards set by the field at
large.</p>
<p>&quot;National accreditation causes you to continually assess your
programs and constantly seek to improve,&quot; Dr. Raines said of the
process. The university will go through the process again in four
years when formal accreditation expires, but the university will
also submit reports to CSWE along the way.</p>
<p>The MSW program at CSUMB started in 2010. The three-year program
offers evening classes for working adults. In addition to classes,
students must complete 16 hours a week of field experience during
the second and third years of study.</p>
