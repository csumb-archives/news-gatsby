<p>CSU Monterey Bay faculty member Lisa Stewart is taking her
research on work-family issues to a national stage.</p>

teaches in the master of social work program, will take part in the
White House Summit on Working Families in Washington, D.C., on June
23.<br>
<br>
The goal of the summit is to bring business leaders and policy
makers, work-family advocates and scholars together to build a
national strategy to support working families.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I was invited because my research focuses on the challenges
employees with disability-related caregiving face when they combine
that with paid employment,&#x201D; Dr. Stewart said via email, as she was
en route to a professional conference in New York.</br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>Those challenges include maintaining employment, attaining a
career trajectory and income security, she said.<br>
<br>
Dr. Stewart examines how caregiving and paid work intersect in
different ways for people taking care of the disabled and those
with typical caregiving experiences, such as caring for young
children.<br>
<br>
Her work put her on the radar of the Institute for Women&#x2019;s Policy
Research; that group invited her to its Paid Family Leave Research
Strategy Summit in 2012. That led to an invitation to the
summit.<br>
<br>
Her work takes on added significance because of demographic shifts
currently under way. &#x201C;There has been a profound increase in the
likelihood that one will be both working and providing
disability-related caregiving for a portion of one&#x2019;s working life,&#x201D;
she said.<br>
<br>
President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President
Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will be in attendance. <a href="http://workingfamiliessummit.org" rel="nofollow">Learn more about
