<h3>Student body presidents gather for annual Panetta Institute
seminar</h3>
<p>Ian Olden of CSU Monterey Bay was one of 28 students who
attended the Panetta Institute for Public Policy&#x2019;s annual Student
Leadership Seminar in June.</p>
<p><img alt="AS President Ian Olden" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/olden.ian_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:300px; height:319px">Olden, a
fourth-year psychology major from Inglewood, clearly has a passion
for leadership. He was elected Associated Students president for
the upcoming school year on a campaign platform of &quot;Building a
Better University.&quot; Last year, he served as AS vice president and
has led the Residential Housing Association on campus.</img></p>
<p>He joined student leaders from throughout the California State
University system as well as Saint Mary&#x2019;s College of California and
Santa Clara University at the eight-day program.</p>
<p>The objectives of the seminar are to teach young men and women
about leadership principles, strategies and practices; to send them
back to their campuses and communities as more effective leaders;
and to encourage them to pursue lives of public service.</p>
<p>At the seminar, &#x201C;You have the opportunity to speak to the former
Secretary of Defense and CIA director,&#x201D; Olden told local TV station
KION, referring to Leon Panetta. &#x201C;There is just no way that is not
really cool.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The week of seminars and exercises concluded June 21, when Olden
and the other participants shared their goals for their home
campuses and reflected on their own definitions of leadership.</p>
<p>For Olden, it was time well spent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You get to learn so much about compromise and legislation and
it gives you insight into that you&#x2019;re doing more than just
<em>talking</em> about making a difference,&#x201D; Olden told KION.
&#x201C;You&#x2019;re learning how to <em>make</em> a difference.&#x201D;<br>
