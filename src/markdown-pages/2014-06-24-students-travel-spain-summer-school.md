<p>A group of CSU Monterey Bay students are spending June in Leon,
Spain. Under the direction of Dr. Juan Jose Gutierrez, they are
collecting and analyzing data, and getting service learning
experience.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Gutierrez and students in the ethnographic research summer school" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/juan_students.jpg" style="width:370px; height:234px; float:left">Brianna Skinner,
Maria Andrea Cervantes, Yocelin Ruiz, Reyna Flores, Karina Gomez,
Maria Rivera, Guddi Ramsaran, Llaritza Rodriguez and Susan Dyar are
taking part in the ethnographic field research summer school
sponsored by the Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies
and CSUMB&#x2019;s Office of International Programs.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Being drawn into a foreign culture the way we are in this
program is the best way to learn about the history, local
architecture, nature and dreams of other people,&#x201D; Ruiz said.</p>
<p>During their stay, the students learn and apply basic methods of
ethnographic data collection to gain a deeper understanding of the
life and customs of rural communities in the province of Leon.
Using techniques such as mapping, interviewing, genealogical
studies and observation, students explore the past and present of
these communities, which are still struggling with the collapse of
the local mining industry and the downturn of the Spanish
economy.</p>

welcoming &#x2013; not at first, as they seem to have a hard time opening
up, but then they are helpful and welcoming,&#x201D; Rivera said.</img></p>
<p>As for the service learning part of their stay, the students are
helping the local chapter of the Red Cross in a variety of ways.
Visiting villages to check the monitoring system the Red Cross has
installed in the homes of senior citizens is their most important
contribution. Dr. Gutierrez explained that because of the
depopulation of the area, the Red Cross provides support for older
people living on their own.</p>
<p>&#x201C;. . . I particularly like the house visits with the elderly
people of the communities to check the communication devices the
Red Cross has installed in their homes,&#x201D; Flores said. &#x201C;The last
time I went the couple we visited invited us to sit down, learn
about the history of the community and see the things they have
preserved from long ago.&#x201D;</p>

<p class="small">Student Susan Dyar notes on the group&apos;s Facebook
page that she was able to find vegan-friendly food. &quot;They even have
artichokes that rival the Central Coast of California,&quot; she said in
her post.</p>
