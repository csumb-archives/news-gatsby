<p>CSU Monterey Bay President Eduardo Ochoa has joined more than
200 college and university leaders from 33 states in a new
coalition, <a href="http://www.higheredforhigherstandards.org" rel="nofollow">Higher Ed for Higher Standards</a>, to mobilize in
support of the Common Core State Standards.</p>
<p><img alt="Higher Ed for Higher Standards logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/higher_ed.jpg" style="width:240px; height:100px; float:left">Postsecondary
leaders view the Common Core standards, with their focus on career
and college readiness, as critical for improving student
success.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;At Cal State Monterey Bay, we are committed to working
collaboratively with local schools to help improve student
performance. We want more of our young people to graduate from high
school with the academic tools they will need to pursue a college
degree,&#x201D; President Ochoa said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Common Core standards represent an important part of that
effort, and we support them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Higher Ed for Higher Standards believes the Common Core
standards can help colleges and universities in their efforts to
reduce remediation rates and improve student success.</p>
<p>The Higher Ed for Higher Standards coalition is based on three
principles:</p>
<p>1. Every state should insist on K-12 academic standards that
adequately prepare students for college and careers so that every
young person has the opportunity to pursue postsecondary education,
or quality training and careers, after high school. The Common Core
State Standards were developed by states to serve this goal and
represent a significant improvement over most states&#x2019; previous
standards.</p>
<p>2. New assessments aligned to the Common Core standards are
equally critical. States&#x2019; current high school tests do not
adequately measure whether students have mastered the new, higher
standards. More sophisticated assessment instruments are necessary
to provide better feedback to teachers, parents and students, and
offer more meaningful information to colleges on students&#x2019;
postsecondary preparation.</p>
<p>3. Higher education has a clear and compelling stake in this
debate. Effective implementation of the Common Core standards and
aligned assessments is an important step toward improving college
readiness, reducing remediation rates and improving completion
rates in two- and four-year institutions and job-training
programs.</p>
