<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received a $2.1
million federal grant aimed at enrolling more migrant students in
higher education.</p>
<p><img alt="CAMP logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/camp_image_0.jpg" style="width:300px; height:331px; float:right">The five-year
grant, awarded by the U.S Department of Education, will enable
CSUMB to offer financial assistance, academic and career services,
cultural and social enrichment and health and counseling services
through the College Assistance Migrant Program or CAMP.</img></p>
<p>The goal of the program is to create a paradigm shift in the
minds of students and their parents, to help them believe that
college is possible, and to provide the support they need to
succeed once they arrive on campus.</p>
<p>The grant will start in July and run through June of 2019. It
will provide services and assistance for 55 migrant students from
Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara counties.</p>
<p>Services provided by the CAMP grant will also include parent
orientations, high school and community outreach events, admissions
and financial aid application workshops, one-week summer
orientation programs and tutoring.</p>
<p>An estimated 31,000 migrant students live in the four-county
area served by the grant, making the Central Coast home to 25
percent of migrant students in California. In Monterey County, the
average farm worker has an annual income of $18,397.<br>
