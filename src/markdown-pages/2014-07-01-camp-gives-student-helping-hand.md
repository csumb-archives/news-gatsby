<p>Ashley Rojas was nervous about attending college and scared of
failing.</p>

College Assistance Migrant Program, she was able to get over her
fears and get the support she needed to succeed.</img></p>
<p>Ashley was the first in her family to attend college. The
graduate of King City High School decided to enroll in CSUMB in the
fall of 2009.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t count the times I had &#x2018;impostor syndrome,&#x2019; &#x201D; she said.
&#x201C;Failure was constantly in the back of my mind.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ashley was recruited for the CAMP program before her freshman
year. Like all CAMP students, she had access to tutoring, career
exploration, cultural and social activities and follow-up support
services through graduation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;CAMP was one of the programs that was the foudation and
fundamental to my success at CSUMB,&#x201D; she said. She then ticked off
the kinds of support she received:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Summer Bridge &#x2013; &#x201C;Helped with my transition to college&#x201D;<br>
&#x2022; Math 98/99 workshop &#x2013; &#x201C;Saved my life!&#x201D;<br>
&#x2022; &#x201C;An open door whenever I had questions or needed help&#x201D;</br></br></p>
<p>While in the program, she was selected to attend a conference in
Washington, D.C. Two years later, that led to an internship in the
nation&#x2019;s capital.</p>
<p>CSUMB has recently received a <a href="../../jun/26/camp-grant-helps-migrant-students-attain-college-dream.html" rel="nofollow">$2.1 million grant</a> from the U.S. Department of
Education to offer the program for five more years, serving 55
incoming students each year from Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito
and Santa Clara counties.</p>
<p>First-generation college students face many hurdles. Among them
are parents with no college experience, low family incomes,
inadequate academic preparation and language barriers.</p>
<p>The goal of the program is to create a paradigm shift in the
minds of students and their parents that college is possible, and
to provide the support they need to succeed once they arrive on
campus.</p>
<p>It worked for Ashley &#x2013; she graduated in 2014 with a degree in
collaborative health and human services and plans to attend
graduate school after taking a year off. She&#x2019;s hoping to use that
year to teach English in South Korea.</p>
