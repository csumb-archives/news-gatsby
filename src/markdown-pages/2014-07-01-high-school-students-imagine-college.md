<h3>. . . and qualify for a scholarship to help pay for it</h3>

groups of aspiring filmmakers could be seen around campus. They
aren&#x2019;t college students &#x2013; not yet anyway. The filmmakers are part
of Imagine College, a program that allows high school students to
get a taste of what college is all about.</img></p>
<p>The program brings about 180 students from Seaside High to
campus for a trio of one-week sessions. They choose when they will
attend based on which subject they want to study: creative writing
was offered in weeks 1 and 2; filmmaking was offered in weeks 2 and
3; kinesiology was available in week 1; and social action was a
choice in week 3.</p>
<p>In addition, 65 students from North Monterey County High and the
Monterey Peninsula Unified&#xA0;<img alt="Students learn about blood pressure in a kinesiology class" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/kinesiology_for_web.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:179px">School District
attended all three weeks, studying algebra in order to &#x201C;get a boost
for the upcoming school year,&#x201D; said Carol Lenters, director of the
program.</img></p>
<p>According to Juan Ramirez, a program coordinator, the focus of
the program is to get high school students &#x201C;to imagine going to
college, and realize they actually can.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s a powerful message,
since nearly 70 percent of them come from families where no one has
attended college.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the program is the guarantee of a $4,000
scholarship to any student who graduates from Seaside High with a
2.5 grade-point average, attends two weeks of Imagine College while
in high school and gets accepted to a college or university. A
local resident donated the scholarship money.</p>

scholarship is a big draw, Ramirez said the program is also popular
because there&#x2019;s not much for teens to do during the summer. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
one of only a few programs, and the only one with college
professors teaching it,&#x201D; he said.</img></p>
<p class="small">During their week on campus, the students also
visit the Watershed Institute, talk with staff members from the
campus Cross Cultural Center, make and launch small rockets, learn
professional etiquette, and hear from a panel of CSUMB students
about their experience with college.<br>
