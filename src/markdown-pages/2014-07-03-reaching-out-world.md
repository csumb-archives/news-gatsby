<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s reach extends far beyond California&#x2019;s Central
Coast. About 100 students from other nations attend CSUMB each year
for a semester or two, and at least that many CSUMB students travel
abroad.</p>

of international students come to campus each year to study English
through an intensive American language and culture program.<br>
<br>
Opportunities for exchange have just expanded with the signing of
an agreement with Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) in
Taiwan.<br>
<br>
Dr. Jyh-tong Teng, a professor of mechanical engineering at the
Taiwanese university, visited CSUMB recently. As part of his visit,
the two universities signed an agreement to promote academic and
student exchange.<br>
<br>
The schools agreed to cooperate on research activities, to share
academic materials and publications, and to exchange faculty
members and students.<br>
<br>
CYCU has 16,000 students in seven college and schools. The Times
Higher Education rankings of universities in Asia lists it among
the top 100 schools, based on teaching, research, knowledge
transfer and international outlook.<br>
