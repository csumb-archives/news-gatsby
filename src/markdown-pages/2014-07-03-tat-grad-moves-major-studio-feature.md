<p>July 11 is the day Planet of the Apes fans have been
anticipating, as &#x201C;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&#x201D; premieres
nationwide.</p>

David Kashevaroff, that opening represents the culmination of about
two years of work, and an important milestone in his successful
career as a film editor.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;It is hard to maintain perspective when you have worked on a
project so long. But it is a great story and a beautiful film. I
think people will really like it,&#x201D; said Kashevaroff, who graduated
from Cal State Monterey Bay with a degree in Teledramatic Arts and
Technology in 2001. He was one of the first wave of TAT grads who
are becoming increasingly prominent in the film business.</p>
<p>As first assistant editor on &#x201C;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,&#x201D;
Kashevaroff was on set for more than 100 days of location shooting,
primarily in New Orleans, but also in Los Angeles and
Vancouver.</p>
<p>Kashevaroff helped take the footage that was shot every day,
organize it and put it together in a preliminary cut for director
Matt Reeves. Studios want editors on-site to make sure that the
production team has all the shots it needs for the final film, and
to avoid the expense of having to go back to reshoot any
scenes.</p>
<p><img alt="The new Apes film opens July 11" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/apes_promo_photo.jpg" style="width:300px; height:421px; float:right">Adding to the
complexity of this project was the use of motion capture. The movie
doesn&#x2019;t use real apes. Instead, actors&apos; movements are recorded
through computer technology and that information is used to create
lifelike animated characters.</img></p>
<p>Assembling all this into a movie takes time. Kashevaroff said
the director worked with the editors for 15 months after the
footage was shot to come up with the finished product. Deadlines
loomed. They saw the final film on June 21, less than three weeks
before its scheduled opening.</p>
<p>While the previews and commercials for the movie seem to
emphasize its action aspects, Kashevaroff said that is not the
whole story.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It has some action scenes, and in the previews, they are trying
to reach a certain demographic. But the director really comes at
this from an emotional place. It is an epic tragedy in a way,&#x201D; he
said.</p>
<p>For Kashevaroff, the movie represents an opportunity to broaden
his portfolio.&#xA0;Previously, he has worked as an editor on
smaller film projects, including the Oscar-winning documentary
short &#x201C;A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin,&#x201D; as well
as a number of reality television shows, including &#x201C;Top Chef&#x201D; and
&#x201C;Project Runway.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hadn&#x2019;t done a major studio feature before. Sometimes it can
be hard to cross that bridge,&#x201D; Kashevaroff said. &#x201C;But really, I
think the skills to put different sorts of projects together are
very similar. I would hope this would make it easier for me to go
back and forth between reality projects and feature films.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For now, though, he is taking a hard-earned vacation and doesn&#x2019;t
have his next job lined up.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t looked</p>
