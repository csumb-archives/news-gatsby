<p>CSU Monterey Bay alumna Erika D&#x2019;Auria has turned her capstone
project into an exhibit at the Monterey Museum of Art.</p>
<p>D&#x2019;Auria (VPA 2014) is the guest curator of <em>Define:/self/ &#x2013;
Exploring Female Identity</em>, which opens July 11 at the museum&#x2019;s
Pacific Street location.</p>

showcases the work of 20 female artists from the Youth Arts
Collective, a Monterey-based artists&apos; studio for 14- to
22-year-olds. They responded to the prompt, &#x201C;What does it mean to
be a female artist,&#x201D; creating a multi-media exhibition. The work
explores the idea of womanhood, self-identity and how the artists
choose to define themselves.</img></p>
<p>Photographs of the artists accompany their work.</p>
<p>D&#x2019;Auria interviewed each artist, asking her if she thought
females are at a disadvantage being a woman in a man&#x2019;s art
world.</p>
<p>D&#x2019;Auria told the Monterey Herald that the young artists felt
they might not have the same opportunities. But, she said, &#x201C;They
are realistic about their futures. It&#x2019;s not a deterrent but a
motivator.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The VPA graduate told the Herald that she was inspired to create
the show in part because of her sisters, ages 9 and 10.</p>
<p>The exhibit will be on display through July 21. The museum is
located at 559 Pacific St., Monterey. <a href="http://www.montereyart.org" rel="nofollow">Find more information
