open to member colleges, universities, independent schools and
nonprofits around the world.</img></p>

The CASE awards &#x201C;acknowledge superior accomplishments that have
lasting impact and demonstrate the highest level of
professionalism. Winning programs epitomize the profession&#x2019;s best
practices and raise standards,&#x201D; according to the organization&apos;s
website.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Doing What Matters,&#x201D; a documentary produced by Mac and Ava Motion
Pictures of Monterey, was awarded a silver medal in the &#x201C;long
video&#x201D; category. Duke University won the gold medal while Oregon
State finished third among 34 entries in the category.<br>
<br>
The video is an offshoot of the &quot;Doing What Matters&quot; advertising
campaign launched by University Communications in 2013. Both
highlight work the university, its students and faculty have done
that matters to the region and beyond.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Doing What Matters&#x201D; picks up where the 10-year anniversary video,
&#x201C;Bayonets to Baccalaureates&#x201D; &#x2013; also produced by Mac and Ava &#x2013; left
off. That piece told the story of CSUMB&#x2019;s founding after the
decommissioning of Fort Ord. The new video looks forward to the
future and discusses President Ochoa&apos;s view of where the university
is headed in the next decade.<br>
