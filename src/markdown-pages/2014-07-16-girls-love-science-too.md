<p>Girls interested in pursuing a career in marine science are
exploring their options this week through a program at CSU Monterey
Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="24 teenage girls are learning about careers in marine science at Camp SEA Lab" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/csl-summer-camp-tcres04.jpg" style="width:300px; height:400px; float:right">Girls Love Science
Too, a program offered by Camp SEA Lab &#x2013; SEA stands for science,
education, adventure &#x2013; is giving two dozen 13- to 16-year-olds a
chance to learn about marine habitat science and have fun in the
process.</img></p>
<p>The students are housed in residence halls at CSUMB. Their days
get off to an early start with tide pool monitoring at various
locations around the Monterey Peninsula. On Monday, they went out
on the bay in the university&#x2019;s seafloor mapping vessel, the Harold
Heath, to learn about underwater habitat surveying.</p>
<p>Other activities include a trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute in Moss Landing and a visit to the Institute for
Applied Marine Ecology lab on campus. They will also go kayaking
along the coast, and will complete a marine conservation project
based on lessons learned during the week.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s amazing. You go out in the morning and you really feel
like you&#x2019;re an actual scientist,&#x201D; Ally Tomlinson, 14, of
Chowchilla, told KION news. &#x201C;You go and look at all the tide pools
and all the different animals.&#x201D; Her favorite part? Exploring the
different organisms and algae.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All of these activities are intended to educate and inspire
women in STEM careers&#x201D; said Amity Wood, the program manager.</p>
<p>This year, Camp SEA Lab partnered with an organization called
Wishbone.org, which helps underserved students participate in
programs such as Camp SEA Lab through crowd-source funding.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We offered scholarships for four Wishbone students who are
attending this week,&#x201D; Wood said.</p>
