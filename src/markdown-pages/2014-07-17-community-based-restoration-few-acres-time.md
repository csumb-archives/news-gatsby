<p>Rose Ashbach, a graduate student in the Applied Marine and
Watershed Science program at CSU&#xA0;Monterey Bay, has left her
mark on the campus while helping the university implement its
master plan.</p>
<p><img alt="Volunteers helped to restore three acres at the south end of campus" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/volunteers_working_for_web.jpg" style="float:left; width:400px; height:199px">For her senior
thesis, she developed a Habitat Management Plan for 109 acres of
open space located south of the library. Months later, Ashbach was
hired to implement her plan for three of those acres along the
southern border of the campus, at the corner of Lightfighter Drive
and Colonel Durham Street.<br>
<br>
She used a community-based restoration approach that tied together
CSUMB classes, volunteers, the Watershed Institute and her
experience working at the Bureau of Land Management.<br>
Community events were organized where volunteers planted and
watered 2,000 seedlings.<br>
<br>

staff, faculty, university students and community members &#x2013; also
created a half-mile nature trail through the area, removed invasive
species and collected seeds that were then grown at the Watershed
Institute and later planted on the site.<br>
<br>
Students in a service learning class created signs for the area.
One advertised the restoration efforts; the other was an
interpretive sign that describes the process and explains how
people can get involved in community-based habitat
restoration.<br>
<br>
The project &#x201C;has been a great way to build partnerships with local
community members and organizations,&#x201D; Ashbach said. &#x201C;It has created
opportunities for students to leave their legacy on campus, and has
provided service opportunities for students to connect with the
campus open space habitats, native flora and fauna and the local
community.&#x201D;</br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>The project helped the campus implement another master plan
principal which calls for integrating &#x201C;natural and green spaces
into the framework for development&#x201D; and to &#x201C;enhance outdoor
learning, social interaction, recreation and the overall campus
ambiance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Said Anya Spear, associate director of Campus Planning: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m
impressed by the variety and color of plants that are now growing
on a site previously dominated by ice plant. So many of the newly
planted natives are doing well even during such a dry year; this is
what is supposed to be growing here.&#x201D;<br>
