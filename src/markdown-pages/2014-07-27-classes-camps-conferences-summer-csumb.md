<p><img alt="Campus quad in the early morning on a summer day" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/campus_quad_in_early_morning.jpg" style="width:350px; height:200px; float:left">Especially on foggy
days, visitors can be excused for thinking that CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
campus is quiet during the summer. But don&#x2019;t let the outward
appearance fool you &#x2013; there&#x2019;s really a lot going on.</img></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.calstate.edu/summerarts/" rel="nofollow">CSU Summer Arts</a> returns to campus with a lineup of
16 classes and dozens of public events.</p>
<p>Well-known artists, actors, musicians, filmmakers, writers and
dancers will conduct intensive two-week workshops during a pair of
sessions in July. Approximately 400 students have registered for
the classes; in addition, dozens of public performances and events
will be held during the month. For a schedule, click <a href="http://blogs.calstate.edu/summerarts/index.php/events/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>And, as usual during the summer, conferences, teacher training
programs, Upward Bound and other outreach activities for youngsters
and high school students, reading camps, <a href="http://otterathletics.com/sports/2007/8/7/campsstaff.aspx?tab=ottersportscamps" rel="nofollow">sports camps</a>, <a href="http://otterathletics.com/sports/2011/4/6/Aquatics%20Activities.aspx?id=240" rel="nofollow">swimming lessons</a> . . . even <a href="http://schedule.csumb.edu/summer2014/extended#BIO_347_30" rel="nofollow">university classes</a> &#x2013; are all here.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://seasidehigh.mpusd.k12.ca.us/imaginecollege" rel="nofollow">Imagine College Summer Scholar Institute</a>, a
grant-funded program for students from Monterey, Seaside and Marina
high schools, returns for its sixth year at CSUMB. Three weeklong
sessions will be held in June; attendees can choose to take classes
in kinesiology, creative writing, filmmaking or social justice.</p>
<p>Other high school students are attending a summer math academy,
where they take algebra classes part of the day and participate in
leadership development activities. About 120 students are on campus
in these two programs alone.</p>
<p>Teachers will also be here during the summer, attending their
own &#x201C;camp.&#x201D; The Pacific Advanced Placement Institute will hold its
annual summer program at CSUMB for the fourth straight year. More
than 350 high school teachers will share best practices in teaching
advanced placement classes in art history, biology, calculus,
Chinese, Japanese, physics, studio art and other courses.</p>
<p>The sports-minded set &#x2013; from third graders to high school
seniors &#x2013; will be on campus attending baseball, softball,
volleyball, basketball, water polo and soccer camps. Swimming
lessons are also available at the university&#x2019;s aquatics center.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://readingcenter.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Center for Reading Diagnosis and Instruction</a> will
offer a camp of another kind. A weeklong reading camp will be held
in late July for kindergartners through eighth-graders. And the
center is offering summer tutoring sessions throughout June and
July.<br>
<br>
Girls, Inc., an organization that encourages healthy, smart choices
in food and life, will be on campus for a week in mid-June.<br>
<br>
Upward Bound will host 90 high school students for six weeks in
June and July. The students will take college-level classes, learn
about the college application process, and spend a week visiting
other college campuses.<br>
<br>
The younger set &#x2013; more than 250 fourth- through eighth-graders &#x2013;
will be on campus during July to participate in the Junior Otter
program. The migrant students take language arts and math classes
and work with staff members from El Teatro Campesino.<br>
<br>
University students also come to campus over the summer. <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/new-student-otter-orientation" rel="nofollow">New-student orientation</a> for freshmen and transfer
students will bring hundreds of students and their parents to
campus June 13 through 23.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>Also serving university students is the Panetta Institute for
Public Policy&#x2019;s annual weeklong <a href="http://www.panettainstitute.org/programs/study-with-us/student-leadership-training/" rel="nofollow">leadership seminar</a>. Student body presidents and
other elected student leaders from the 23 California State
University campuses, Dominican University of California, Saint
Mary&#x2019;s College of California and Santa Clara University come to
CSUMB to hone their leadership skills and develop strategies for
addressing campus, community and national problems.</p>
<p>Construction continues on two projects &#x2013; the new home of the
College of Business and the School of Information and Communication
Design, and a student housing complex. Demolition of unused
structures from the university&apos;s days as an Army base is taking
place at several sites around campus.<br>
<br>
By mid-August, it will be time to gear-up for the fall semester,
which will start Aug. 25. Students will move into the residence
halls Aug. 22-24.</br></br></p>
