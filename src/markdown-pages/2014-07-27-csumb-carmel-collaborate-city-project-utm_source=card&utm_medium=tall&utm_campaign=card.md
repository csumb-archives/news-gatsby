<p>A Carmel city councilwoman put out a call for help, and CSU
Monterey Bay faculty, staff and students responded.</p>
<p>For their work in mapping the city&#x2019;s trails using geographic
information systems, the team was honored at a City Council meeting
in early July.</p>

about when Councilwoman Victoria Beach wanted to have an
alternative transportation mapping project done. She contacted
Megan Tolbert, CSUMB&#x2019;s transportation planner. Tolbert knew that
GIS technology was needed, and approached Professor Yong Lao to see
if his students would take on the project.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Lao was eager for the opportunity, and students in his GIS
for social science and business applications class took on the
project last spring.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The students ramped up their GIS know-how and worked to
coordinate with Victoria and her team of 20-plus agencies,&#x201D; Tolbert
said.</p>
<p>The students had an immense task of pulling big data files
together from the various agencies, organizing the data,
researching best practices for the map they were trying to create,
and communicating feasibility and options. The final product was a
map of Carmel&#x2019;s bike and pedestrian routes.</p>
<p>The map will help decision makers see gaps in the system,
allowing them to allocate resources in a way that closes those
gaps. For example, it could help determine where sidewalks need to
be provided.</p>

help the city promote eco-tourism. It needed to know if visitors
who found their way to Carmel would be able to get around the city
without a car.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a base map,&#x201D; Tolbert said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a starting point, and the
hardest part of the project.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Four students worked on the project &#x2013; Cooper Mitchell,
Jacqueline Estrada, Samra Asrat and Michael LePage, who is a member
of the Carmel Planning Commission.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are grateful for the opportunity to connect Carmel and their
collaborating organizations with valuable GIS skills,&#x201D; Tolbert
said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a need for agencies, but many times unfunded.&#x201D;</p>
