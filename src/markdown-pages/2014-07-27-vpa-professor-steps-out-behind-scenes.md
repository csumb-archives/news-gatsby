<p>After more than 35 years of experience behind the scenes as a
lighting designer and visual artist, Stephanie Johnson will perform
her first one-woman show on July 21 as part of the AfroSolo Arts
Festival in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img alt="Stephanie Johnson" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/stephanie_johnson.jpg" style="width:240px; height:360px; float:left">The performance &#x2013;
one of four that evening at the Marsh Theater in San Francisco &#x2013; is
a sneak preview of the festival&#x2019;s Black Voices season. The works in
progress will be shown as fully developed productions in late
September.</img></p>
<p>Professor Johnson will perform <em>Every Twenty Days: Cancer,
Yoga and Me</em>, her personal story about being diagnosed with
cancer in December 2012. The title is a reference to her
chemotherapy treatments, self-healing practices and remembrances of
family and friends who died from the disease.</p>
<p>The festival&#x2019;s website describes it as &#x201C;an intimate, funny and
uplifting story about the journey from diagnosis to treatment to
physical well-being.&#x201D; It represents her first venture into play
writing and solo performance.</p>
<p>Professor Johnson has been a member of the Visual and Public Art
Department faculty since the university opened. She currently
teaches classes in installation and performance, public art and art
history.</p>
<p>She has a B.F.A. from Emerson College, Boston, an M.A. in
Interdisciplinary Studies from San Francisco State University, an
M.F.A. from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. in
public policy from Union Institute and University.<br>
<br>
As an artist, Professor Johnson uses her installations and mixed
media sculptures as a way to preserve and honor the history of
Africans. Her work focuses on the use of two primary elements:
light and archival materials, which include newspaper articles,
photos and found relics. She uses large-scale slide projections in
settings such as railroad stations, churches, cemeteries and
galleries.<br>
<br>
Her work has been exhibited at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts and
the Jewish Museum in San Francisco; the African American Museum in
Dallas; Spellman College Museum of Art in Atlanta; and the Museum
of Fine Arts in Houston, among other venues. She has had one-person
shows at the Center for African American Life and Culture and the
African American Historical Society, both in San Francisco.<br>
