State University, Monterey Bay, 14 new tenure-track professors have
already been hired for the new school year and several more may
join them. The university anticipates it will hire 24 more for the
2015-16 school year.<br>
<br>
The hiring is part of an effort in the CSU system to fill about 700
full-time faculty positions for the upcoming year to accommodate
enrollment growth (approximately 10,000 more students are expected
this year), relieve course bottlenecks and fill posts left vacant
by retiring faculty members.<br>
<br>
Now that the system is getting more funding &#x2013; $142.2 million in
additional money for the upcoming year &#x2013; the CSU has made it a
priority to boost the number of tenure-track professors, according
to CSU spokesman Mike Uhlenkamp.<br>
