<h3>Music students mix it up in recording studio</h3>
<p>When students in CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Music and Performing Arts
Department enrolled in an advanced audio production class in 2013,
they were signing up for the opportunity to work on a real-world
project.</p>
<p><img alt="Recording console in the Music Hall" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/recording_console.png" style="width:242px; height:180px; float:left">Eight students
helped to record an album of experimental music, under the
direction of faculty member Lanier Sammons.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Sammons served as producer of the album, <a href="http://www.giacomofiore.com/#iv-american-electric-guitars" rel="nofollow"><em>iv: American electric guitars</em></a> by Giacomo
Fiore, a collection of four pieces by contemporary American
composers. Dr. Fiore, a former lecturer at CSUMB, was awarded a New
Music USA grant to fund the album&#x2019;s mastering, pressing and
distribution. It will be released digitally and on vinyl on July
31. That night, Dr. Fiori will celebrate the release with a concert
at the Center for New Music in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As producer, my role was to oversee the sessions and work with
Giacomo on content and quality,&#x201D; Dr. Sammons said. &#x201C;The students
served as both recording engineers and mixing engineers. It was
very hands-on for them.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="Part of the setup for the recording sessions" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/from_the_session.jpeg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:400px">The album was
recorded over three sessions in the Music Hall, each lasting about
four hours. Students were behind the console &#x2013; with plenty of
glowing lights &#x2013; and ran the Pro Tools software. They were
responsible for setting and monitoring levels, sound quality and
other technical details. They interacted with the artist as
well.</img></p>
<p>Dr. Sammons estimates that approximately 65 percent of music
majors at CSUMB are in the recording technology concentration. They
start with a class called Music and Computers, then advance through
a series of classes that involve recording and mixing. They also
take traditional music classes &#x2013; in history, theory and
performance. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s still very much a bachelor of arts in music,&#x201D;
Dr. Sammons said.</p>
<p>Math and computer science courses are relevant and helpful, he
said, as well as electronic engineering knowledge. &#x201C;We often talk
about the physics of sounds and go into a little detail about the
inner workings of the gear.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ultimately, however, the music background is usually the most
important for recording engineers.&#x201D;</p>

graduates of the program aim to be engineers in studios. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a
very competitive field, but our alumni seem to be doing well,&#x201D; Dr.
Sammons said.</img></p>
<p><em>The album&#x2019;s liner notes list Collin Atkinson, Bobby
Guinvarch, Zak Coffey, Andrew Hardesty, Drew Lassen, Kevin
Leinhard, Orion Navaille and Rolan Terrazas as engineers. The album
was mixed by Atkinson and Navaille.</em></p>
