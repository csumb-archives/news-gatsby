<p>&#x201C;Combined Destinies: Whites Sharing Grief about Racism,&#x201D; edited
by Ann Todd Jealous and Caroline&#xA0;<img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/combined_destinies_book_jacket.png" style="width:201px; height:295px; float:left">Haskell, was
published about 18 months ago, but continues to draw attention for
its important message.</img></p>
<p>The book is an anthology of highly personal stories written by
53 people &#x2013; all white. It helps the reader to understand racism,
not as individual acts against another person, but as a
&#x201C;self-perpetuating system of advantage based on race . . . power
plus prejudice.&#x201D; It examines how white Americans have been hurt by
the very ideology that their ancestors created.<br>
<br>
It was published in February 2013 by Potomac Books, an imprint of
the University of Nebraska Press, and will be released in paperback
and as an e-book in September.<br>
<br>
Haskell, director of Health and Wellness Services at CSU Monterey
Bay, was invited to give a presentation about it at last week&#x2019;s
National Association of Social Workers conference in Washington,
D.C. The conference theme was Social Work: Courage, Hope and
Leadership.<br>

reviewed in the May edition of the journal Equity and Excellence in
Education. The reviewer, CSUMB founding faculty member Christine
Sleeter, noted that most readers will find stories they identify
with, as well as echoes of their own fears, discomforts, losses and
silences.<br>
<br>
Haskell is a licensed clinical social worker and a board certified
diplomate in clinical social work. She joined CSUMB as founding
director of the Personal Growth and Counseling Center in the
university&apos;s early years.</br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><em>A groundbreaking collection . . . Everyone in society is
hurt by racism, not just those who are its targets. What better way
to teach this profound truth than to allow white people to share
their epiphanies</em>?<br>
