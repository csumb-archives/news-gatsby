<h3>Nationally honored program &#x2018;graduates&#x2019; 180</h3>
<p>&#x201C;Find your heart. Follow your heart and you will find your
destiny,&#x201D; playwright Luis Valdez told a group assembled in the
University Center at CSU Monterey Bay on July 30.</p>
<p>Valdez, founder of El Teatro Campesino and an original faculty
member at CSUMB, spoke to an audience of several hundred
youngsters, their parents and educators.</p>

made at the graduation ceremony of the Migrant Junior Otter
program. A monthlong collaboration among the university, the
Monterey County Office of Education and El Teatro, the program
involves youngsters from migrant families in grades four through
eight from nine local school districts.</img></p>
<p>The youngsters were bused to campus &#x2013; some from as far away as
King City. They received instruction in language arts and math each
morning. Afternoons were devoted to creative activities, including
music, dance and art, taught by staff members of El Teatro. The
youngsters were also introduced to college life and learned what it
takes to be a successful student.</p>
<p>This year there was a stronger emphasis on language development,
said Ernesto Vela, director of Migrant Education Region XVI, which
includes Monterey County.</p>

hand-in-hand with language development,&#x201D; Dr. Vela said. In previous
years, he said, general academic instruction was provided. This
year, &#x201C;we had a strong focus on language.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>After remarks by Valdez and several administrators, the students
showed off their work. The younger ones performed six skits they
wrote themselves; the seventh- and eighth-graders showed videos
they made.</p>
<p>The program, now in its sixth year, was recognized at the 2010
National Migrant Education Conference as an outstanding example of
a collaborative effort. In 2012, it was selected for a Golden Bell
Award from the California School Boards Association.</p>
<p>Golden Bell Awards promote excellence in education by
recognizing outstanding programs in school districts and county
offices of education. They reflect the depth and breadth of
education programs necessary to address students&#x2019; changing
needs.</p>
