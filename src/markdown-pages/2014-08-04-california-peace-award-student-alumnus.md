<p>A CSU Monterey student and an alumnus will be recognized by
Assemblyman Luis Alejo as California Peace Award winners for the
30th Assembly District.</p>
<p>Elizabet Zepeda-Gonzalez, a social and behavioral sciences
major, believes that keeping young people involved in their
community is a way to keep the peace.</p>
<p><img alt="Peace Award logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/california-peace-award.jpg" style="float:left; width:200px; height:119px">As a high school
student in Hollister, she got involved with the League of United
Latin American Citizens. Through that work, she has helped to
address the needs of local communities.</img></p>
<p>She believes that peace can take the form of &#x201C;helping a
community member fill out a paper, keeping kids active, showing
them how many opportunities there are that would benefit them,&#x201D; she
told the Monterey Herald.</p>
<p>Paul De Worken, a 2008 graduate with a degree in Visual and
Public Art, has been involved in art projects throughout the Pajaro
Valley for years. He has served on the Watsonville Public Art
Committee, Santa Cruz County Arts Commission, and created the Mural
Alleyway Project to provide art to the Watsonville community.</p>
<p>De Worken believes when children pick up a paint brush instead
of a weapon, the community becomes a healthier one.</p>
<p>The recipients will be honored Aug. 5 during National Night Out,
the annual crime prevention effort that brings together law
enforcement and residents.</p>
<p>Residents of the 30th Assembly District were asked to submit
names of people throughout the area who have made noteworthy
efforts to stop violence and create a safer community.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Each year, the hard work of dozens of individuals is brought to
light,&#x201D; Alejo said in a news release. &#x201C;I respect and value the work
peace promoters invest to make our neighborhoods safer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After reviewing nominations, four candidates were selected based
on their strong track record in promoting peace. Joining
Zepeda-Gonzalez and De Worken are Mario Banuelos of Santa Clara
County and Javier Tamayo of Salinas.</p>
<p><em>The 30th Assembly District includes the Salinas Valley, San
Benito County, south Santa Clara County and the city of
Watsonville.</em><br>
