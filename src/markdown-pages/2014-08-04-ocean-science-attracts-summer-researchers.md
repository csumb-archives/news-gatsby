<p>Many universities offer a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program, but they don&apos;t have what CSU Monterey
Bay has to offer.<br>
<br>
The bay and the National Marine Sanctuary &#x2013; and the research
institutions that surround them &#x2013; are hard to beat for anyone
interested in studying ocean science.</br></br></p>
<p><img alt="REU participants on Monterey Bay" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/taylor_eddy.jpg" style="width:400px; height:300px; float:right">Taylor Eddy, a
senior marine science major from Concord, is the only CSUMB student
among the 11 who are participating this summer in the REU based on
campus. One student is from Hartnell College in Salinas, the other
nine come from all over the country.</img></p>
<p>It is funded by the National Science Foundation as a way of
introducing undergraduates to research while providing
out-of-classroom and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>Dr. Corey Garza, a professor in CSUMB&apos;s Division of Science and
Environmental Policy, is the program director.</p>
<p>Eddy is working at Moss Landing Marine Labs, looking at humpback
whale foraging ground in the Gulf of the Farallones and Monterey
Bay national marine sanctuaries.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Most of my time is spent in the lab, creating maps and
analyzing the data collected from cruises in the sanctuaries,&#x201D; she
said. That involves using ArcGIS and other statistical analysis
software she had to learn this summer.</p>
<p>She also had an opportunity to go on one of those cruises where
whales were tagged. Angela Szesciorka, the graduate student she is
working with, invited her to go out on Half Moon Bay and Bodega Bay
one weekend. Her job was to get photo identification of the
whales.</p>
<p>In addition to the lab work, she meets with her mentor
occasionally and talks with the graduate students about their
work.</p>
<p>When not in the lab, Eddy and the other REU students &#x201C;spend
quite a bit of time together,&#x201D; she said, hiking, scuba diving and
on outings to explore Cannery Row.</p>
<p>Diving was a big part of what drew her to CSUMB. &#x201C;I came because
of the growing marine science program, and I wanted to take up
scuba diving. CSUMB has a great program in an amazing area.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She plans to apply to graduate school in marine ecology and is
looking into internships.<br>
