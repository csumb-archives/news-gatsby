<h3>Algebra Academy gives middle schoolers a head start</h3>
<p>More than 100 incoming eighth-graders will spend the last days
of their summer break immersed in math at the <a href="http://www.algebraacademy.net" rel="nofollow">Bruce W. Woolpert
Algebra Academy</a>, which began Aug. 7 at Graniterock headquarters
in Watsonville.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Hongde Hu" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/hongde_hu_small_2.jpg" style="width:400px; height:274px; float:left">This is the fifth
year Graniterock has opened its doors to provide a fun, safe
environment for students to sharpen their algebra skills with
college professors, including Dr. Hongde Hu of CSU Monterey Bay,
providing instruction.<br>
<br>
Classes are held Aug. 7, 8, 11 and 12 at Graniterock&#x2019;s corporate
office in Watsonville. Students will visit CSU Monterey Bay for a
field trip and additional algebra work on Aug. 13. The academy
graduation ceremony will take place Aug. 14 at the E.A. Hall Middle
School in Watsonville.<br>
<br>
Dr. Hu said his job is to inspire students, to show them they can
crack the mysteries of math. He&#x2019;s quick to add that he&#x2019;s not just
teaching math. &#x201C;We are teaching habits of mind,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I want
to make these students good citizens as well as good
students.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Research examining 24,000 students in two dozen California school
districts found that students already doing well in math in the
seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math courses in high
school and meet college entrance requirements.<br>
<br>
But for many students who struggle with math in grade seven, there
is no clear path to learning and achievement. Dr. Hu uses math
games, engaging presentations and curriculum he has been refining
for years to reach those youngsters.<br>
<br>
Students who fail algebra and repeat the course are likely to fail
again, a vicious cycle that wastes learning time and resources.
That&#x2019;s according to a study that was commissioned by the Center for
the Future of Teaching and Learning at WestEd and released in 2012.
The Sacramento nonprofit focuses on policies and practices to
improve teaching. (<a href="http://www.cftl.org/documents/2012/CFTL_MathPatterns_Main_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Read the WestEd report here.</a>)&#xA0;<br>
<br>
And that reinforces a point Dr. Hu makes every chance he
gets.<br>
<br>
Algebra is &#x201C;the gateway&#x201D; to studies in college, he says. &#x201C;Without
it, there&#x2019;s no way students continue.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Algebra Academy was started in 2010 by Graniterock&#x2019;s former
President and CEO Bruce W. Woolpert and corporate counsel Kevin
Jeffery, who were passionate about the education of local students.
They believed in the importance of students having a strong
foundation in mathematics. Woolpert and Jeffery invited Dr. Hu to
work with students at Watsonville&#x2019;s Rolling Hills Middle School for
the first Algebra Academy, and the program has grown in interest
and impact from those beginnings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>Since the program started, four schools have been added and the
enrollment has doubled from 55 to 110. Field trips to CSUMB and UC
Santa Cruz have been added. Math festivals and math clubs have been
developed at participating schools.<br>
