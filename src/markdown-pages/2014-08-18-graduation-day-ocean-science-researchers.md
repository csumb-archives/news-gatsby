<p><img alt="The 11 members of CSUMB&apos;s first REU" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/reu_final_day.jpg" style="width:550px; height:413px; float:left">For the 11 students
who spent the summer conducting research through the Ocean Science
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program based at CSU
Monterey Bay, Aug. 15 was graduation day.</img></p>
<p>The students &#x2013; one from CSUMB, one from Hartnell College in
Salinas and the other nine from campuses around the country &#x2013;
presented their work to a group of their peers, CSUMB faculty and
administrators, and mentors from the collaborating agencies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is a new adventure for the students, for us and for the
research partners,&#x201D; said Dr. Corey Garza, a professor in CSUMB&#x2019;s
Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the
program.</p>
<p>Dr. Garza referred to the program as a distributed REU model.
&#x201C;We did this in collaboration with five partners, and students
could choose where they wanted to work. It&#x2019;s a new approach for the
National Science Foundation&#x2019;s REUs,&#x201D; he said. The NSF is funding
the program.</p>
<p>Those partners are Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research
Reserve; Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University; Monterey
Bay Aquarium Research Institute; Moss Landing Marine Labs; and the
Naval Postgraduate School. In addition, two students chose to work
at labs on the CSUMB campus.</p>
<p>Among the research topics presented: distribution patterns of
humpback whales; underwater laser &#x201C;tripwire&#x201D; for detecting marine
life; algae blooms in Elkhorn Slough Estuary; and circulation
patterns in the Monterey Bay region from high frequency radar.</p>
