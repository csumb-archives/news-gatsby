<p>Images from the <a href="http://seafloor.otterlabs.org" rel="nofollow">Seafloor Mapping Lab</a> at CSU Monterey Bay have been
put to use by an East Coast artist.&#xA0;</p>
<p><img alt="Margaret Boozer in her studio" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/margaret_boozer.jpg" style="width:300px; height:400px; float:left">Margaret Boozer, a
ceramist and sculptor with a studio in the Washington, D.C., area,
tapped into the lab&#x2019;s website for her work on a commission for a
private residence in San Francisco.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been working on a project using visual information from
the lab as base material for a sculptural translation,&#x201D; she wrote
in an email to SFML director Rikk Kvitek.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I really appreciate having online access to the amazing and
beautiful information from your collaborative project. Thank you
for making it available,&#x201D; Boozer said. Images from the project can
be seen on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/margaret.boozer/media_set?set=a.10204264225470795.1073741854.1382932060&amp;type=3" rel="nofollow">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Kvitek was delighted. &quot;You are realizing a dream that I have
always had, which is for a talented artist to see, interpret and
use in their own work California&apos;s captivatingly beautiful natural
landscape paterns that our seafloor mapping work has brought to
light with sonar,&quot; he wrote to the artist.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am glad to see our efforts are of value to the arts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to her <a href="http://margaretboozer.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>, Boozer&#x2019;s work is included in the collection
of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of the City of
New York, the U.S. Department of State, and in many private
collections. Recent projects include a commissioned installation at
the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti and a chapter she wrote for the U.S.
Geological Survey&#x2019;s Soil and Culture publication. Recent
exhibitions include Swept Away: Dust, Ashes and Dirt at the Museum
of Arts and Design in New York.<br>
