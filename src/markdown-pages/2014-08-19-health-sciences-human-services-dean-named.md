<p>&#x201C;The right leadership can make all the difference in launching a
new college. In Dr. Rios-Ellis, we have been able to attract a
proven academic leader who is a recognized authority in community
health issues, especially as they relate to underserved Latino
populations,&#x201D; said Eduardo Ochoa, president of CSUMB.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We think she will be an outstanding fit for our university and
for our community.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As part of the academic reorganization of the university that
went into effect on July 1, the College of Health Sciences and
Human Services and the College of Education were created from
programs that were previously housed in the College of Professional
Studies.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;I am deeply honored to serve as founding Dean of the College of
Health Sciences and Human Services at California State University
Monterey Bay. I am very excited about working with the excellent
administration, faculty, staff, students, and community as we build
the new college,&#x201D; said Dr. Rios-Ellis.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;I am committed to working collectively with our outstanding
faculty to provide students with the highest level of training as
we develop culturally relevant ways to address the prominent health
disparities in our region and build a strong reputation on the
wealth of expertise we have to offer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For the past 20 years, she has served as a professor at
California State University Long Beach and is also director of the
National Council of La Raza (NCLR)/CSULB Center for Latino
Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training and the newly
inaugurated Centro Salud es Cultura located in downtown Long Beach.
Since founding the Center in 2005, Dr. Rios-Ellis spearheaded over
$50 million in funded student- and community-strengthening research
projects and has been the Co-Principal Investigator on two grants
from the U.S. Department of Education to transform CSULB into a
Hispanic Serving Institution.<br>
<br>
This summer she served as a delegate for the U.S. State
Department&#x2019;s People to People Initiative in Beijing and for the NIH
Office of AIDS Research Hispanic Advisory Group at the
International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. Currently
she is collaborating with the Fundaci&#xF3;n Haciendas del Mundo Maya in
conducting health-related needs assessments of remote Maya
communities in the Yucatan with a focus on obesity and
diabetes.<br>
<br>
In 2013, Dr. Rios-Ellis was awarded the highest honor at CSULB:
