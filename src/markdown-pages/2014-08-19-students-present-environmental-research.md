<p>A contingent of CSU Monterey Bay students and faculty members
will be among those presenting research at the annual meeting of
the <a href="http://www.esa.org/esa/" rel="nofollow">Ecological
Society of America</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="ESA conference logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/logo.gif" style="width:200px; height:167px; float:left">More than 3,000
environmental scientists will attend the meeting in Sacramento,
scheduled for Aug. 10-15. The theme: &#x201C;From oceans to mountains:
It&#x2019;s all ecology.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p><a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/Paper47767.html" rel="nofollow">Miles Daniels</a>, who just graduated with a Master of
Science in Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy, worked with
Professor Fred Watson. They explored ways to protect human and
wildlife health in the Monterey Bay region from waterborne diseases
by using wetlands as a filter. The wetlands filter out dangerous
disease-causing organisms before people and animals come into
contact with them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Overall, our research demonstrated that by improving valuable
wetland habitat in the Monterey Bay, water quality may also be
improved,&#x201D; Daniels said. He will present his work on Aug. 14.</p>
<p>Daniels is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Epidemiology
Department at U.C. Davis. &#x201C;I am combining my background in
environmental science with health sciences to work on research
questions in public, wildlife and environmental health,&#x201D; Daniels
said.</p>
<p><a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/Paper49930.html" rel="nofollow">Stefanie Kortman</a>, a graduate student in Coastal and
Watershed Science and Policy, worked with Professor Marc Los
Huertos on a project involving greenhouse gas emissions from
strawberry farming on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>Agriculture is the main contributor to nitrous oxide emissions,
Kortman explained, and there is much concern on how farm management
practices influence its production. &quot;My research project aimed to
quantify and assess potential differences in nitrous oxide
emissions from organic and conventional strawberry farms in
Monterey Bay,&quot; Kortman said.</p>
<p>She concluded that there was no significant difference between
organic and conventional growing methods.</p>
<p>Kortman will present her work on Aug. 14.</p>
<p><a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/Paper50362.html" rel="nofollow">April Makukhov</a> worked with researchers from Hopkins
Marine Station and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
on a project involving red abalone settlement in Monterey Bay. She
will present her work on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>The senior biology major explained that her research is the
first assessment of abalone settlement in Monterey Bay, which is
important because abalone are key grazers that maintain the kelp
forests. She learned that, despite low densities of adult red
abalone, recruitment of newly settled red abalone has been
consistently high over the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;This is interesting,&quot; she said, &quot;because adult red abalone are
preyed on my sea otters, so future studies can look at the
aggregation of adult abalone to see if the presence of sea otters
is leading to the more successful settlement we have been observing
compared to Northern California.&quot;</p>
<p>Makukhov was recently named a CSU Pre-Doctoral Fellow, and
awarded $3,000. The biology major is working with Professor Cheryl
Logan this summer, investigating the impacts of ocean acidification
on juvenile rockfish.</p>
<p>Scott Blanco, who earned a master&apos;s in applied marine and
watershed science in May, will present his thesis research about
the eological control of toxic algae in Watsonville&apos;s Pinto
Lake.</p>
