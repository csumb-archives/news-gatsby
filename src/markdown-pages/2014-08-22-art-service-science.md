<h3>CSUMB grad tackles the evolution of birds</h3>
<p>Jane Kim seems to like big projects.</p>
<p>A few months ago, after more than three year of development and
painting, the science illustrator completed Migrating Mural: Sierra
Nevada Bighorn Sheep. The project, a series of six murals along the
migrating route of the endangered species, was completed in the
spring when the final touches were put on the northernmost
installation, at the Mono Lake Visitor Center. The murals are
located along a 120-mile stretch of Route 395 in Northern
California.</p>

started a vast project at the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/Page.aspx?pid=1478" rel="nofollow">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a> &#x2013; a mural that will
depict the evolution and diversity of birds.</img></p>
<p>She will paint the history of birds spanning 375 million years.
The mural will include one representative example from every bird
family in the world &#x2013; all 231 of them &#x2013; including several extinct
species.</p>
<p>The project is called &#x201C;From So Simple a Beginning,&#x201D; after
Charles Darwin&#x2019;s famous quotation about evolution and biodiversity.
It will be done as a single mural in the lab&#x2019;s visitor center,
covering 4,000 square feet of wall space &#x2013; Kim&#x2019;s largest canvas
yet. The birds will be painted true-to-size against the silhouette
of the continent where they originated.</p>
<p>According to the lab&#x2019;s website, the mural &#x201C;will provide a visual
journey through epochs of evolutionary development, from fish to
dinosaurs to the present day.&#x201D;</p>

started in August, Kim has spent the last year sketching the birds
on paper. In order to complete the project in time for the lab&#x2019;s
centennial, she will have to paint a bird a day.</img></p>
<p>Kim earned a certificate in science illustration at CSU Monterey
Bay in 2010. After completing classes, she did an internship at the
Cornell lab.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The science illustration program was one of the most important
decisions of my life,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Through the program, I was able
to define what sort of purpose art had for me.&#x201D;</p>

<em>&quot;One of the challenges of our generation and culture is that we
forget that we&#x2019;re a part of nature and the ecosystem. We have all
this technology and live in buildings and big cities. So we easily
forget the natural world. I&#x2019;d like to advocate for the natural
world, to be a voice for it.&quot;</em><br>
