<p>Maritza Bautista&#x2019;s third-grade teacher influenced her career
choice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just as she helped me, I want to return the favor to my
community,&#x201D; said the CalState TEACH student and Salinas resident.
&#x201C;I want to be as committed as she was.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img alt="Maritza Bautista" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/bautista_single_0038.gif" style="width:250px; float:right; height:293px">Bautista, a 2013
graduate of CSU Monterey Bay, has just gotten some help in her
pursuit of a teaching credential, in the form of the John and
Dorothy Perry Scholarship. The $2,000 scholarship honors longtime
public school teacher and administrator John Perry, who spent the
last part of his career with CalState TEACH. Bautista is the first
recipient of the award and was chosen among 12 applicants by a
committee of faculty members.</img></p>
<p>Dorothy Perry created the scholarship to honor her late husband
and to support those who are committed to teaching science
throughout the curriculum.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s exactly what Bautista is doing at Tiburcio Vasquez
Elementary School in Salinas where she completed her clinical
experience and is now teaching while she continues to take online
classes. Her school uses individual iPads for all students and she
has implemented technology with learning activities in a way that
integrates science with reading and math.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If I introduce science with fun activities, then possibly they
will pursue a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math)
career,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>As part of her credential program, Bautista has daily contact
with a site mentor at the school and consults with a supervising
faculty member at the university program. She will complete the
program and earn a multiple subject teaching credential in
December.</p>
<p>CalState TEACH is an online credential program for people who
wish to become teachers but are unable to attend traditional
classes because of their busy schedules or because they live in
remote areas. The program&#x2019;s foundation is self-study with online
materials, e-texts, videos, web-based class discussions and on-site
coaching. The state is served from four regional offices, including
one at CSUMB.</p>
