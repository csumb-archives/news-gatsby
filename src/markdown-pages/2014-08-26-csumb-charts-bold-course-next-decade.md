<h3>President&apos;s annual State of the University address kicks off
new school year</h3>
<p>President <a href="http://president.csumb.edu/biography" rel="nofollow">Eduardo Ochoa</a> delivered an upbeat State of the
University address Aug. 21 at the World Theater as he noted school
achievements as well as plans for the future.</p>

outstanding year for Cal State Monterey Bay,&#x201D; President Ochoa said.
&#x201C;We are growing and playing a more integral role in the life of our
community.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Two decades after the university&#x2019;s founding, CSUMB is in a
position to chart a &#x201C;bold course&#x201D; for the next decade, he said,
referring to enrollment growth, hiring of more tenure-track faculty
members and an expansion of service to the community.</p>
<p>Getting there will require strategic thinking, he noted, but
stressed that the personal connection between students and faculty
needs to be maintained.</p>
<p>The foundation for growth has already been put in place with a
new academic structure and the hiring of a new provost, Bonnie
Irwin. With the creation of the new College of Education and the
College of Health Sciences and Human Services, the university will
be positioned to expand its service to the region.</p>
<p>Among the highlights from last academic year, he noted the
largest graduating class; the President&#x2019;s Speaker Series that
focused on locally relevant issues; a grant to enroll more migrant
students; and honors won by faculty, staff members and
students.</p>
<p>The California drought was mentioned, with the president&#x2019;s
assurance that the university has an adequate water allocation to
sustain its growth plans for the coming years. &#x201C;However,&#x201D; he said,
&#x201C;that does not change our obligation to pursue sustainable policies
in using water and energy, and helping to combat climate
change.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Job creation is another area where the university can have an
impact.</p>
<p class="pullquote">&apos;It is part of our duty as a university to
encourage positive economic and social change in our local
area.&apos;<br>
&#x2013; President Eduardo Ochoa</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Our campus has reached a point where the work of our
researchers and faculty members offers real possibilities for
spinoffs and business partnerships,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We seek to be a hub
for economic innovation,&#x201D; and the development of good jobs.</p>
<p>He talked about the issue of income inequality and how it
relates to the task facing CSUMB. A major aspect of the
university&#x2019;s mission is to educate underserved populations. &#x201C;We
fulfill that promise by educating a diverse student body that
includes a majority of first-generation students,&#x201D; and do it at an
affordable price.</p>
<p>President Ochoa concluded with a reference to the cuts in state
funding that the university has endured in recent years. &#x201C;I
appreciate the efforts by faculty and staff as they have kept the
university moving forward through difficult economic times.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is those efforts that have now placed Cal State Monterey Bay
in a position to take advantage of the great possibilities that lie
ahead.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As the program continued, employee service awards were presented
to 51 people who have been with the university for five years;
10-year pins were awarded to 22 staff members; and 33 others were
acknowledged for 15 years of service. The second and third 20-year
service awards in the university&#x2019;s history went to Wynter Nichols
and Monica Rodriguez.<br>
<br>
Also acknowledged were the faculty members who had been granted
tenure and promoted to associate professor.<br>
