<p>CSU Monterey Bay Professor <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/staff/cheryl/cheryl/Home.html" rel="nofollow">Cheryl Logan</a> and four colleagues have won a grant of
nearly $900,000 from the National Science Foundation to conduct
research on ocean acidification and hypoxia.</p>
<p>Dr. Logan, along with Dr. Scott Hamilton from Moss Landing
Marine Labs and Drs. Brian Tissot, Eric Bjorkstedt and Jeffrey
Abell from Humboldt State will combine their expertise to examine
how climate change can affect the behavior, physiology and gene
expression of rocky reef fishes.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;Having a team of scientists who are located all across California
and specialize in everything from ecology to molecular physiology
to oceanography will allow us to more efficiently address
challenging and complex scientific questions,&#x201D; Dr. Hamilton
said.<br>

study, which starts in September, will use CSU research facilities
in central and northern California. Scientists will be able to
study the same species of fish in two locations and determine how
fishes adapt to different environmental threats. They will study
how the sensory systems, brain function and swimming physiology of
the fishes changes as a result of climate change, as well as
examine the molecular basis of those changes at the cellular
level.<br>
<br>
Understanding the effects of ocean acidification and hypoxia (low
oxygen levels) is critical for predicting future climate change
responses of global fish populations and determining their ability
to tolerate or adapt to changes in ocean chemistry.<br>
<br>
Faculty members will integrate their research into the classroom
curriculum to give students real-life examples of textbook
principles. And students who are aspiring scientists will have the
opportunity to work on the project and gain hands-on
experience.<br>
<br>
The five CSU faculty researchers will also tap the expertise of
Susan Sogard from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration National Marine Fisheries Service, who played a role
in the initial research. With funding support from the CSU Council
on Ocean Affairs, Science &amp; Technology (COAST), the
interdisciplinary team was able to collect the preliminary data
that went into the proposal that helped them win the grant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
