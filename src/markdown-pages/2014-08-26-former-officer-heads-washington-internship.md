<a href="http://www.panettainstitute.org/programs/study-with-us/congressional-intern-training/" rel="nofollow">Congressional Internship Program</a> through the
Panetta Institute for Public Policy. All were selected based on
exemplary academic achievement and interest in politics, policy and
pubic service.</img></p>
<p>A kinesiology major, Holman is interested in public health. &#x201C;I
applied for the internship because I am really interested in
supporting federal legislation focusing on childhood obesity, since
one of every three children is obese in our nation,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I would love to work with Michelle Obama&#x2019;s Let&#x2019;s Move!
campaign, which tries to promote a healthier younger
generation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While in Washington, she hopes to see how bills originate and
get through Congress, and to attend briefings and hearings on
public health issues.</p>
<p>Holman has been involved in student government at CSUMB, first
as a director of community affairs &#x2013; where she acted as the voice
of students at Marina and Seaside city council meetings &#x2013; and in
the executive position of chief operations officer. She has served
as an orientation leader and has represented her sorority on the
Multicultural Greek Council.</p>
<p>Prior to heading off to Capitol Hill on Aug. 23, Holman and the
other students attendied an intensive two-week course at the
Panetta Institute. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta taught
sessions on Congressional leadership, committees and policymaking,
and United State defense policies. Other classes covered key
domestic and foreign policy issues; White House relations with
Congress; House leadership and committee roles; and the role of the
intern.</p>
<p>While in Washington, the interns also attend regular seminars
with government leaders on policy issues including economics, the
environment, foreign affairs and defense resources.</p>
<p>Students earn academic credit for the 13-week internship
program.<br>

Loretta Sanchez, who represents the 46th District. The district
covers parts of Orange County.<br>
