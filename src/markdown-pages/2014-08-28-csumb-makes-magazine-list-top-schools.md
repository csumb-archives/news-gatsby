<p>CSU Monterey Bay fared well in the annual <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/" rel="nofollow">College Guide and Rankings</a> released Aug. 25 by
Washington Monthly magazine.</p>
<p><img alt="Washington Monthly cover" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/washington_monthly_cover.png" style="width:125px; float:left; height:159px">The nonprofit
magazine measures schools based on how well they enroll and
graduate low-income students, support research, and encourage
students&#x2019; public service. Among the factors it uses are the
percentage of students who receive Pell Grants, the federal aid for
low-income students; the net price of attendance after financial
aid; the numbers of students who join the Peace Corps; and faculty
awards for research.<br>
<br>
CSUMB was rated in the top 15 percent of schools in the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings-2014/masters-universities-rank.php" rel="nofollow">master&#x2019;s universities category</a>. According to the
magazine, 42 percent of CSUMB students receive Pell grants; the net
cost is $8,918; and 39 percent of students graduate after six
years.</br></br></img></p>
<p>Overall, CSUMB ranked 94th among the 671 schools in the
category. Its best rating &#x2013; 17th &#x2013; was in the category of service
staff, courses and financial aid support.</p>
<p>The Washington Monthly ranking is different from other prominent
listings such as the one compiled by U.S. News &amp; World Report,
which places more emphasis on a school&#x2019;s financial endowment,
academic reputation and selectivity in admission.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Instead of crediting colleges that reject the most applicants,
we recognize those that do the best job of enrolling and graduating
low-income students. Our rankings measure both research spending
and success in preparing undergraduates to earn Ph.D.&#x2019;s. And by
giving equal weight to public service, we identify colleges that
build a sense of obligation to their communities and the nation at
large,&#x201D; the magazine said.</p>
<p>Its measurements line up with the plan by President Obama to
rate colleges, the magazine&#x2019;s editors said. The administration&#x2019;s
new ratings, which are scheduled to go into effect in time for the
next school year, will include measures of affordability, access
and outcome.</p>
