<p>The 5Gyres Institute is on a mission to educate the world about
the downside of its reliance on single-use plastic. The institute
documents the prevalence of marine plastic pollution in oceans
around the globe by traveling to the large oceanic systems called
gyres, which tend to collect floating plastic.<br>

Rosevelt, a 2011 graduate of CSUMB&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s degree program in
applied marine and watershed science, joined a team from the 5Gyres
Institute on a sailing expedition to document changes in the
density of plastic pollution between the sub-tropical gyre and
sub-polar gyre in the North Atlantic Ocean.<br>
<br>
A few months before the voyage, staff members at 5Gyres had
inquired about Rosevelt&#x2019;s graduate work and the methodologies she
used to investigate beach litter in the Monterey Bay region. They
encouraged her to apply to join their expedition from Bermuda to
Iceland.<br>
<br>
Bermuda is located in the middle of a sub-tropical gyre. Rosevelt
was shocked to see the large quantity of plastic fragments as they
pulled up to the beach survey sites on mopeds. Organizations such
as the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and volunteer stewards
with Keep Bermuda Beautiful were happy to work with the 5Gyres team
to conduct surveys, even lending them a small boat.<br>

the beach surveys, the team departed by ship from St. George,
Bermuda. The crew was made up of 14 volunteers with various
backgrounds in environmental conservation, all eager to meet the
challenge of reducing plastic pollution.</img></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>Using three separate trawls &#x2013; a surface manta trawl made of a
4-foot rectangular metal mouth piece and 15-foot net; a surface
high-speed trawl which was a smaller version of the manta; and a
multi-level trawl which sampled multiple depths below the sea
surface &#x2013; the team found numerous pieces of plastic just a few
miles offshore.</p>
<p>In all, the research expedition took 20 days and a total of 37
trawls were deployed from Bermuda to the harbor in Reykjavik,
Iceland.</p>
<p>Rosevelt achieved her goal of seeing the extent of ocean plastic
pollution firsthand and noted that every single trawl sample
yielded plastic particles or pieces.</p>
<p>She also realized that the ocean is &#x201C;vast beyond description,
scary, thrilling, sacred and deserves to be respected and
protected.&#x201D;</p>
