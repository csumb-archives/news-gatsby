<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s efforts to prepare for natural disasters have
won recognition from the National Weather Service.</p>

recently been named a <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/ambassadors.html#.U6xKxv1D7Ys" rel="nofollow">Weather-Ready Nation Ambassador</a> and a Storm
Ready university.</img></p>
<p>The ambassador designation means that the university will work
with the National Weather Service to educate the community about
natural hazards and emergency preparedness. The goal is to minimize
the impact of natural disasters.</p>
<p>The initiative was started to recognize organizations &#x2013;
universities, businesses, government agencies, non-profits &#x2013;
committed to helping the nation be better prepared for, respond to,
and recover from weather-related disasters.<br>
<br>
CSUMB is the <a href="http://www.stormready.noaa.gov/university.htm" rel="nofollow">ninth campus in California</a> &#x2013; and second in the CSU
system &#x2013; to be designated storm-ready. Nationwide, 147 colleges and
universities have earned the designation.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.stormready.noaa.gov/" rel="nofollow">StormReady</a> is a nationwide community preparedness
program that uses a grassroots approach to help communities develop
plans to handle all types of severe weather &#x2014; from tornadoes to
tsunamis.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re well prepared with the facilities, plans, programs and
skills to be resilient to severe storms and their spin-offs,&#x201D; said
CSUMB&apos;s emergency manager Dick Bower (at left in photo).<br>
<br>
Why is this important?<br>
<br>
We live in the most severe weather-prone country on Earth. Each
year, Americans cope with an average of 10,000 thunderstorms, 5,000
floods, 1,000 tornadoes, and several deadly hurricanes.
Approximately 90 percent of all presidentially declared disasters
are weather related, leading to around 500 deaths per year and
billions of dollars in damage.<br>
