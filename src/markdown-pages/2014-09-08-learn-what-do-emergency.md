<h4>Preparedness Fair set for Sept. 11</h4>
<p>Should a disaster strike, university officials want campus
community members to be prepared, educated on what to do and have
the resources and training to be emergency-ready.</p>
<p><img alt="Emergency Preparedness logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/ready_reg.jpg" style="float:left; width:350px; height:263px">A good place to
start is the Otter Preparedness Fair, which will be held from 11
a.m. to 2 p.m., Sept. 11 on the campus quad. The third annual event
is sponsored by the Emergency Management, Health and Safety
Division of the University Police Department.</img></p>
<p>Attendees will learn how to prepare themselves, their families,
pets, homes and communities for an emergency. They can sign up for
first aid, CPR and automatic external defibrillator (AED) training
as well as Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training.</p>
<p>Information will be distributed, equipment and emergency
vehicles will be on display and demonstrations of AED use, fire
extinguishers, smoke detectors and first aid/CPR will be held.</p>
<p>&quot;In organizing this fair, our primary goal is to empower our
community, to bring more people into the preparedness circle and to
get them ready for a disaster,&quot; said Dick Bower, CSUMB&#x2019;s emergency
manager. &quot;Everyone should be prepared and this fair is really
intended for anyone who knows he or she should be prepared but
doesn&apos;t know where to start.&quot;</p>
<p>The fair is supported by several community partners and agencies
&#x2013; including fire departments from Seaside and the Presidio of
Monterey; CalFire; American Medical Response; American Red Cross;
Monterey County Health Department, Office of Emergency Services and
Sheriff&#x2019;s Department; and local CERT teams &#x2013; demonstrating the
interaction and cooperation needed in emergencies.</p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s efforts to prepare for natural disasters have won
recognition from the National Weather Service &#x2013; the university was
named a Weather-Ready Nation Ambassador and a Storm Ready
university. <a href="../../jun/26/csumb-recognized-preparedness-efforts.html" rel="nofollow">Read more here.</a></p>
