&quot;<a href="http://www.elteatrocampesino.com/" rel="nofollow">Valley
of the Heart</a>&#x201D; is a love story, rooted in historical events set
in the fertile Santa Clara Valley, then known as the &#x201C;Valley of
Heart&#x2019;s Delight,&#x201D; in 1941. The area is now Silicon Valley. Opening
in the days leading up to Pearl Harbor, it is the dramatic
interaction of two families &#x2013; the Yamaguchis and the Monta&#xF1;os.
Coming out of the Great Depression, both immigrant families
struggle to provide for the future of their American-born children.
The families&#x2019; oldest children, Ben and Teruko, fall in love and
emotional stakes are further heightened when the Japanese attack
Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941, throwing both families into uncertainty.
Issues of loyalty and patriotism provoke both rebellion and heroism
among young, imprisoned Japanese Americans while both Teruko and
Benjamin fight to maintain their dignity, identity, family, and
love in the face of war, fear, and separation. The play was written
and directed by CSUMB founding faculty member Luis Valdez. For more
information, contact the box office at 582-4580.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
