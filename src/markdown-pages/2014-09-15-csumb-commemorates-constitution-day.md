<p>The talk will be held in the University Center living room. The
University Center is located on Sixth Avenue and B Street. Driving

<p>Constitution Day programs have been required since 2004, when an
appropriations bill approved by Congress contained a requirement
that every school or university that receives federal money present
an annual program on the Constitution.</p>
