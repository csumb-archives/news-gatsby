<p>Students in the CSIT-in-3 program know a good opportunity when
they see it.</p>
<p>CSIT-in-3 is a collaboration between CSU Monterey Bay and
Hartnell College that enables students to earn a bachelor&#x2019;s degree
in computer science in three years. The program started in 2013 and
has just admitted its second cohort of 32 students.</p>

<a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Center</a> was notified of an unpaid
position for a student volunteer to work with Hopkins Marine
Station&#x2019;s <a href="http://baseline.stanford.edu" rel="nofollow">Shark Baselines Project</a>. When students learned of
it, many of them wanted to participate.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;They need to have worked on projects to help them get
internships,&#x201D; said Katie Cunningham, computer science education
coordinator. &#x201C;And they know that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hopkins needed people with coding skills, the ability to develop
and manage mobile applications as well as develop dynamic web
pages. Eight students volunteered for the project. Some wanted to
work on the web pages, others liked the idea of developing apps for
data collection and presentation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I recruited a whole team from CSUMB,&#x201D; said Dr. Francesco
Ferretti, a researcher at Hopkins. &#x201C;The students are now working on
different aspects of SharkPulse.&#x201D;</p>
<p>SharkPulse is a smartphone app developed to involve citizen
scientists in monitoring global shark populations. It allows people
to upload their photos &#x2013; with information about when and where the
pictures were taken &#x2013; to the Shark Baselines Project, where they
can be studied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Right now we have five working groups: database development and
management; IOS app; Android app; web application and front end;
and social media mining,&#x201D; Dr. Ferretti said. Students work with all
of the groups.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy with the students,&#x201D; Dr. Ferretti said. &#x201C;They seem
very motivated and energetic.&#x201D;</p>
