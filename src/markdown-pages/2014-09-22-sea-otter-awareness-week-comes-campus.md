Awareness Week</a>, the annual recognition of the vital role these
marine mammals play in the near-shore ecosystem, will be celebrated
Sept. 21-27.</p>

universities, zoos, aquariums, marine institutions, researchers,
educators and the public participate in events and activities
highlighting sea otters, their natural history and the conservation
issues facing them.</img></p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay &#x2013; where the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSUMBMonteRey" rel="nofollow">sea otter
is the school&#x2019;s mascot</a> &#x2013; will host a lecture at 7 p.m., Sept.

event, held in the University Center on Sixth Avenue and B Street.

<p>Sarah Strobel, a Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, will talk on
&#x201C;Skimming the Surface:&#xA0;How Sea Otters Sense Their Underwater
World.&quot;&#xA0;</p>
<p>As mammals balancing on the edge of survival, sea otters depend
on their senses and memory to make decisions in challenging
environmental conditions. Due to a high demand for energy, sea
otters must find clams buried deep in muddy substrate, abalones
squeezed into tight rock fissures, or small snails wandering along
kelp fronds, with little margin for error.</p>
<p>What senses does a foraging sea otter rely on to find and
capture prey, and how do their sensory abilities compare to those
of other aquatic mammals? How do sea otters even know where to
search for prey among different habitats?<br>
&#xA0;<br>
Audience members will learn about the methods used to answer these
questions, and the impressive ways in which sea otters use their
senses to overcome the daily challenges of an underwater life.</br></br></p>
