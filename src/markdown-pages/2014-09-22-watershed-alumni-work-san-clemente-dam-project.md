<h3>&apos;Happy Fish, Happy Frogs&apos; crew</h3>
<p>Evan De Lay, Sheldon Leiker, and Elizabeth Geisler, graduates of
CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s Applied Marine and Watershed Science program,
are working on the removal of the San Clemente Dam from the Carmel
River.</p>
<p><img alt="CSUMB alumni work for Granite Construction on the Carmel River dam project" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/san_clemente_dam_alums.jpg" style="width:350px; height:254px; float:left">Because each had
worked extensively on the river, they were hired by Granite
Construction to be part of the environmental compliance team.<br>
<br>
Geisler (&#x2019;14) has worked on the river for seven years, first as a
field biologist for the Monterey Peninsula Water Management
District (MPWMD) and then as a graduate student researcher
investigating sediment transport. Leiker (&#x2019;14) also investigated
sediment transport while a graduate student, and De Lay (&#x2019;13)
conducted water quality monitoring of steelhead trout habitat for
the water management district.<br>
<br>
The team&apos;s daily work entails biological monitoring on the
construction site, taking flow measurements in the river and on
site, water quality sampling, and reporting to regulatory agencies,
such as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the
State Water Resources Control Board. The team ensures that the
project is in compliance with all relevant environmental permits &#x2013;
which is why some of the project engineers refer to it as the
&#x201C;Happy Fish, Happy Frogs&quot; crew.</br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>The project involves a unique and innovative approach to dam
removal. The Carmel River will be completely rerouted into the San
Clemente Creek tributary to prevent sediment loading downstream,
and may serve as a model for future dam removals in California and
the nation.</p>
<p>Removing the dam will restore natural sediment transport within
the river and give steelhead trout &#x2013; a threatened species &#x2013; access
to 25 miles of additional spawning habitat. It will also eliminate
potential problems the seismically unsafe structure could cause in
an earthquake.</p>
