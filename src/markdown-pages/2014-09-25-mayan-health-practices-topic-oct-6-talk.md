Ca&#x2019;amal Itz&#xE1;, the United Nations representative for the Mayan
People, will visit Cal State Monterey Bay on Oct. 6 as part of
Hispanic Heritage Month.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The Wisdom of Mayan Health Practices: Understanding the Mayan
Cosmovision&#x201D; is the topic for the 11:30 a.m. talk. The event will
be held in the Music Hall, located on Sixth Avenue near Col. Durham
Street.</p>
<p>Professor Itz&#xE1; became interested in radio and other forms of
communication in the early 1990s, while studying agriculture and
plant sciences at Mexico&#x2019;s University of Chapingo. He combined his
interest in media and his knowledge of agriculture to create radio
programs in the Mayan language. Those programs continue to
emphasize sustainable farming practices and the benefits of
traditional knowledge and provide daily market information,
bulletins about regional agricultural trends and analysis of
farming issues.</p>
<p>He won the 2003 George Atkins Communication Award, given to
someone who demonstrates excellence in the use of radio to
contribute to positive change in rural communities.</p>
<p>In the last decade, he has worked with local governments on
sustainable rural development projects. He has also collaborated
with non-governmental organizations on issues related to climate
change, which is leading to an exodus of young people from rural
areas to cities.</p>
<p>His lifelong goal has been to preserve the intangible knowledge
of Mayan communities.</p>
<p>His lecture will be delivered in Spanish with simultaneous
English translation.</p>
<p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>. While the talk is
free, a parking permit must be purchased from a machine on the lot

<p>The talk is sponsored by the College of Health Sciences and
Human Services.</p>
