graduates of the California State University system.</img></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s one of the largest alumni networks in the world.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, 2015 graduates as well as alumni from
all 23 CSU campuses are invited to &#x201C;sign&#x201D; The Class of 3 Million
Yearbook. The online yearbook is a way for CSU alums to connect and
build relationships with one another.</p>
<p>Everyone who signs the yearbook will be entered to win one of
three $10,000 scholarships for a current or future student. All
2015 grads will receive Class of 3 Million silicone wristbands in
time for commencement ceremonies.</p>
