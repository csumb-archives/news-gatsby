<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s concert series resumes on Oct. 13 with a free
performance by A/B Duo.</p>
<p>Included in the program is a new piece for contrabass flute and
percussion written by Monterey County native Ned McGowan.</p>
<p>A/B Duo &#x2013; percussionist Christopher Jones and flutist Meerenai
Shim &#x2013; performs contemporary music. Part garage band, part Bang on
a Can All Stars, they commission most of the music they perform. It
varies wildly in style and instrumentation &#x2013; from djembe and
contrabass flute to Nintendo Gameboy and drum set.</p>
<p class="pullquote">One of the most charming concerts imaginable.
. . . The music was bouncy, strange, interesting and fun. A/B Duo
is worth seeking out.<br>
&#x2013; Civic Center Blog (San Francisco)</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;There are so many possibilities with the combination of flute
and percussion, with all of the percussion instruments, and I also
have five flutes that I can use &#x2013; piccolo, flute, alto flute, bass
flute and contra-bass flute,&#x201D; Shim told a reviewer for the website
Cleveland Classical.com.<br>
&#x201C;And stylistically speaking, some people describe what Chris and I
do as chamber rock. I&#x2019;ve heard others say it&#x2019;s a combination of
popular music and art music,&#x201D; Shim said.</br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Things We Dream About,&#x201D; their rock and roll and Gameboy infused
extended play record, was released in December 2013. The duo is
currently recording its first full-length album, tentatively titled
&#x201C;Ricochet,&#x201D; to be released in fall 2015.<br>
<br>
The free concert will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Hall on
Sixth Avenue and Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus map
can be found at csumb.edu/maps. Please note that a parking permit
must be purchased from a machine on the adjacent lot or <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy-permit" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</br></br></p>
