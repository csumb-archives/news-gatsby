<p>Professor Corey Garza has been successful in attracting
underserved students &#x2013; minorities, low income and first-generation
college students &#x2013; to ocean sciences.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Corey Garza" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/garza_small_0.jpg" style="width:300px; height:328px; float:left">He has established
a <a href="../../jul/30/ocean-science-attracts-summer-researchers.html" rel="nofollow">Research Experiences for Undergraduates</a> program at
Cal State Monterey Bay and has built up the ocean science program
at the annual <a href="https://sacnas.org" rel="nofollow">SACNAS</a> &#x2013; Society for the Advancement of
Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science &#x2013;
conference.</img></p>
<p>Now, he is sharing his approaches for improving diversity in the
field.</p>
<p>Dr. Garza, a professor in the Division of Science and
Environmental Policy, delivered the keynote talk at the <a href="http://oceanleadership.org" rel="nofollow">Consortium for Ocean
Leadership&#x2019;</a>s biennial educators retreat in Savannah, Ga., on
Sept. 24. The consortium is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit
organization that represents more than 100 of the leading public
and private ocean research and education institutions in the
country.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As part of my talk, I referenced a recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/16/343539024" rel="nofollow">NPR story</a> that highlights some of the struggles
postdocs are having in seeking out faculty and senior research
positions,&#x201D; Dr. Garza said.</p>
<p>He said he and some of his colleagues in SACNAS believe this is
due, in part, to the fact that biomedical fields have been
overemphasized to underserved students. &#x201C;By not encouraging these
students to diversify the scientific pathways they take &#x2013; into
fields such as ocean science &#x2013; we are producing far too many
students in a narrow range of fields,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>His presentation put a spotlight on CSUMB&#x2019;s <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/ms/" rel="nofollow">marine science</a>
program and the university&#x2019;s diversity-related efforts.<br>
<br>
He reported that his talk was well received, &quot;and many of the items
I discussed will be action items for the larger group of
institutions to work on in regard to increasing diversity on their
campuses,&quot; he said.</br></br></p>
