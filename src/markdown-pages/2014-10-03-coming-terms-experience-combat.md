<h3>Author discusses memoir Oct. 10 at CSUMB</h3>
<p>As a Marine lieutenant during the Vietnam War, Karl Marlantes
learned what every young officer learns &#x2013; to fire a rifle, to
command a platoon, to fight and to kill. Over the next four
decades, he spent his time reading, thinking and writing a memoir
that helped him come to terms with that experience.</p>

It Is Like to Go to War,&#x201D; Marlantes writes that while the Marine
Corps trained him to kill, &#x201C;it didn&#x2019;t teach me how to deal with
killing.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>If the folks at the nonprofit organization Cal Humanities have
their way, people will be reading Marlantes&#x2019; book this fall. It&#x2019;s
the featured selection of California Reads: The War Comes Home, a
program offered by libraries throughout the state. Its goal: to
bring people together to think and talk about what it is like to be
a veteran.</p>
<p>Marlantes&#x2019; book tour as part of California Reads includes
multiple stops in Northern and Southern California, at public
libraries, colleges and universities, and veterans centers.</p>
<p>Locally, Monterey County Free Libraries will sponsor a
discussion with the author on Oct. 10 at 5:30 p.m. in CSU Monterey
Bay&#x2019;s library, Room 1180. While the event is free, attendees must
purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot or <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy-permit" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</p>
<p>The first 100 attendees will receive a free copy of the
book.</p>
<p>Marlantes told the Orange County Register that he is flattered
to have his book chosen. &#x201C;California is an immense state with
immense diversity from the Oregon border to the Mexican border. To
have an organization that&#x2019;s going to span that much difference &#x2013;
sociologically and geographically &#x2013; read my book, I&#x2019;m thrilled,&#x201D; he
told the Register.<br>
<br>
Monterey County Free Libraries has organized several other
activities related to the book. <a href="http://www.co.monterey.ca.us/library/CalReads.html" rel="nofollow">Learn more about them here.</a></br></br></p>
