from community college to CSU Monterey Bay in 2009, I thought I
knew what I wanted to do with my life: I would study business,
graduate and move up to Silicon Valley or New York to pursue a life
of big deals and enterprise.<br>
<br>
But later that year, the most incredible opportunity flashed into
my student inbox and it changed my life forever.<br>
<br>
It was an application for the Panetta Institute Congressional
Internship Program. Every year, the program sends one student from
every CSU to Washington, D.C., to intern with a member of Congress
from the California delegation. It pays for your trip, provides a
stipend, and you receive college credit.<br>
<br>
I remember thinking, &#x201C;Wow, this is an unbelievable opportunity. Too
bad I don&#x2019;t have a chance.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
But one application, several group interviews, and some essays
later, I was selected to represent CSUMB in the 2010 Panetta
Internship class. It was one of the most incredible experiences of
my life. Working on Capitol Hill, living in Washington and being
surrounded by the most dedicated, hard-working people I had ever
met confirmed to me that I had to dedicate my life to public
service.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
