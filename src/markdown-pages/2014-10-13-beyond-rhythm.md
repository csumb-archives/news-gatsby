<h3>Master of the mbira celebrates melody, harmony in African
music</h3>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s concert series continues on Oct. 24 when the
community is invited to an afternoon of African music and culture
with mbira and marimba master Cosmas Magaya of Zimbabwe.</p>

African music may have heard the unique sound of the mbira, an
instrument that consists of keys over a bridge on a hardwood
soundboard. It&#x2019;s found in hundreds of varieties, from small
versions with one row of keys to much more complex instruments with
as many as 52 keys.</img></p>
<p>While the mbira, sometimes called a &#x201C;thumb piano,&#x201D; is found in
much of Africa, it has a central place and rich history in
Zimbabwe. In the 1500s, Portuguese missionaries noted the
instrument being played at the courts of African chiefs. Among the
Shona people, it&#x2019;s used in every facet of life &#x2013; at weddings and
funerals, at rainmaking, thanksgiving and religious ceremonies and
in healing.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, Mr. Magaya (pictured at right) has been
visiting North America to teach and lecture at&#xA0;universities
including Duke and Harvard. He has performed throughout the U.S.
and Europe.</p>
<p>The free concert will be held at 2 p.m. in the Music Hall on
Sixth Avenue and Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus map
can be found at csumb.edu/maps. Please note that a parking permit
