<p>NCAAW is the largest single event in all of academia because
students take ownership in designing and implementing this
observance for their campus communities. This week also provides
campuses the opportunity to showcase healthy lifestyles free from
the abuse or illegal use of alcohol and to combat negative
stereotypes associated with college drinking behavior.</p>
<p>University faculty and staff also play a vital role in working
with students to educate them about alcohol.</p>
<p>&#x201C;NCAAW allows us to show our students here at CSUMB &#x2013;
particularly new students &#x2013; that most of their peers are not
abusing alcohol and most are making healthy and safe decisions,&#x201D;
said Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist for
the Campus Health Center.</p>
<p>NCAAW 2014 also highlights the &#x201C;Aware, Awake, Alive!&#x201D; program,
implemented at CSUMB and all other CSU campuses. The program, which
equips students with the tools and knowledge to prevent
alcohol-related deaths, was created by Scott and Julia Starkey
after they lost their son, Carson, to alcohol poisoning while he
was a freshman at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This program is ideal for college students because it educates
them on the symptoms of alcohol poisoning, creates awareness on the
conditions that enable it, and encourages responsibility for one
another in situations where alcohol is consumed,&#x201D; Rodriguez
said.</p>
<p>NCAAW at CSUMB is a collaborative effort of Health &amp;
Wellness Services, the POWER Peer Education Program, Student
Housing &amp; Residential Life, the Residential Housing
Association, Athletics, the Student Athlete Advisory Council,
