<h3>CSUMB joins statewide message of hope</h3>
<p>California State University campuses throughout the state are
holding candle-lighting events this month to send a message of
support, understanding and comfort to those who have been impacted
by suicide or other mental health-related challenges.</p>
<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/candle.jpg" style="float:left; width:240px; height:159px">The community is
invited to attend Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s event from 7 to 9 p.m.,
Oct. 14, on the campus quad. It will be an opportunity to light a
candle, write a message, pick up information and help to create a
thousand lights for all of us.</img></p>
<p>Why light a candle? Can a candle really say something or change
anything?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This candle will be your voice in the darkness for those who
feel misunderstood, alone, ashamed, guilty, sad or hopeless,&#x201D; said
Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist at
CSUMB. &#x201C;It will say, &#x2018;You matter to me. I may not know exactly what
to say or what to do, but here is what my heart wants to say.&#x2019;
&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rodriguez points out that the pain, isolation, suffering and
other effects of mental health problems will be most effectively
reduced by a caring, informed and connected community. &#x201C;We are
creating a strong, unified statement through the thousands of
lights,&#x201D; he said.</p>
