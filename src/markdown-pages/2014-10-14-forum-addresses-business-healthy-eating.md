<h3>&apos;Greater Vision&apos; forum looks at public health and
agriculture</h3>
<p>The &#x201C;Greater Vision&#x201D; series of public forums on topics important
to local agriculture and the larger community continues Oct. 22 at
California State University, Monterey Bay. The topic is &#x201C;The
Business of Healthy Eating.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Central Coast agriculture grows fruits and vegetables
recommended for a healthy diet. The agriculture industry and public
health are working together to protect the environment and prevent
diseases such as diabetes. A public-private partnership, uneasy at
times, is emerging to address this challenge.</p>

address how the systems of production agriculture and the promotion
of public health can work together to provide value-added produce
at an affordable price while protecting farm workers and the
environment. In three annual sessions, experts will examine this
challenge and how it can be addressed through public policy,
marketing programs designed to promote the public good, and new
production technologies</img></p>

Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.&#x201D; A panel discussion will follow;
panelists include CSUMB professors Brad Barbeau and Trish Sevene;
