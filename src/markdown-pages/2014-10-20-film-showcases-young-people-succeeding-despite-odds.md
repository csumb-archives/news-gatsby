<h3>CSUMB student featured in documentary about East Salinas</h3>
<p>A feature-length documentary that had its California premiere at
the Carmel International Film Festival features a CSU Monterey Bay
student.</p>
<p><img alt="Insert a description of the image here." src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/yahaira_.jpg" style="width:350px; height:466px; float:right">Yajaira, a senior
at the university, is one of four young adults profiled in &#x201C;The
Salinas Project&#x201D; by American University journalism professor and
filmmaker Carolyn Brown.</img></p>
<p>All four of the young people &#x2013; children of immigrant farmworkers
&#x2013; live in East Salinas, an area where deplorable housing conditions
and gang violence are part of daily life. All are succeeding
despite their challenging life circumstances, overcoming social,
political and economic constraints.</p>
<p>The film follows Yajaira; Fernanda, an activist who spoke in
Washington, D.C., about youth efforts to combat violence; Lolo, a
musician who played the French horn at Carnegie Hall and studied
classical music at Long Beach State; and Angel, who graduated from
Fullerton State and returned to East Salinas to help his
community.</p>
<p>Yajaira was 18 and starting her first year at CSUMB when filming
began. She is on tract to graduate this year, despite working
30-hour weeks at a restaurant and dealing with uncertainty around
her family situation and housing.</p>
<p>At the premiere, Brown said she hopes the documentary &#x201C;helps
viewers understand a community that is often misrepresented in the
media as many news stories focus primarily on the gang
violence.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My film gives a realistic portrayal of how abundant hope and
resilience can defy stereotypes and circumstances,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>At the screening, Brown said the film is scheduled for national
broadcast on public television, perhaps as soon as next summer.</p>
