<h3>La Santa Cecilia &#x2013; A band with a message</h3>
<p>La Santa Cecilia is set to rock CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s University
Center on Oct. 29.</p>
<p><img alt="La Santa Cecilia" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/la_santa_cecilia.jpg" style="width:300px; height:450px; float:right">Coming off its
recent Grammy win for &#x201C;Best Latin Rock/Alternative/Urban Album,&#x201D; La
Santa Cecilia has enchanted its fans with diverse genres, powerful
lyrical messages and colorful performances.</img></p>
<p>Band members are accordionist and requintero Jos&#xE9; &#x201C;Pepe&#x201D; Carlos,
bassist Alex Benda&#xF1;a, and percussionist Miguel Ramirez and lead
vocalist Marisol Hernandez, La Marisoul, who sings about love, loss
and heartbreak. Their love of music and openness to all genres led
them to form La Santa Cecilia in 2007, named for the patron saint
of musicians.</p>
<p>Their influences range from Miles Davis to The Beatles, Led
Zeppelin to Janis Joplin and Mercedes Sosa to Ramon Ayala.</p>
<p>In 2013, the band released its major label debut Treinta Dias
(30 Days), which features a collaboration with Elvis Costello.
Their new album, Someday New, features seven new tracks including
the moving, and militant, ICE &#x2013; El Hielo.</p>
<p>The band has emerged as a voice for traditionally voiceless and
faceless immigrants. &#x201C;La Santa Cecilia reflects a pivotal moment in
the evolving cultural understanding of undocumented immigrants,&#x201D;
the Washington Post said of the band last year when it performed in
the nation&#x2019;s capital, pressing for reform of current immigrant
laws.</p>
<p>Showtime is 7 p.m. in the University Center, located on Sixth
Avenue at B Street. General admissions tickets are $20; students
$10; children $5. Discounts are available for seniors and military
members. Tickets can be purchased on the World Theater <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">website</a>&#xA0;or
