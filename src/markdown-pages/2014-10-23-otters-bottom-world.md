<p>While penguins and seals call it home, there are few permanent
human residents on Antarctica. But, each year, several thousand
people temporarily reside at research stations scattered across the
continent.<br>
<br>
At the moment, two of them are CSU Monterey Bay alumni.<br>
<br>

Erin Frolli, both members of the Class of 2012, had a chance
meeting there recently while working on separate projects.<br>
<br>
Running into Frolli was an &#x201C;incredible&#x201D; surprise, Johnson said via
e-mail. &#x201C;I had arrived a few days ahead of her group and was
finishing our required safety training when she walked past me in
the hall.&#x201D;&#xA0;<br>
<br>
Frolli was equally surprised. &quot;You don&apos;t expect to see a fellow
UROCer at the bottom of the world,&quot; she said.</br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>They see each other often at work and around the town that is
McMurdo Station.</p>
<p>After graduating from CSUMB &#x2013; where both were involved with the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center or UROC &#x2013; they went in
separate directions for graduate school.</p>
<p>Armed with a double major in math and environmental science,
technology and policy, Frolli headed to Bozeman, Montana, where she
earned a master&#x2019;s degree in land resources and environmental
sciences. That led to a staff position as a scientific associate in
the lab of Dr. Lee Fuiman at the University of Texas. Dr. Fuiman&#x2019;s
research on foraging and navigation behavior of Weddell seals took
Frolli to Antarctica.</p>
<p>With his prestigious National Science Foundation Graduate
Research Fellowship &#x2013; worth $90,000 over three years &#x2013; Johnson went
to UC Santa Barbara to pursue a Ph.D. in marine biology.</p>
<p>At McMurdo Station, he is researching the impacts of climate
change &#x2013; specifically ocean&#xA0;<img alt="Pteropods " src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/pteropods.jpg" style="width:250px; height:188px; float:right">acidification &#x2013; on
the development and physiology of marine invertebrates. Ocean
acidification directly impacts the ability of many marine
invertebrates to produce calcium carbonate shells; Johnson is
measuring these effects on several organisms at the molecular
level.</img></p>
<p>He is &#x201C;completely blown away&#x201D; by the stark beauty of Antarctica.
&#x201C;It is a remarkable feeling to drive a snow mobile for an hour out
onto the sea ice, drill a hole and then drop a net down to 300
feet,&#x201D; Johnson said.</p>
<p>On the sea ice, &#x201C;We are surrounded by icebergs that have
temporarily been trapped, forming 40-foot-tall pinnacles of blue
ice. Further out looms the presence of Mount Erebus, the
southernmost active volcano in the world.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With everything covered in white, the world takes on a
gray-blue scale that is hard to describe,&#x201D; he said.</p>
