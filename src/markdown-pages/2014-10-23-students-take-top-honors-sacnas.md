students took a first-place award and two seconds at the recent
conference of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and
Native Americans in Science.</img></p>
<p>SACNAS is a 40-year-old nonprofit organization that fosters
Hispanic/Chicano and Native American scientists from college
students to professionals.</p>
<p>The annual conference &#x2013; funded in large part by the National
Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health &#x2013; is the
society&#x2019;s showcase. It brings together students and professional
scientists from around the country as well as university
representatives there to recruit students for their graduate
programs.</p>
<p>This year, about 3,000 students and 1,000 scientists gathered in
Los Angeles; 1,200 students presented the results of their
research.</p>
<p>CSUMB was represented by 15 undergraduates, four graduate
students and four students from other schools who were part of last
summer&#x2019;s Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experience
for Undergraduates based at CSUMB. They presented research posters
in ecology and evolution, general biology and marine biology.</p>
<p>Earning awards were:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Alison Aceves, marine science major and McNair Scholar, took
first place in ecology and evolution. She spent last summer working
at the Hatfield Marine Science Center at Oregon State University,
studying host-parasite interactions of salmon in the Columbia
River.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Emily King, marine science major and McNair Scholar, took
second place in marine biology. She also spent the summer at the
Hatfield Center, researching larval fish behavior.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Briana Becerra, biology major and McNair Scholar, took second
place in ecology and evolution. She spent the summer at the Hubbard
Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, researching forest
ecology.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Danielle Perry, a participant in last summer&#x2019;s Ocean Science
REU at CSUMB and a student at the University of New Haven, took
first place in marine biology. She spent the summer working at
Elkhorn Slough.</p>
<p>All of the students took advantage of professional development
opportunities at the conference and attended scientific
sessions.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The conference attendees I spoke with were highly complimentary
of our students in how they presented their research, the quality
of their work and their overall professionalism at the conference,&#x201D;
said Dr. Corey Garza, associate professor in the Division of
Science and Environmental Policy, director of the Monterey Bay
Regional Ocean Science REU and the university&#x2019;s SACNAS chapter
adviser.</p>
