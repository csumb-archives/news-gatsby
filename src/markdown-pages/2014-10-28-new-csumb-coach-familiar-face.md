<p>Although Darcy Milligan only started as CSU Monterey Bay&apos;s
women&apos;s golf coach a few weeks ago, she is a familiar face at the
Otters&apos; home courses of Bayonet and Black Horse. Not only is
Milligan an assistant golf professional at the courses, she played
for the Otters from 2007 to 2011.<br>
