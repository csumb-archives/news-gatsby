<h3>December People returns to World Theater Nov. 8 by popular
demand</h3>
<p>Kick off the holiday season on Nov. 8 when the December People &#x2013;
Robert Berry, Gary Pihl, Dave Medd, David Lauser and Jack Foster &#x2013;
make an anticipated appearance at California State University,
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s World Theater. The group has played to enthusiastic,
standing-room-only houses the last four years and this year
promises more of the same.</p>
<p><img alt="December People will return to the World Theater on Nov. 8" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/decpeo_performance.jpg" style="width:400px; height:267px; float:left">So, what exactly is
December People? Something classic, something new, something
familiar . . . but totally original.</img></p>
<p>The group is one part tribute band, one part radio sensation,
one part traditional holiday music, and one part just plain fun
with their hilariously sincere imagining of what familiar holiday
songs might sound like if played by Santana, The Who, Led Zepplin,
Sting, ZZ Top, Boston, U2, ELP, Queen and Peter Gabriel, to name a
few.</p>
<p>Each member brings a wealth of experience with well-known
bands.</p>
<p>Berry, who came up with the idea for the group and is the lead
vocalist and bass player, sang for the bands &#x201C;3&#x201D; and Ambrosia,
played bass in the Sammy Hagar band, and was in the band GTR with
Steve Howe of YES. He is the bass player for the Greg Kihn
Band.</p>
<p>Pihl, guitar and vocals, has been a member of the band Boston
since 1985, played in the Sammy Hagar Band and worked with Norman
Greenbaum of Spirit and Sky.</p>
<p>Medd, vocals and keyboard, is keyboard player for the Tubes and
has toured with Quicksilver Messenger Service and Alliance.</p>
<p>Lauser is a drummer with the Sammy Hagar band and is sitting in
for Mike Vanderhule, who is touring in Europe.</p>
<p>They&#x2019;ve taken Christmas classics and made them accessible and
enjoyable for listeners of all ages. Their contemporary take on
each song sheds a whole new light on both the classic rock songs
that influenced the music and timeless Christmas carol lyrics. Each
song is familiar and yet brand new.</p>
<p>The World Theater is partnering with HIPPO FM 104.3 to help
those in need again this holiday season. The performances will
include a holiday food drive to benefit the Food Bank for Monterey
County, the Monterey County SPCA and the Santa Cruz Animal Shelter.
Last year, 2,000 pounds of food &#x2013; for people and pets &#x2013; were
collected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be inspired not only by December People&#x2019;s outstanding
music but also by their continued generosity of helping our local
non-profits provide food for families during the holidays,&#x201D; said
World Theater artistic and executive director Joe Cardinalli.<br>
