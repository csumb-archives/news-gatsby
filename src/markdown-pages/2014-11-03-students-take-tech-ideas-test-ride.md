Santa Cruz have expanded the Jan. 9-11 hackathon from last year&#x2019;s
campus event to one that is open to high school and college
students around Monterey Bay. More than 300 programmers, designers
and tech enthusiasts are expected to compete for $10,000 in cash
and prizes.</img></p>
<p>A hackathon is a coding marathon where teams comprised of
developers, designers and entrepreneurs work together to create
apps and programs. The themes for this event are technology,
environmental stewardship and social justice.</p>
<p>CSUMB is one of the event sponsors. Information Technology and
Communications Design students as well as business students are
expected to enter since the hackathon involves writing code and
developing a business case for each team&#x2019;s project.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We are excited to be a part of the regional effort to build
entrepreneurial skills and interest through this event,&#x201D; said Dr.
Brad Barbeau, associate professor of economics and entrepreneurship
at CSUMB. &#x201C;This will benefit all of the students in the
region.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Judges will score projects based on technical difficulty,
functional completeness, usefulness and business potential.</p>
<p>About 100 UCSC students competed in the first hackathon last
April, developing apps to benefit local businesses. &#x201C;When we
surveyed the participants two weeks after the hackathon, we learned
that over half had been made job offers,&#x201D; Doug Erickson, founder of
the Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp said in a news release.</p>
