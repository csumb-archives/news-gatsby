<p>Fort Ord &#x2013; once the largest military base in the American West &#x2013;
was a vital center during much of&#xA0;<img alt="photo of abandoned Fort Ord building shown a mural" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/fort_ord_photo_for_web.jpg" style="width:400px; float:left; height:446px">the 20th century.
More than a million people lived and worked at the base. But that
was two decades ago; now, many people know it only as a ghost town
that surrounds CSU Monterey Bay.</img></p>
<p>That otherworldly quality has inspired Enid Ryce, chair of the
university&#x2019;s Cinematic Arts and Technology Department, to create
Planet Ord, a project that explores the contemporary experience and
historical echoes of the base. It&#x2019;s an artist&#x2019;s view of abandoned
buildings and the artwork that adorns many of them; it&#x2019;s also a
tribute to those who served at Fort Ord.<br>
<br>
Its goal: to understand the fort&#x2019;s history by immortalizing the
buildings and community memories.<br>
<br>
The Planet Ord project will be on display throughout November at
the Seaside, King City and Marina branches of the Monterey County
Free Libraries (MCFL). The exhibit features photos and painted maps
that depict the fort&#x2019;s history and showcase the many ethereal
murals found there. An interactive portion allows visitors to share
their memories of Fort Ord.<br>

reception and talk will be held at each library.</img></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; Seaside, 550 Harcourt Ave.: Nov. 8, 3 p.m.</p>
<p>&#x2022; King City, 402 Broadway St.: Nov. 15, 3 p.m.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Marina, 190 Seaside Circle: Nov. 22, 2:30 p.m<br>
<br>
At each talk, Ryce will give a multimedia presentation on the
long-decommissioned base, and show films made by her
students.<br>
<br>
The Planet Ord exhibits and talks are supported by War Comes Home,
an initiative from Cal Humanities.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The images presented by Planet Ord are powerful and evoke emotions
that tell the stories of many local veterans,&#x201D; said Jenna Severson,
MCFL programming librarian.<br>
