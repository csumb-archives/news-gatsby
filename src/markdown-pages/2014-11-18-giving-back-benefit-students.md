<h3>Benefactors recognized for providing scholarships</h3>
<p>Bob Johnson and Diego Espinoza will be among the honorees at the
National Philanthropy Day luncheon on Nov. 21. Both were nominated
for awards by CSU Monterey Bay, but they share something much more
important.</p>
<p><img alt="Bob Johnson" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/bob.johnson_0.jpg" style="width:225px; height:338px; float:left">Each is motivated
to help others by a woman who influenced him greatly. In Johnson&#x2019;s
case, it was his mother. For Espinoza, it was a kind and caring
university staff member.</img></p>
<p>Johnson, a retired Salinas Valley grower and CSUMB Foundation
board member, will receive the Outstanding Philanthropist award at
the annual event.</p>
<p>Two decades after his mother&#x2019;s death, he remains awed by her
accomplishments.<br>
<br>
He hopes her example can inspire students to set and achieve
ambitious goals, and since 2005, when he established a scholarship
endowment in her honor, he has contributed more than $500,000 in
support of students, faculty and programs.<br>
<br>
Jane Pere Johnson, who was 85 when she died in 1992, came to
Monterey County from the Pyrenees region of France when she was 13
years old. As a young woman, she married Harry Johnson and raised
three sons near Chualar, south of Salinas. She instilled in her
children the values of education and hard work, and all three went
to college.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The older I got, the more I reflected on what she accomplished in
her life with almost zero education,&#x201D; Johnson told CSUMB&#x2019;s magazine
in 2012. &#x2028;&#x201C;I still have a hard time believing it, but it really
happened.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
The Jane Pere Johnson Scholarship is awarded on a priority basis to
students who have attended Chualar Elementary School, Gonzales High
School or Hartnell College in Salinas. Dozens of students have
benefited.<br>
<br>
Many Chualar students now come from immigrant farm worker families,
and Johnson said he wants to encourage them to reach for the
opportunities made possible by a college degree.<br>
&#x201C;Education is the ticket to a better life,&#x201D; he said.<br>
<br>
<strong>Diego Espinoza</strong><br>
<br>
A university staff member&#x2019;s dedication to helping migrant students
inspired Espinoza to honor her memory with a scholarship. For that
effort, he will be honored as the Outstanding Young Adult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
<p><img alt="Diego Espinoz" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/diego_espinoza.jpg" style="width:225px; height:205px; float:right">Now a senior at
CSUMB, Espinoza moved to Salinas from Mexico when he was 12 years
old. He encountered the problems many migrant students face &#x2013;
limited English skills, overcrowded housing, exposure to violence
in the community.</img></p>
<p>A counselor with CSUMB&#x2019;s College Assistance Migrant Program
helped him through the application and registration process. That&#x2019;s
where he encountered Carrie Gonzalez, &#x201C;Miss Carrie&#x201D; to the students
who came into her orbit.</p>
<p>Sensing his strong motivation to help others, Miss Carrie hired
Espinoza to be a peer mentor for incoming migrant students. That
position brought a sense of fulfillment, and his grades quickly
improved. After his sophomore year, however, she died of
cancer.</p>
<p>To honor her dedication to students and thank her for the
support she provided during his first two years of college,
Espinosa is leading the effort to raise at least $5,000 for a
scholarship in Miss Carrie&#x2019;s name. He hopes the recipients will be
inspired to pay it forward.</p>
<p>Raising scholarship money is only part of his philanthropic
work. He also serves as community service liaison for his
fraternity and volunteers as a basketball and soccer coach for
youngsters in East Salinas.</p>
<p>National Philanthropy Day is an opportunity to reflect on the
meaning of giving and all that it makes possible. The local
celebration, now in its 23rd year, is hosted by the Development
Executives Network and the Monterey Bay chapter of the Association
of Fundraising Professionals.<br>
<br>
Awards are presented to individuals, corporations, service
organizations, youth and young adults who demonstrate an
exceptional commitment to the community. Nominations are rated by a
team of reviewers from the local AFP and DEN chapters, business
leaders and leaders of private foundations.<br>
