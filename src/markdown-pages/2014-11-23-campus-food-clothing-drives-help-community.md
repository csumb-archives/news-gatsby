<p>CSU Monterey Bay is embracing the spirit of the holiday season
with a flurry of charitable activities intended to help the local
community.</p>
<p><img alt="World Theater staff members with food donations" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/santas_helpers.jpg" style="float:right; width:350px; height:261px">&#x2022; Representatives
from the Food Bank for Monterey County loaded hundreds of pounds of
canned goods into a delivery truck parked at the World Theater on
Nov. 13. The haul &#x2013; totaling more than two tons of people and pet
food &#x2013; was collected a few days earlier when the rock band December
People performed at the theater. To earn a discount on the ticket
price for the Nov. 8 performance, the capacity crowd was asked to
bring cans of food.</img></p>
<p>The drive was a collaboration between the World Theater and
radio station HIPPO 104.3 FM. The donations were given to the food
bank, the local SPCA and the Santa Cruz animal shelter.</p>

generosity of CSUMB students, staff and faculty and the sponsorship
of Sodexo, the university&#x2019;s food service provider, the Stop Hunger
drive netted 900 pounds of food in time to reach needy families for
Thanksgiving.</img></p>
<p>Sodexo holds the drive every October and November. Students can
contribute non-perishable food items or donate meal plan blocks
which campus dining converts into cash, matches the total and uses
to purchase bulk items such as bags of rice, beans, canned fruit,
canned milk and vegetables.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The Multi-Cultural Greek Council held a food drive to benefit
Dorothy&#x2019;s Place Hospitality Center in Salinas.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Anjelica Hererra and her Sigma Theta Psi sorority sisters are
collecting all things warm and cozy &#x2013;&#xAC; coats, sweaters, socks,
gloves, scarves and blankets &#x2013; to be distributed to the homeless in
the Chinatown area of Salinas. Donations will be accepted through
the end of November. To arrange a pick-up, contact <a href="mailto:stp.zeta.communityservice@gmail.com">stp.zeta.communityservice@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The University Police Department is participating in the
annual Crime Prevention Officers Association toy drive. New,
unwrapped toys can be placed in a barrel in the UPD lobby through
Dec. 17.<br>
