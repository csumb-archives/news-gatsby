<p>The free event, &#x201C;Artistic Reflections on Issues of
Sustainability and Systems Thinking,&#x201D; will be held in the Alumni

left) will talk on &#x201C;An Artist&#x2019;s Sculptural Commentary on Human
Survival, the Environment and Mythology.&#x201D; In his work, he uses
fragments of blown tires to explore the interconnected web that
provides for human survival, and its contradictory appeals and
perils. His work is about our increasing dependence on vulnerable
networks of transportation, electricity and finance for our food,
clothing, shelter, health and safety needs.</img></p>
<p>He believes that we need a new ideology that provides a
sustainable, balanced means for human survival within the natural
world that supports us.</p>

presentation is titled, &#x201C;Dance, Ecology, Somatics and
Permaculture.&#x201D; He has an MFA in modern dance, has taught, danced
professionally and has had his choreography produced by several
companies.</img></p>
<p>His research embodies ecology through movement aesthetics. He
explores questions about how we interact with our internal and
external environments; can we sense these relationships firsthand
by moving, or by witnessing movement? What do our movements reveal
about our worldviews?</p>
<p>A panel discussion with the artists will start about 1:20
p.m.</p>
<p>While the event is free, a parking permit must be purchased
