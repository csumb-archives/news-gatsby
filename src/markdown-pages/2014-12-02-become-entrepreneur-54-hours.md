<p>Ever wonder what it takes to be an entrepreneur? &#x2028;CSU Monterey
Bay will be a great place to find out when the university hosts
Startup Weekend Monterey Bay Jan. 23-25.<br>

will connect local entrepreneurs, developers, designers and startup
enthusiasts with mentors and resources. Throughout the course of
this 54-hour event, attendees will share ideas, form teams and
launch startups. &#x2028;<br>
&#x2028;<br>
&#x201C;Startup Weekend is a great way to get into entrepreneurship and
test it out, said Mary Jo Zenk, a member of the organizing team.
&#x201C;This event will foster an innovating environment for entrepreneurs
to share, vet and launch their ideas.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s how it works: The weekend opens with open mic pitches on
Friday, where attendees are encouraged to bring their best ideas
and inspire others to join their team. You don&apos;t have to have an
idea to attend. Teams form around the top ideas (as deemed by
popular vote) and then it&#x2019;s a 54-hour frenzy of business model
creation, coding, designing and market validation.</br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p class="pullquote">It&apos;s fantasy camp. At some point, haven&apos;t we
all imagined ourselves as Mark Zuckerberg?<br>

April 2013</br></br></p>
<p>On Sunday evening, teams demonstrate their prototypes in front
of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for
critical feedback.<br>
<br>
Startup veterans and mentors &#x2013; including faculty members and local
entrepreneurs &#x2013; will be on hand throughout the weekend to provide
expertise and give talks on their experiences.<br>
<br>
About 70 people participated in CSUMB&#x2019;s Startup Weekend in 2014.
With the help of 18 coaches and five judges, 10 companies were
formed over the weekend.</br></br></br></br></p>
<p>The event is organized by the College of Business&#x2019; <a href="http://innovation.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Institute for
Innovation and Economic Development.</a> The institute focuses on
the need for more job opportunities in the region and offers
programs that work toward developing entrepreneurs and supporting
innovative ideas that lead to new business opportunities.<br>
