campus. It takes only a few minutes and it really doesn&#x2019;t hurt.</img></p>
<p>It not only helps you, it also helps your family and everyone
with whom you come into contact. Yet more than half of adult
Americans fail to get a flu shot every year.</p>
<p>On Dec. 10, there&#x2019;s an easy way to remedy that situation.</p>
<p>The Monterey County Health Department, in collaboration with
CSUMB&#x2019;s Health and Wellness Services, will hold a free flu vaccine
clinic from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the west lounge of the Student
Center.</p>
<p>No appointment is necessary. The service is available for
students, staff, faculty, family members and the community.</p>
