College Opportunity Day of Action was intended to support President
Obama&#x2019;s commitment to partner with colleges and universities,
business leaders, and nonprofits to support students across the
country to help our nation reach its goal of leading the world in
college attainment.<br>
<br>
Participants were asked to commit to new action in one of four
areas: building networks of colleges around promoting completion,
creating K-16 partnerships around college readiness, investing in
high school counselors as part of the First Lady&#x2019;s Reach Higher
initiative, and increasing the number of college graduates in the
fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br>
<br>
CSUMB&#x2019;s commitment to increasing the number of graduates in STEM
fields involves its <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/csitin3/" rel="nofollow">CSIT-in-3
program</a> with Hartnell College. The program allows students to
earn a computer science degree in three years through year-round
study.</br></br></br></br></img></p>

designed around a cohort model, admitting 30&#x2010;35 students per
cohort. Eighty percent are first&#x2010;generation college students; 90%
are Latino; 43% are women. The first&#x2010;to&#x2010;second year retention of
the first cohort is 90%. California State University Monterey Bay
is currently investigating ways to replicate the program in other
STEM fields.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Increasing access to higher education is at the heart of the
mission of Cal State Monterey Bay, and is also central to our
nation&#x2019;s efforts to address issues of income inequality and
economic opportunity,&#x201D; Dr. Ochoa said.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;By sharing ideas among higher education and administration leaders
at this event, I hope we can continue to find ways to move these
initiatives forward.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Dr. Ochoa, who served as assistant secretary for higher education
in the Obama Administration before coming to CSUMB as president in
2012, was invited to the event by Cecilia Munoz, President Obama&#x2019;s
domestic policy adviser, and Secretary of Education Arne
Duncan.<br>
