<h3>It all comes down to this</h3>
<p>At CSU Monterey Bay, all students must complete a capstone
project in their final year, publicly presenting and defending the
project or portfolio of work that demonstrates what they have
learned. They do this each fall and spring at the Capstone
Festival, which is organized by academic departments.&#xA0;<br>

represent the skills, knowledge and abilities developed over the
course of a student&apos;s education at CSUMB. They include research
presentations, original poetry, oral histories, installation art,
photography, tabletop exhibits, films and videos, multimedia works,
computer visualizations and more.&#xA0;</img></br></br></p>

<p><strong>NEW THIS SEMESTER</strong><br>
Nursing students will present their capstone projects from 6 to
8:30 p.m. Dec. 18 in the Music Hall. The 10 members of the group
are part of the first nursing class at CSUMB. They completed three
semesters at the university, and then went back to local community
colleges to earn associate degrees in nursing last May. They
returned to CSUMB this fall to complete the bachelor of science in
nursing program.<br>
