Natives, the education and outreach arm of CSU Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
Watershed Institute, has a big idea for 2015.<br>
<br>
RON plans to transform parts of CSUMB&#x2019;s Seaside campus into a
living laboratory of learning and stewardship. It will invite the
public to help plant up to 3,000 native plants &#x2013; grown by students
and volunteers from Gateway and Hope centers &#x2013; on sites where
former Army buildings have been demolished. The work, to be done
during the rainy months of January, February and March, will help
to create an inviting campus.<br>
<br>
The project is part of Monterey County Gives, a year-end
fundraising campaign that supports local non-profit organizations.
The six-week campaign ends Dec. 31. <a href="https://www.montereycountygives.com/environment-sustainability/return-of-the-natives-restoration-education-project/" rel="nofollow">Donations to support &#xA0;Return of the Natives can
be made online.</a></br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>RON&apos;s environmental goal is to protect the waters of the
Monterey Bay through restoration of the waterways and the lands
draining in the bay. RON&apos;s social goal is to bring people and
nature together on restoration and garden projects in the
watersheds of the Monterey Bay.<br>
<br>
Over the past 20 years, more than 75,000 school children, 450 CSUMB
students, 6,500 youth and 1,300 Monterey County families have
worked with RON.</br></br></p>
