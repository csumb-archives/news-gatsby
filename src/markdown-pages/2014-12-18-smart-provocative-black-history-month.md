<p>From arts and culture year in review:</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is adept at celebrating diversity with
diversity. This one included a visit by Khleo Thomas, a teen idol
who&apos;s acted with Nick Cannon and Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, a
discussion of the n-word, and a tag-team poetry du, one of whom
worked with KRS-One.<br>
