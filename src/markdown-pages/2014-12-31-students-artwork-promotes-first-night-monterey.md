Monterey Bay student is gracing the marketing materials for First
Night Monterey &#x2013; the result of a longstanding relationship between
the university and the event&#x2019;s organizers.</img></p>
<p>The winning design was produced by Michael Plondaya, a biology
major who graduated last May.</p>
<p>&quot;I love learning about science, and insects have always filled
me with wonder and fascination,&quot; Plondaya said. He&apos;s also talented
at drawing and design, and plans to combine those interests by
enrolling in CSUMB&apos;s science illustration program.</p>
<p>Since 2004, students in Professor Long&#x2019;s Publication Workshop
class have created the First Night poster, buttons and ads.</p>
<p>The students had to design around this year&#x2019;s theme &#x2013;
SeaChanges, the Seaquel. According to the First Night website,
SeaChanges &#x201C;challenges us to see the changes we can make to &#x2018;sea&#x2019;
changes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Plondaya said his design &quot;represents all the new things that
could come from the New Year.&quot; It&apos;s also influenced by the &quot;arts
and crafts flavor of First Night and the marine environment that
surrounds and defines Monterey,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to Professor Long, &#x201C;These projects give students
real-world experience of working with a client and progressing
through various stages of the design process.</p>
<p>Publication Design is not an art class &#x201C;where students just have
a muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you
have to listen to our client, who tells you their needs and their
ideas, and you interpret that,&#x201D; she said.<br>
