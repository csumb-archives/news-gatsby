<h3>College students aren&#x2019;t the only ones being educated on the Cal
State Monterey Bay campus</h3>
<p>What do Hamlet, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and music&#x2019;s Romantic Period
have in common?</p>
<p>They are among a diverse range of classes that will be offered
in the spring through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute &#x2013; OLLI
&#x2013; at California State University, Monterey Bay. The courses and
speakers are specifically geared for those 50 and better.</p>
