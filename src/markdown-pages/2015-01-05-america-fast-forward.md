<h3>President&apos;s Speaker Series continues Jan. 30</h3>
<p>&#x201C;America Fast Forward?: Demographic Shifts, Economic Challenges,
and the Future of California&#x201D; will be the topic addressed by
University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor on Jan.
30, when the President&#x2019;s Speaker Series resumes at Cal State
Monterey Bay.</p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Manuel Pastor" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/mpastor_1.jpg" style="width:300px; height:452px; float:left">The social and
economic changes in California in the last few decades foreshadowed
what is now happening in the nation as a whole; indeed, the
demographic change in the state between 1980 and 2000 is what the
U.S. is projected to experience between 2000 and 2050.</img></p>
<p>In our passage, rising immigration, widening inequality, and a
strained fiscal system challenged the state (and now the nation),
but we are now at a critical turnaround as our demography
stabilizes, our economy catches its breath, and public finances are
finally on (slightly) firmer ground.</p>
<p>What&#x2019;s ahead for the Golden State? How do we ensure economic,
social and environmental sustainability for the next generation of
Californians? And what are the lessons for a nation experiencing
widening divides by income, geography and politics?</p>
<p>Dr. Pastor is a professor of sociology and American Studies
&amp; Ethnicity at USC. He directs the university&#x2019;s Program for
Environmental and Regional Equity and the Center for the Study of
Immigrant Integration. His research focuses on movement building
and the economic, environmental and social conditions facing
low-income communities.</p>
<p>He has written several books and speaks nationally on issues
including demographic change, economic inequality, and community
empowerment.</p>
<p>His presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on
Sixth Avenue near A Street. A question-and-answer session and a
public reception will follow. Driving directions and a campus map
are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps" rel="nofollow">here</a>. &#xA0;</p>
<p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are
necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling
the World Theater box office at 582-4580 or going <a href="http://csumb.edu/rsvp" rel="nofollow">online</a>.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#x2019;s speaker series is &#x201C;Future Monterey
Bay.&#x201D; During the school year, three speakers will visit campus to
address various aspects of the theme. The series kicked off in
November with a talk by Stanford University professor and futurist
Paul Saffo.</p>
<p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s
role as a community resource, providing forums for provocative
discussions that can impact thought and action on issues important
to our community.<br>
