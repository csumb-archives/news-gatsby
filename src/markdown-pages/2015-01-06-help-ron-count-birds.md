<p>Volunteers will be out at 7 a.m., Saturday, Jan. 17, looking for
hawks, geese, ducks, wrens and a variety of other species at the
Watershed Institute&#x2019;s 10th annual winter bird count at Upper Carr
Lake in Salinas. Everyone is welcome to help during the three-hour
count.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>

Laurel Drive between Constitution Boulevard and Sanborn Road, is a
resting stop for migratory birds. In 2014, volunteers from CSU
Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Return of the Natives project identified more than
70 species, including American coots, yellow-rumped warblers, a few
egrets and several varieties of hawks.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Participants will be provided with a data sheet on the birds of
Monterey County, published by the Monterey Peninsula Audubon
Society, and a pair of binoculars.<br>
<br>
&#x2028;&#x2028;After the bird count, volunteers are invited to help clean up the
lake from 10 a.m. to noon. Tools, water and snacks will be
provided.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We are happy to see that this growing environment fosters an
accommodating habitat for birds &#x2013; which emphasizes the purpose of
the second half of the morning &#x2013; to keep Upper Carr Lake clean and
healthy to keep the birds coming back,&#x201D; said Alyssa Schaan,
volunteer coordinator with Return of the Natives Restoration
Education Project.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
The local bird survey is one of 2,100 similar counts over the last
month. As many as 55,000 National Audubon Society volunteers from
Guam to Labrador and from Alaska to Chile slog through the woods,
find their way up mountains or look out their kitchen windows for
the squawking, quacking and tweeting flocks.&#x2028;&#x2028;<br>
<br>
Return of the Natives will submit the information it gathers to
California eBird, the Audubon Society&#x2019;s online database.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></p>
<p>The Return of the Natives restoration project is the education
and outreach branch of the Watershed Institute at CSUMB. RON&apos;s
environmental goal is to protect the waters of the Monterey Bay
through restoration of the waterways and the lands draining into
the bay. RON&apos;s social goal is to bring people and nature together
on its restoration and garden projects in the watersheds of the
Monterey Bay.<br>
