Aytes will be on display at the American Tin Cannery through March
31. The exhibit, &#x201C;Steinbeck: The Art of Fiction,&#x201D; features artistic
interpretations of John Steinbeck&#x2019;s work in sculpture, photography
and painting.</img></p>
<p>Aytes&#x2019; pieces are three-dimensional faces that represent his
visions of Steinbeck&#x2019;s characters.</p>
<p>Works by photographer Robert Nease and painter Warren Chang are
included in the exhibit, along with the Robert Lewis exhibit of
Cannery Row photographs from 1957-58.</p>
<p>The exhibit was created for the National Steinbeck Center by
Aytes and Nease, and displayed there last year. The current exhibit
has been expanded to include Chang&#x2019;s paintings of fieldworkers and
Lewis&#x2019; historic images of Cannery Row.</p>
<p>Aytes earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Sacramento State, where he
studied music performance and conducting, and an MBA in finance
from California Southern University. A re-entry student at CSUMB,
he earned a degree in Visual and Public Art in 2012.</p>
<p>On his <a href="http://www.lewaytes.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>, he says: &#x201C;In one form or another, art has
existed in my life as long as I have memory. My first conscious
production of art was musical . . . Music also transported me into
the medium of sculpture later in life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The exhibit is on display on the second floor of the American
Tin Cannery, 125 Ocean View Blvd., Pacific Grove. The building is
located around the corner from the Monterey Bay Aquarium.<br>
