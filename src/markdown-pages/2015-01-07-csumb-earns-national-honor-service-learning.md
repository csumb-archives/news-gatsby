<p>Cal State Monterey Bay&#x2019;s Service Learning program has earned
another honor.</p>
<p><img alt="Service Learning prism" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/service_learning.jpg" style="width:300px; height:225px; float:left">The university was
recently named to the President&#x2019;s Higher Education Community
Service Honor Roll for 2014. It is the highest federal honor
universities can receive for their commitment to service learning
and civic engagement.</img></p>
<p>The Corporation for National and Community Service launched the
President&#x2019;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll in 2006
to recognize institutions of higher learning that support
innovative and effective community service and service-learning
programs. Since the program&#x2019;s inception, CSUMB has been recognized
each year; it is the most decorated service learning program in the
country.</p>
<p>For 2014, CSUMB was recognized on the President&#x2019;s Honor Roll
with distinction for leadership in general community service and
economic opportunity. It was also honored in the category of
education.</p>
<p class="pullquote">At CSUMB, issues of service, diversity, social
justice and social responsibility are linked to the core
curriculum.</p>
<p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of a
few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all
students. Each year, nearly half of CSUMB students enroll in
service learning courses, contributing more than 65,000 hours of
service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and
government agencies in the tri-county area.&#xA0;</p>
<p>According to the Corporation for National and Community Service,
honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors,
including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent
to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the
school&#x2019;s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and
measurable community outcomes as a result of the service.</p>
