exhibit that invites spectators to take part by &#x201C;dressing to
transgress&#x201D; features the work of CSU Monterey Bay faculty
members.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;<a href="http://www.somarts.org/glamorgeddonopens/" rel="nofollow">Glamorgeddon: The Spectacle</a>,&#x201D; curated by Visual and
Public Art Department professors Johanna Poethig, Dio Mendoza and
Angelica Muro, is on display through Feb. 4 at the SOMArts Cultural
Center.</p>
<p>In Poethig&#x2019;s words, the exhibit &#x201C;celebrates how we choose to be
fabulous, even as we critique the excesses of our own endangered
species.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Poethig, a well-known muralist and performance artist, has
always been interested in the trappings&#xA0;<img alt="Johanna Poethig" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/johanna_poethig_0.jpg" style="width:310px; height:259px; float:right">of culture, media
and advertising. &#x201C;It was important for me to look more critically
at product-oriented culture and the ways media and the marketplace
have placed a huge burden on us, especially women, to look and act
a certain way,&#x201D; she told the San Francisco Chronicle.</img></p>
<p>Her own contribution to the show includes a series of bedazzled
hard hats, which are available for spectators to pose with.</p>
<p>The show features the work of more than 20 artists, including
Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains, professor emerita at CSUMB and former chair
of the Visual and Public Art Department. All works explore the
concept of &#x201C;glamour&#x201D; via visual art, mixed media and
performance.</p>
<p>A series of <a href="http://www.somarts.org/limolectures/" rel="nofollow">30-minute lectures</a> with some of the artists and
scholars will be held on Jan. 30 &#x2013; in a hot pink limousine.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.somarts.org" rel="nofollow">SOMArts
Cultural Center</a> is located at 934 Brannan St., between Eighth
and Ninth streets, in San Francisco. The exhibit will close on Feb.
4.&#xA0;<br>

Alumni John Elliott, Stephanie Sumler, Rachell Hester and Matt
