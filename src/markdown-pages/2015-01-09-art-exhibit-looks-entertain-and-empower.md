<p>A new art exhibit that invites spectators to take part in the
festivities by &quot;dressing to transgress&quot; is filling galleries,
stages and limousines. &quot;Glamorgeddon: The Spectacle,&quot; curated by
(CSUMB faculty members) Johanna Poethig, Angelica Muro and Hector
Dionicio, is nothing short of a sensory extravaganza . . .
