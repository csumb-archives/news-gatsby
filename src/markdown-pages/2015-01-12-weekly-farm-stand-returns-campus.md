<p>CSU Monterey Bay Dining Services is teaming up with the campus
Farm Club to bring a weekly farm stand to campus throughout the
fall.</p>

library from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. every Tuesday until late
November, the farm stand is open to the campus community and the
community-at-large. It&#x2019;s part of a commitment to sustainability and
healthy lifestyles.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;The purpose of bringing a farm stand to campus is to provide
students with the opportunity to purchase fresh local and organic
produce,&#x201D; said Tyler McBrian, retail manager for campus dining
services. This year, campus dining handed over running the stand to
the campus Farm Club.<br>
<br>
Each Tuesday, a student member of the Farm Club will purchase
produce directly from local farmers; it will be delivered to campus
for sale that day at the stand.&#x2028;&#x201C;We plan to pick different growers
to feature at the stand, with their stories and recipes using
produce that we&#x2019;re selling,&#x201D; said Stephanie Yee, a member of the
Farm Club.<br>
<br>
Students can use their meal plan to pay for their produce by
purchasing vouchers at Peet&#x2019;s. Customers can also pay with
cash.<br>
<br>
CSUMB joins a growing number of colleges that are finding that
campus farmers markets are a great fit, tapping into students&apos;
interest in sustaining the planet and eating a healthy diet.<br>
