<p>As publicity kicks in for the annual Together with Love 5 and
10K run, colorful posters are popping up around the local area.</p>
<p><img alt="Race logo" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/twl_2015_design_final.jpg" style="width:350px; height:248px; float:left">The artwork was
done by CSU Monterey Bay student Diana Mejia in Professor Bobbi
Long&#x2019;s introduction to digital graphic design class.</img></p>
<p>This is the fifth year the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center,
sponsor of the annual race that is held near Valentine&#x2019;s Day, has
worked with CSUMB to develop the logo that is used in marketing
materials &#x2013; in print ads, on television, online and on coffee mugs
&#x2013; and on the T-shirts given to race participants.</p>
<p>The challenge for students is to come up with a design that
combines the &#x201C;Together with Love&#x201D; theme, the date, MCRCC&#x2019;s full
name and the logo of the premier corporate sponsor, and
communicates the purpose of the event.</p>
<p>Clare Mounteer, the center&#x2019;s executive director, made several
visits to the class to introduce the project and work with the
students. &#x201C;I must have seen hundreds of different design concepts,&#x201D;
she said, adding that she enjoys seeing the many ways students
incorporate &#x201C;so much creativity into their work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Students vote on the top designs; those designs are then
presented to the MCRCC staff or board for final selection.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really fun to see how excited people get on race day when
they first see the T-shirts,&#x201D; Mounteer said, &#x201C;and gratifying for
the winning design student to see so many people actually wearing
their artwork.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We love this partnership with CSUMB and hope it goes on for
many years.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For three decades, the race has been the biggest annual
fundraising event for the Rape Crisis Center, a nonprofit agency
that advocates for and provides support for victims and survivors
of sexual assault. The center also works to prevent sexual violence
through education.</p>
<p>The MCRCC isn&#x2019;t the only community organization to benefit from
the talents of Professor Long&#x2019;s students. Members of her
publications design class have been designing the poster and
marketing materials for First Night Monterey since 2003.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These projects give students real-world experience working with
a client,&#x201D; Professor Long said. &#x201C;They learn business design
practices and project management and acquire advanced digital
production skills while creating professional quality projects for
community clients,&#x201D; she said.</p>
