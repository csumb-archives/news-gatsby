<p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has once
again honored CSU Monterey Bay for its focus on service and public
engagement, making it one of only 361 institutions in the United
States to hold the classification.</p>
<p><img alt="Community Engagement badge" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/carnegie_cec_digital_seal.jpg" style="width:300px; height:299px; float:left">The 2015 Community
Engagement Classification documents CSUMB&#x2019;s &#x201C;excellent alignment
among campus mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices
that support dynamic and noteworthy community engagement,&#x201D;
according to the foundation.<br>
<br>
Community engagement, as defined by the foundation, focuses on the
collaboration between institutions of higher education and their
larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of
knowledge and resources.<br>
<br>
&#x201C;We appreciate this recognition by the Carnegie Foundation,&#x201D; said
CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa.</br></br></br></br></img></p>
<p>&#x201C;Community engagement has been a cornerstone of CSUMB since our
founding and its importance has only grown over the years. We want
to continue to build on our tradition of service learning and to
seek new and meaningful ways to build partnerships that help move
our community forward,&#x201D; the president said.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed
the first <a href="http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu" rel="nofollow">classification system</a> for American colleges and
universities as a research tool to describe and represent the
diversity of U.S. higher education. The Community Engagement
category was first created in 2006, and the designation was awarded
to CSUMB that year. It is one indication of the growing importance
of community service and civic engagement as a priority for higher
education.&#xA0;<br>
<br>
<strong>About the university&#x2019;s community engagement
initiatives</strong><br>
&#x2028;CSUMB&apos;s community engagement initiatives are diverse and originate
from every academic program, emblematic of CSUMB&apos;s commitment to
active learning and its concern for its role as a &quot;steward of the
region.&quot;</br></br></br></p>
<p>CSUMB is one of the few universities in the nation &#x2013; public or
private &#x2013; to have made <a href="http://service.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">service learning</a> a graduation requirement for all
students. Through service learning, all CSUMB academic departments
and programs have been able to develop strong relationships
throughout the community.</p>
<p>Nearly half of CSUMB students enroll in service learning courses
each year, contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more
than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies
in the region.<br>
<br>
A few examples of the university&#x2019;s outstanding accomplishments in
service learning and community engagement include:</br></br></p>
<p>&#x2022; CSUMB&apos;s <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/programs/chinatown-renewal-project" rel="nofollow">Chinatown Renewal Project</a>, which involves over 100
students each year in the revitalization of Chinatown neighborhood
in Salinas;</p>
<p>&#x2022; <a href="http://ron.csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">Return of the
Natives</a> environmental restoration project, which works with
over 60 students in various environmental efforts;</p>
<p>&#x2022; The <a href="http://seafloor.otterlabs.org" rel="nofollow">Seafloor Mapping Project</a>, which develops detailed
