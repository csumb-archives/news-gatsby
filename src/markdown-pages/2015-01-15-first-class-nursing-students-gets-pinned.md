history-making Cal State Monterey Bay graduates, it&#x2019;s not about the
caps and gowns. It&#x2019;s all about the pin.</img></p>
<p>CSUMB&#x2019;s first class of 10 nursing graduates participated in a
pinning ceremony on Dec. 20. Commencement will follow in May.</p>
<p><img alt="CSUMB pin" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/bsnpin_for_web.jpg" style="width:300px; height:298px; float:left">&#x201C;The ceremony is a
tradition in nursing, where graduates receive a pin unique to that
program,&#x201D; said Dr. Marianne Hultgren, director of nursing at CSUMB.
&#x201C;It dates back to the days of Florence Nightingale, when a pin was
a way to identify a nurse.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>Students in the program designed the pin, which can be worn
throughout a nurse&#x2019;s career.</p>
<p>The ceremony marked an important milestone not just for the
students, but also for the university. A nursing program was
discussed in CSUMB&#x2019;s early days. Funded by a grant, planning
started in 2008; the first students were admitted four years
later.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As a pioneer, I feel like I have helped lay the foundation for
future nursing classes,&#x201D; said Jennifer Riccobono. &#x201C;The students in
our graduating class have set the bar high.&#x201D;<br>
<br>
Riccobono wasn&#x2019;t aware of the possibilities in the profession until
she entered the program.</br></br></p>
<p>&#x201C;Nursing is not just caring for the patient at the bedside.
Nursing is caring for whole communities; nursing is using
technology so that the patient information we collect can be used
in a meaningful way. Nursing is working to create health care
policies that will benefit generations to come,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>CSUMB offers the only bachelor of science in nursing degree in
the tri-county region. The program started in 2012 in collaboration
with four regional community colleges. Students begin their
education at one of the two-year schools, spend time in a &quot;blended&quot;
learning environment, and then complete their studies at CSUMB.
They receive an associate degree in nursing from their community
college and a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) from CSUMB.</p>

2014, a second track was added that allows already-employed nurses
with associate&#x2019;s degrees to earn a BSN while continuing to work.
Classes are offered on campus, online and at local hospitals to
make it easier for working nurses.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;The one thing I know for sure about our graduating class is no
matter what nursing position we fill in the community, we will put
our patient&#x2019;s needs first and strive to make positive changes in
health care,&#x201D; Riccobono said.<br>
