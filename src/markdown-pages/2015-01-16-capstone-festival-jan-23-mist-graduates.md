capstone project will help her fellow students prepare for graduate
school. Michael Stewart aims to help recovering addicts maintain
sobriety. And Deborah Stephens is teaching community college
students how to use the resources of their campus library.</img></p>
<p>The three will join 10 classmates in presenting their projects
at the Capstone Festival for the Master&#x2019;s in Instructional Science
and Technology (MIST) program at Cal State Monterey Bay. The
festival will be held from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., Jan. 23, in Room 118
of the Media Learning Center. Driving directions and a campus map
are available at csumb.edu/maps.</p>
<p>The 16-month program prepares students for positions in the
fields of education and training. The coursework integrates
instructional design, learning theory, information technology and
media design.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I enjoyed the program; it&#x2019;s been a great experience,&#x201D; said
Callie Chastain, an analyst in CSUMB&#x2019;s School of Business. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s
been hugely advantageous for me.&#x201D; For her capstone, Chastain
designed online modules for use by incoming students in the
university&#x2019;s Master of Business Administration program.</p>
<p>Students will receive their degrees at the May 16 commencement
ceremony.</p>
