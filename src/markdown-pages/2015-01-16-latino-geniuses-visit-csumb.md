<h3>Award-winners hope to inspire students</h3>
<p>The MacArturos &#x2013; well, some of them &#x2013; are coming to Cal State
Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Each year since 1981, the MacArthur Foundation has given
no-strings-attached grants to individuals who show exceptional
merit and promise of continued creative work. The recipients come
from all fields. The awards have become known as &#x201C;genius
grants.&#x201D;</p>

banded together as the MacArturos, with the goal of supporting each
other&#x2019;s activist efforts and sharing their work with <em>la
comunidad</em>, according to the website of writer Sandra Cisneros,
who organized the first meeting in San Antonio in 1997.</img></p>
<p>The group originally came together as a reunion, to inspire
Latino youth. Over the years, meetings have been held in San Jose,
Los Angeles, Toledo and Chicago.</p>
<p>Ten Latino MacArthur Fellows will visit CSUMB on Jan. 26. In a
roundtable format at the World Theater, they will provide insight
into their influences, inspirations and practices.</p>
<p>Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains, a retired faculty member at CSUMB and a
1992 MacArthur Fellow, invited the group to campus.</p>

have wanted to have the MacArturos come here because I know they
will be inspirational for our students &#x2013; the majority of whom are
the first in their family to attend college, and more than a third
of whom are Latino,&#x201D; Dr. Mesa-Bains said.</img></p>
<p>&#x201C;I think they are engaging for all students, but serve as
special role models for our Latino students.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The free event will start at 6 p.m. in the World Theater on
Sixth Avenue near A Street. The public is invited.</p>
<p>The group will participate in a public event in Salinas before
heading to campus. The next day, they will travel to San Francisco
for events in the Mission District.</p>
