<h3>Super Sunday encourages more students to enroll</h3>
<p>Parishioners at two local churches will get more than a sermon
at the Feb. 8 services. They&#x2019;ll get a pitch for the value of a
college education &#x2013; straight from the pulpit.</p>
<p>Cal State Monterey Bay administrators will visit churches in
Seaside that day as part of a California State University program
called Super Sunday.</p>
<p>At 11:15 a.m., Vice President For Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs
is scheduled to address the congregation at Greater Victory Temple.
At 11 a.m., Associate Vice President for University Affairs Andre
Lewis will speak at Bethel Missionary Baptist Church.<br>

the importance of getting a college degree for today&#x2019;s competitive

CSUMB, financial aid and parent involvement.</img></br></br></p>
<p>Following the services, staff members from CSUMB and church
education advisers will provide information on the application and
admission process, including virtual tours through CSUmentor, the
website that helps students apply for college.</p>
<p>One of the publications to be distributed during the visits is
the &#x201C;How to Get to College&#x201D; poster, which provides middle and high
school students and their parents with step-by-step information on
the path to college. Members of each congregation also will hear
about the CSU&#x2019;s Early Assessment Program, a program enabling 11th
graders to gauge their college readiness in English and math long
before applying to the CSU.</p>
<p>Now in its 10th year, Super Sunday is part of an educational
outreach led by the CSU African American Initiative &#x2013; a partnership
with churches &#x2013; to increase college preparation, student enrollment
and graduation rates among African American students. More than 100
churches will host CSU representatives on Feb. 8, 15 and 22.</p>
