<h3>Preview set for Feb. 13</h3>
<p>This year&#x2019;s canonization of Father Serra may help filmmaker Doug
Mueller.</p>
<p>Mueller (TAT, 2003) is seeking support to complete a documentary
film on the restoration and seismic retrofit of the Carmel Mission
Basilica. Father Serra founded the mission and is buried there.</p>
<p><img alt="Carmel Mission restoration is subject of alum&apos;s documentary" src="http://news.csumb.edu/sites/default/files/65/attachments/news/images/carmel_mission_restoration_main_476x268.jpg" style="width:400px; height:225px; float:right">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m hoping to get
it funded so it can be finished by September,&#x201D; Mueller said.
&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a big incentive now, before Father Serra is sainted and
people flock to the mission.&#x201D;</img></p>
<p>According to the Carmel Mission Foundation, which hired Mueller,
an important part of the basilica&#x2019;s restoration is his record of
the project. The film examines the daily construction work over a
six-month period and highlights the most complex tasks as they
change over time. People who worked on the project discuss the
challenges of restoring one of the oldest and most historically
significant buildings in California.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Film Society is providing fiscal oversight,
which allows donations to be tax deductible. <a href="http://www.sffs.org/filmmaker360/documentary-grants-and-programs/project-development-and-fiscal-sponsorship/carmel-mission-restoration#.VMFCPf06BDM" rel="nofollow">Learn more about the documentary here</a>.</p>

documentary will be screened at a preview from 5 to 6:30 p.m., Feb.
13, in Crespi Hall, located behind the mission on Lasuen Drive.</img></p>

directed. Watch the trailer here.</p>
<p>His film <a href="../../../2010/dec/15/another-csumb-alum-goes-indie-sundance.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Prairie Love,</em></a> a dark comedy about a
nomad traveling the rural roads of North Dakota, had its world
premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011.&#xA0;</p>
