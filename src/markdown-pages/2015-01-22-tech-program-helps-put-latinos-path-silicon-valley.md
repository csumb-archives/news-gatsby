<p>About an hour south of Silicon Valley in a classroom at Hartnell
Community College, Daniel Diaz and Brian De Anda stand at a
whiteboard mapping out ideas n how to reduce the size of a mobile
app their team is building. They&apos;re part of the inaugural class of
CSIT-in-3, an intensive, accelerated computer science degree
program targeted at students from the agricultural Salinas Valley.
The program is a collaboration between the community college and
CSU Monterey Bay.<br>
