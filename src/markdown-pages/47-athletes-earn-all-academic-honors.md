<p>Nearly four dozen CSUMB student-athletes earned California Collegiate Athletic Association All-Academic honors, a reminder that Otter success extended beyond the arean of athletic competition in 2010-11.
</p><p>A total of 451 student-athletes from the 12 conference institutions were named CCAA All–Academic winners, an average of 37 per school – putting CSUMB ahead of the curve with 47.
</p><p>“Being strong competitors in the classroom is one of Otter Athletics' top priorities,” said CSUMB Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.
</p><p>“We have stated this fact a number of times and we are proving that commitment with our actions, successes and awards. CSUMB and Otter Athletics are extremely proud of our student-athletes and their continued successful pursuit of academic 'victories.' ”
</p><p>Student-athletes must meet several stringent criteria to be eligible for CCAA All–Academic recognition, including being an active varsity letter winner in one of the 13 CCAA sports and accumulating a grade point average of at least 3.40 in a minimum of 24 credits during the academic year.
</p><p>Four Otters made the list with perfect 4.0 GPAs: golfer D.J. Milligan of Cedar Ridge; soccer player Ashley Rohde of Scotts Valley; cross country runner Hayley Tharp of San Jose; and baseball player Tyler Young of Aiea, Hawaii.
</p><p>Also noteworthy – the Otter triumvirate of James Albert of San Bernardino, Brenden Fripp of Santa Barbara and Brandon Ward of Riverside made CSUMB the only school to place three men's basketball players on the list.
</p><p>Overall, only UC San Diego (84) had more honorees than the Otters.
