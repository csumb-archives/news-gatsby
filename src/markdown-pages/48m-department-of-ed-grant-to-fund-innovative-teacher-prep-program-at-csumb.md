  <b>SEASIDE, Ca., October 8, 2019 –</b> California State University Monterey
  Bay (CSUMB) has been selected to receive funding under the U.S. Department of
  Education’s Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program in the amount of
  $4,849,320; $2.2M of which will go directly to student scholarships.
</p>
<p>
  The award, expected to span over a total of five years, will also help fund a
  project entitled Preparing Observational Practitioners through Partnerships
  Yearlong (POPPY) and support CSUMB partnerships with eight school districts
  across Monterey County, further advancing the “grow your own” model of teacher
  preparation.
</p>
<p>
  Project POPPY aims to increase achievement among K-12 students by preparing
  highly-qualified prospective teachers through rigorous curriculum reform, a
  yearlong clinical residency model and sustained intensive professional
  development opportunities in both STEM and literacy fields. Project POPPY has
  five goals centered around:
</p>
<p>
  “We greatly appreciate this funding from the U.S. Department of Education for
  a program designed to meet the diverse needs of CSUMB students and our partner
  districts,” said Project POPPY principal investigator and CSUMB
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/teach">Department of Education and Leadership</a>
  assistant professor Erin Ramirez. “The scholarships will support CSUMB
  students that may not have otherwise been able to obtain a master's degree,
  while committing to teach in our high-needs partner districts. Through this
  funding we will be able to provide support to our faculty for curricular
  reform and research that will not only improve our teacher preparation
  programs, but provide the supports needed to improve the educational outcomes
  of K-12 students throughout Monterey County.”
</p>
<p>
  Expected outcomes of Project POPPY include recruiting teachers from
  underrepresented populations and high-needs content areas; increasing the
  number of highly-qualified teachers entering the field so that partner
  districts can hire and retain effective new teachers; supporting new teacher
  retention and effectiveness; expanding teacher knowledge around STEM practices
  and integrating literacy across the content areas to improve student
  achievement and reduce the number of Long Term English Learners.

  Programs such as Project POPPY directly support the CSU

  opportunity to be successful and graduate according to their personal goals,
  positively impacting their future and producing additional graduates to power
  California and the nation.
</p>
<p>
  The TQP program is authorized under Title II of the Higher Education Act with
  the purpose of improving student achievement, elevating the quality of the
  teacher workforce by enhancing preparation of prospective teachers and
  professional development of new teachers, and recruiting highly qualified
  individuals into the teacher workforce.
