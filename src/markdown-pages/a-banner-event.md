<h2>{}</h2><p>"Vision," "diversity" and "service" are boldly displayed on banners that grace campus.
</p><p>They are among the seven words chosen for display on the banners – excellence, innovation, partnership and community are the others – that replaced the original green and yellow ones.
</p><p>In all, 60 blue, green and white banners have been installed around campus
</p><p>The words were chosen to reflect the core values and attributes of CSU Monterey Bay, said Scott Faust, the university's executive director for strategic communications.
</p><p>The old banners showed the university's web address. "While the website is an important communication tool, we thought people are search-oriented and we could use the space for something else – as a way to emphasize our values for the campus community and the larger community," Faust said.
</p><p>Faust noted that the way-finding signs on campus have been replaced and some of the directional signs were changed to reflect a new traffic pattern.
</p><p>"We looked at each of the directional signs to see how they were routing traffic through campus," Faust explained. "The long-range plan is to bring traffic to campus from Highway 1 via Second Avenue and Inter-Garrison Road."
