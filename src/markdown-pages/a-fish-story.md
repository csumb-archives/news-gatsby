<h3>Interns help to rescue 40,000 steelhead</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay students help the local community in a variety of ways, as interns and service learners.
</p><p>Recently, undergrads and graduate students from the <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/sep/">Division of Science and Environmental Policy</a> helped in an unusual way – with the annual steelhead rescue on the Carmel River.
</p><p>The Monterey Peninsula Water Management District’s steelhead rescue teams worked through the spring and summer to save over 40,000 fish from drying sections of the river and move them to a facility where they could grow until river flows reach adequate levels for their release in the winter.
</p><p>Helping with the rescue were CSUMB student interns pursuing degrees in science and biology. The students learned about fish rearing, data collection and water quality monitoring while serving the community.
</p><p>“Our environmental science and graduate students have worked with the district on a large number of projects through the years,” said Dr. Doug Smith, department chair and professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy.
</p><p>“The jobs our students get can commonly be traced to additional skills they learned or honed with the Water District,” Dr. Smith said.
</p><p>Evan DeLay, a student in the professional science master’s program in <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/cwsp/psm.htm">Applied Marine and Watershed Science</a>, is typical of the students who work with the district.
</p><p>His degree program required him to serve an internship. DeLay chose to do that with the water management district as a water resources assistant. His duties include collecting water quality data at various locations along the Carmel River and analyzing temperature trends in the surface water.
</p><p>DeLay worked with the fish rescue operation and is now reviewing film taken in the lower Carmel River to count how many steelhead move up and downstream.
