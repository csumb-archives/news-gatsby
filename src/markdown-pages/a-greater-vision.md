<p>HOW IS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMING AGRIBUSINESS?</p><p>The “Greater Vision” series of forums addressing issues facing the agricultural industry continues Nov. 5 at California State University, Monterey Bay. The program is designed for professionals, students and community members who are interested in the future of agriculture.
</p><p>The broad theme to be examined over the next three years is technology. This year’s topic is Emergent Technologies: How is Technology Transforming Agribusiness? Technology’s impact on energy and water use will be examined in years two and three of the series.

The series is intended to build a continuing conversation from the Forbes AgTech Summit held in Salinas last July. That event was part of an effort to merge the technological expertise of Silicon Valley with local agriculture.
</p><p>Tom Rolander will deliver the keynote address. Rolander, who works for AgSoft Consulting, is a former CIO/software architect for Ecopia Farms, an indoor urban vertical farm in Silicon Valley.
</p><p>A panel discussion will follow the keynote address. Panelists include Kevin Murphy, chief executive officer of Driscoll’s; Lorri Koster, CEO of Mann Packing; and Dr. Bob Whitaker, chief science and technology officer at the Produce Marketing Association. Dennis Donohue, president of Royal Rose, will serve as facilitator.
</p><p>The event will be held in the <a href="https://csumb.edu/maps">University Center</a>, on Sixth Avenue at B Street, starting at 9 a.m. The forum is free, but visitors will need to purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot.
</p><p>New this year is an expo that will showcase ag tech companies. Reserve a space at the expo <a href="http://greatervision2015.eventbrite.com">here</a>.
</p><p>“A Greater Vision” is sponsored by the Grower&#45;Shipper Association Foundation and CSUMB. The forums are intended to provide information from diverse points of view.
