<h3>Why are we afraid of the dark?</h3><p>Excerpts from “A History of the Body,” a new work by Aimee Suzara, will be staged at CSU Monterey Bay on April 18.
</p><p>The production is part of the university’s celebration of Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month.
</p><p>“A History of the Body,” directed by Pamela Wu Kochiyama and co-produced by The Pagbabalik Project and Third Root Productions, is about what happens to two women who meet in a beauty salon. The play addresses modern-day attitudes toward beauty and skin tone for Filipina women and women of color, the global rise in the use of skin-whitening products, and the historical events and stereotypes about people of color perpetuated at the turn of the century.
</p><p>Following the performance, Suzara and writer/scholar Lisa Marie Rollins will discuss what went into creating this provocative work. Afterward, the audience will have the opportunity to talk with the director and cast.
</p><p>The production will take place at 7:30 p.m. in the World Theater. The event is free, but visitors must purchase a $2 parking permit. The theater is located on Sixth Avenue near B Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>CSUMB’s Special Events Committee, Division of Humanities and Communication, Otter Cross Cultural Center and the NAACP are sponsors of the event.
