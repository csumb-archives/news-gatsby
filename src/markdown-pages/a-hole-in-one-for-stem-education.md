  Cal State Monterey Bay students recently got hands-on experience teaching
  scientific concepts such as Archimedes’ principle and Newton’s theory of
  gravity through their application to golf.

  The future teachers served as mentors in the Chevron STEM Zone, an interactive
  exhibit that highlights the scientific side of sports through a variety of
  hands&#45;on learning stations for youngsters. The idea is that sports can
  make science more engaging. When the STEM Zone made a stop at the Nature
  Valley First Tee Open golf tournament at Pebble Beach Sept. 24&#45;27, three
  dozen CSUMB students worked with 1,300 elementary, middle and high school
  students over the four days of the tournament. The STEM Zone travels to
  sporting events throughout the state. At nearly every stop, CSU students from
  that area are invited to serve as exhibit mentors. Faculty members prepare
  them to highlight scientific and engineering practices, depending on the
  sport. A $1 million grant from Chevron has helped to develop the CSU’s teacher
  training programs for science, technology, engineering and math.
