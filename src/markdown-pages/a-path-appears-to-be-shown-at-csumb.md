<p>TWO SCREENINGS SET FOR OCT. 23</p>
<p>
  In the documentary, A Path Appears, the subject is gender oppression, violence
  and solutions. The subtext is how everything is connected: domestic violence,
  poverty, sex trafficking . . . It’s not easy to watch, but it carries an
  important message.
</p>
<p>
  Based on a book by journalists Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn,
  <em>A Path Appears</em> tracks celebrity activists including Jennifer Garner,
  Ashley Judd, Eva Longoria and Alfre Woodard to Colombia, Haiti, Kenya and
  throughout the U.S. The third episode of the documentary, Violence and
  Solutions, will be shown at CSU Monterey Bay Oct. 23, in the World Theater.
  The free screening is sponsored by the Domestic Violence Coordinating Council
  of Monterey County, CSUMB’s Police Department and the World Theater. The
  film’s approach is intentionally upbeat, highlighting the successes, offering
  hope, and affirming that there are opportunities and it is possible to
  transform lives. The message is one of empowerment: “Our future is in the
  hands of women everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
  The film will be shown at 4 p.m. and will be followed by a panel discussion
  with Deputy District Attorney Elaine McCleaf, YWCA Executive Director Cheryl
  McCormick and Monterey County Rape Crisis Center rape prevention educator
  Corrina Hatzidakis. The film will be screened again at 7:15. While the
  screening is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit. Community Service
  Officers will be on hand to assist visitors. For information or to request
