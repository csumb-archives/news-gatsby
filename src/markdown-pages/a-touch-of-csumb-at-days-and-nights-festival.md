<p>Philip Glass’ Days and Nights Festival returns to the local area Sept. 25-28, with a big contribution from CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Enid Baxter Ryce, chair of CSUMB’s Cinematic Arts Department, has planned the daytime portion of the festival, putting together a lineup of films, an animation and puppet workshop, talks and a social event, all free to the public.
</p><p>At noon on the festival’s opening day, Sept. 25, filmmaker Godfrey Reggio will talk about and screen his short film <em>Evidence</em> – which is scored with music by Glass.
</p><p>Jaron Lanier, classical music composer, computer scientist and one of <em>Time</em> magazine’s 100 most influential people, will also speak at the screening.
</p><p>The event will be held in the Cinematic Arts studio on campus. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>On Saturday, Sept. 27, Sunset Center hosts a screening of <em>H20 MX</em>, a widely praised documentary about water issues in Mexico City. Compared to <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> in its attempt to raise awareness, the film makes an urgent plea for action. A discussion with the filmmakers will follow.
</p><p>At 4 p.m., Soyeon Kim, a professor of animation at CSUMB, will lead a spaceship-themed puppet and animation workshop in Sunset Center’s lobby, followed at 6 p.m. by a pizza party for youngsters.
</p><p>On the festival’s final day, Sept. 28, Professor Ryce will present Planet Ord History and Ecology – a collection of CSUMB student films that explore Fort Ord from a variety of angles. Showtime is 1 p.m.
</p><p>In 2013, the CSUMB-based Monterey Bay Film Festival became part of the Days and Nights Festival; its role is to create daytime film programming and workshops to compliment the evening events.
