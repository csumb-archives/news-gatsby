<p>In a large conference room at Graniterock's headquarters in Watsonville, 54 Rolling Hills Middle School students are voluntarily spending a week of their winter break studying algebra and to the casual observer, they're having fun. Taught by a team of mathematics professors and students from CSUMB, the Algebra Academy give the students six hours per day of math instruction in what organizers hope is a relaxed atmosphere without the threat of quizzes looming over their heads.  â€” <em>Watsonville Register-Pajaronian</em>, Jan. 6, 2011
