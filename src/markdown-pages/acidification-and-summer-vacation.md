<h3>Students work on research projects</h3><p><em>Not too many undergraduates can say they have been fortunate enough to do research. Even fewer can say they’ve been a part of research going into their junior year. And only one can say he’s been a part of a research project between Moss Landing Marine Labs and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</em>
</p><p><em>My name is Alex Neu, and I’m that student.</em> – Blog post on June 18, 2012  
</p><p>For some college students, summer is a time to put the books away for a few months and kick back.
</p><p>That’s not the case for dozens of CSU Monterey Bay students involved with the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center or UROC. Those students – including Alex Neu – are spending their summers conducting experiments, gathering data and summarizing their findings in research papers.
</p><p>They are spread out across the United States. Many are working in labs on other university campuses and at research centers; one is interning with a certified public accountant; and some are working on projects based at CSUMB.
</p><p>And while most are majoring in a field of science, at least a dozen are pursuing degrees – and research topics – in psychology, business, global studies, human communication, music and math.
</p><p>Alex is spending the summer researching the effects of climate change on rocky reef communities in La Jolla as part of a Sea Grant-funded project. Among his daily activities, he monitors pH levels in various samples.
</p><p>He’s looking at how ocean acidification affects two species of algae, one native and one invasive.
</p><p>“We’re excited to see what kind of results we’ll find. Will one species fare better than the other? What implications could this have for an invasive species’ ability to outcompete a native in a changing ocean environment?,” he asks in his blog post.
</p><p>Another UROCer, Mitchell Takata, is also spending part of his summer down south. Takata is working with Dr. Corey Garza at the University of Southern California’s Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island. They are investigating the value of incorporating intertidal habitat into the design of Marine Protected Areas for spiny lobster and sheephead.
</p><p>Mitchell “has handled 4 a.m. low tide habitat surveys and 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. high tide snorkel surveys for lobsters,” Dr. Garza said. “There were even a couple of SCUBA surveys thrown in there as well.
</p><p>“And he’s been a big help to the two graduate students in my lab,” Dr. Garza said.
