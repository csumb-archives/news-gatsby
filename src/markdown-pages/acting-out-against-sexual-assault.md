<p>Call it an innovative approach to tackling a sensitive subject.
</p><p>On Sept. 2, an acting troupe, Catharsis Productions, will make its first appearance at CSU Monterey Bay in a production called “<a href="http://www.catharsisproductions.com/sexsignals.php">Sex Signals</a>.”
</p><p>It’s a series of skits and guided discussions led by a pair of specially trained actors who demonstrate that role-playing and blunt talk make more memorable sexual assault training than lectures.
</p><p>The goal of the 90-minute presentation is to broaden awareness about dating, sex and the core issue of consent using improvisation, humor and audience participation to get the message across.
</p><p>Over the last 15 years, “Sex Signals” has been performed approximately 5,000 times to more than 2 million people, mostly on college campuses and military installations. Members of the community are invited to attend the free presentation at 7:30 p.m., Sept. 2, in the University Center ballroom. The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here.</a> While the presentation is free, a parking permit is required and can be purchased from a machine on the lot or <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy-permit">online</a>.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by Associated Students; CSUMB’s Office of Student Activities and Leadership Development; and the Title IX Coordinators’ Office.
