<p>The CSUMB Emergency Management Health and Safety division of the University Police Department now provides more than 70 Automated External Defibrillator &#40;AED&#41; units across campus, nearly one in every building.  With an AED located within walking distance from any location on campus, students and employees are encouraged to complete a free AED/CPR training to become certified in AED and Cardio&#45;Pulmonary Resuscitation &#40;CPR&#41; use.
</p><p>The certification course prepares users to perform life&#45;saving adult, pediatric and infant CPR and AED procedures in the event of a cardiac emergency. While employees and students are not required to use these live&#45;saving devices, all are encouraged to learn about their use to ensure rapid response in case of an emergency.
</p><p>“The AED units use simple audio and visual commands to ensure successful application by any person,” said campus health and safety specialist Arianne Tucker. “It is important to get familiar with the AED unit and locations to ensure you’re ready to act in case of an emergency. You should also encourage your friends and coworkers to learn about AED procedures in case it’s you who is in need of assistance.”
</p><p>The expansion of the AED program was made possible with funding from the Student Fee Advisory Committee. The free training is offered monthly through UPD and taught by the POM Fire Department.
