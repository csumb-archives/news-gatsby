</p><p>The performance features master Afro-Peruvian musician Pedro Rosales and his group, Proyecto Landó, an ensemble of 10 musicians and four dancers. With elements of jazz and salsa, the group provides a colorful and powerful swing that makes people want to dance – and attendees will have the chance to do just that.
</p><p>The evening includes an opportunity to talk with Rosales and his group about the music, the history of blacks in Peru, the relative influence of Afro-Peruvian culture in the three main regions of Peru (coast, mountain and Amazon), and the importance of black Peru within the wider African Diaspora.
</p><p>The performance will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Black Box Cabaret, located adjacent to the Health and Wellness Services building on Inter-Garrison Road and Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Best place to park is the lot in front of Health and Wellness Services.
</p><p>While the concert is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine in the lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here.</a>
