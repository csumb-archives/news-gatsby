<p>It's tough not to be dazzled by "Glamorgeddon: the Spectacle," on view until Feb. 4 in SOMArts' Main Gallery. The group exhibition curated by Bay Area artist Johanna Poethig, along with Angelica Muro and Hector Dionicio Mendoza, brings together work from over 20 artists &#40;including Amalia Mesa&#45;Bains&#41; and performers in SOMArts' first of three Commons Curatorial Residency exhibitions.
