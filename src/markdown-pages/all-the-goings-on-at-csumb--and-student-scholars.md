<p>There's film, there's theater, there's provocative speakers, there's just so much going on at CSUMB. In between all the events, students do have time to do research. Five student projects will represent the university at the 26th annual CSU Student Research Competition at Long Beach State May 4 and 5. â€“ <em>Monterey Herald</em>, April 11, 2012
