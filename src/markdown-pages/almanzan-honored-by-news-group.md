</p><p>KAZU news director Krista Almanzan was honored Nov. 7 by the Radio&#45;Television News Directors Association of Northern California at the organization's annual awards dinner in San Francisco.
</p><p>She was recognized in the category of best feature reporting on a serious subject for "A Second Chance in Salinas." The story examined a program called Take the Lead, which pairs at&#45;risk youngsters with dogs surrendered to the local SPCA. The kids learn to train the dogs – making the pets more adoptable – while making a better connection with their school and doing better in the classroom.
