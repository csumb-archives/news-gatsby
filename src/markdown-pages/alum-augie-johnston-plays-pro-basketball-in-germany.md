<p>This year marks Augie Johnston’s second year playing professional basketball in Germany.
</p><p>Johnston, a former Cal State Monterey Bay basketball player and two-year starter for the Otters, graduated from CSUMB in 2009 with a degree in business. Last season he played for Germany’s Velbert Baskets, a team in the northwestern part of Germany. This year he’s stepping up his game and has signed with Germany’s Rattlesdorf Independents, a league one level higher than the Baskets located in the southwestern region. “Unless you are a high-profile Division I player, you are going to have to start at a low-level team and prove yourself,” Johnston said. “So I am very happy I was able to do that, and I hope I can move up once again after this season.” This can-do attitude is classic Johnston. While at CSUMB, the Atascadero native showed exemplary leadership ability as the assistant coach during the 2008-09 season, mentoring and supporting his team as they reached the CCAA tournament. “You really have to dedicate yourself to whatever dream you have,” he said.
</p><p>Johnson hopes to coach basketball at the junior college level once he returns from Germany. “People who know me know that I was on a mission to make this happen from day one,” he said, “and I never took a day off.”
