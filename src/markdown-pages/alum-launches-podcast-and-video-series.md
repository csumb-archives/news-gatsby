<p>Ed Carapezza (TAT ’13) has launched the National Music Sanctuary, a podcast and video series.
</p><p>Students and faculty member Lanier Sammons of CSUMB’s Music and Performing Arts Department, and Scott Grover of the Golden State Theatre are working with his company, Dangerbag Productions.
</p><p>Local musicians as well as those traveling through the Central Coast perform short sets, which are recorded by students in the university’s recording technology program and video is shot. The final product is <a href="http://sharedvisionfilms.com/post/49519527904/dangerbag-is-proud-to-present-another-video">posted online</a>.
</p><p>The first session took place in March with Steven Griswold and the California Convey, a honky-tonk band from Santa Cruz. That 21-minute video is now available online. Another session took place in April and featured a San Francisco band, Beso Negro. Folk musician Greg Brown is lined up for the third episode.
</p><p>“The National Music Sanctuary is growing,” Carapezza said. “We’re going from one podcast a month to two.
</p><p>“We’ve enlisted the support of another venue, Rumble Seat Music of Carmel. Using the backdrop of vintage priceless guitars, we’re sure to garner more acclaim.”
</p><p>Upcoming acts include Iris Dement, the Blue Tail Flies from Santa Cruz, and the Lady Crooners, another Santa Cruz group.
</p><p>The music project is just one of the things Carapezza is focusing on.
</p><p>He’s also continuing to work on Shared Vision, a documentary series on artist communities around the world. It grew out of his capstone film in 2011, which tells the story of life at Project Artaud, a San Francisco artist community. That led to Prepping for Frescomania, a short film that was shown at San Francisco’s de Young Museum last fall as a companion piece to Javier Manrique’s stint as artist-in-residence at the museum.
</p><p>The 43-year-old Carapezza has taken a circuitous route to where he is now – he worked in Hollywood as a grip and electrician and on the East Coast in construction; he studied at CSUMB, left and came back.
</p><p>When he’s not working in the editing bays at TAT, he’s in the Music Department’s recording studio, implementing his seemingly endless supply of ideas.
