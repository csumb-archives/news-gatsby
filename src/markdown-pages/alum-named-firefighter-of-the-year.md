  Anthony Prado (TMAC ’00) has been recognized with the Career Firefighter of
  the Year Award by the Monterey County Fire Chiefs Association.

  Prado always knew he wanted to be a firefighter. Now a fire engineer with the
  Marina department, Prado spent years in Silicon Valley working for Cisco
  before he made his dream a reality. He returned to school and attended the
  Monterey Peninsula College Fire Academy in 2006, graduating at the top of his
  class before he was hired full time in 2007. He was promoted to fire engineer
  in 2009.

  As an engineer, Prado drives the fire engines, is responsible for the engine’s
  equipment and operates the engine’s pump, a duty that requires quick
  mathematical skills and extensive knowledge of hydraulics during an emergency
  call. Along with these regular duties, Prado plans and oversees the Fire
  Prevention Open House, serves as the department’s IT/system administrator,
  coordinates with local schools to bring in students to help with fire
  department functions and teaches at the MPC Fire Academy. A father of three,
  Prado thought at one point when working in Silicon Valley that his dream of
  becoming a firefighter had slipped away. “I never stopped dreaming or talking
  about it. I was meant to be helping people and working with my hands,” he
  said. “However, a chance meeting with Monterey Division Chief Stewart Roth let
  me know it was not too late to follow my dream.” Since 1982, the Monterey
  County Fire Chiefs Association has presented annual awards to persons who have
  distinguished themselves among their peers and to their organization as
  individuals who have gone above and beyond the call. They have demonstrated
  skills, character, and achievements that deserve special recognition. To honor
  and recognize these individuals, the Monterey County Fire Chiefs Association
  hosts a special awards ceremony in their honor. Awards are presented in three
  categories: Career Firefighter of the Year, Volunteer Firefighter of the Year
  and Support Person of the Year.
