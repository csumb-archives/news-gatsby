<p>CSU Monterey Bay alumna Lisa Fortier was named Rookie Coach of the Year after her first season at the helm at Division I Gonzaga University.</p><p>The award was given out at the annual Women’s Basketball Coaches Association meeting at the NCAA Women’s Final Four in Tampa.
</p><p>Fortier graduated from CSUMB in 2004 with a degree in Human Communication. Longtime Otter fans may remember her as Lisa Mispley, an All&#45;California Pacific Conference selection in her two seasons at CSUMB. She was an NAIA All&#45;Academic team member in 2003, and was named CSUMB’s Female Scholar&#45;Athlete of the Year in 2004.
</p><p>“These awards are about universities, communities, coaching staffs and mostly about players,” she told the Seattle Times. “The young women on our team . . . the way they compete and work to get better is inspiring.”
</p><p>Fortier, who was promoted after seven years as an assistant on Gonzaga’s staff, led the team to a 26&#45;8 finish and its seventh consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. Her team made it to the Sweet 16, after a pair of upsets as an 11&#45;seed.
</p><p>Since 2007, Gonzaga has amassed a 232&#45;51 record, including a 114&#45;10 mark in conference play.
</p><p>Lisa’s husband, Craig Fortier, played for the Otters before graduating in 2003. After 11 years of coaching men’s basketball – at Whitworth and Eastern Washington universities –he joined his wife’s staff at Gonzaga last year.
</p><p>The couple have three children.
