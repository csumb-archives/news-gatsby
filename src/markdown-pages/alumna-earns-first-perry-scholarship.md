<p>Maritza Bautista’s third-grade teacher influenced her career choice.
</p><p>“Just as she helped me, I want to return the favor to my community,” said the CalState TEACH student and Salinas resident. “I want to be as committed as she was.”
</p><p>Bautista, a 2013 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay, has just gotten some help in her pursuit of a teaching credential, in the form of the John and Dorothy Perry Scholarship. The $2,000 scholarship honors longtime public school teacher and administrator John Perry, who spent the last part of his career with CalState TEACH. Bautista is the first recipient of the award and was chosen among 12 applicants by a committee of faculty members.
</p><p>Dorothy Perry created the scholarship to honor her late husband and to support those who are committed to teaching science throughout the curriculum.
</p><p>That’s exactly what Bautista is doing at Tiburcio Vasquez Elementary School in Salinas where she completed her clinical experience and is now teaching while she continues to take online classes. Her school uses individual iPads for all students and she has implemented technology with learning activities in a way that integrates science with reading and math.
</p><p>“If I introduce science with fun activities, then possibly they will pursue a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) career,” she said.
</p><p>As part of her credential program, Bautista has daily contact with a site mentor at the school and consults with a supervising faculty member at the university program. She will complete the program and earn a multiple subject teaching credential in December.
</p><p>CalState TEACH is an online credential program for people who wish to become teachers but are unable to attend traditional classes because of their busy schedules or because they live in remote areas. The program’s foundation is self-study with online materials, e-texts, videos, web-based class discussions and on-site coaching. The state is served from four regional offices, including one at CSUMB.
