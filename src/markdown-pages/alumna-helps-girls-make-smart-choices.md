<h3>Nonprofit Girls Inc. empowers teenagers</h3><p>Patty Fernandez directs an organization that inspires girls to be strong, smart and bold.
</p><p>She’s a good role model to those young girls of what empowered women can achieve if they believe in themselves.
</p><p>Fernandez has been involved with the Central Coast affiliate of Girls Inc. almost since it was established in 2001. The organization works with girls between 9 and 18; it has served more than 900 of them through 24 schools in six local cities.
</p><p>A 1999 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay with a degree in liberal studies, Fernandez started out as a volunteer mentor and eventually became the organization’s executive director.
</p><p>“I am so grateful the founders of Girls Inc. saw the need for girls to take a look at their options in life – to understand they have options – and created a program dedicated to young women so they could learn what to envision, to ask for, to hope for, to achieve,” she said.
</p><p>While most of the programs are held after school hours, a weeklong session is offered during the summer, called “Smart Choices.” More than 40 girls who are about to enter high school will head to CSUMB June 14-18. They’ll explore the university and learn about the requirements for attending college. They’ll also attend workshops that focus on healthy relationships, peer pressure, self-image, self-esteem and healthy eating habits.
</p><p>“Smart Choices enables girls from King City to Castroville to spend a week living on campus and experience college life. The goal is to expose them now, so they will be inspired to prepare themselves to go to college. We tell them: these are your choices, these are the classes you need to take, the decisions you need to make in life,” Fernandez told the Monterey Herald.
</p><p>“They get a taste of what they can have; it’s not out of reach. They can see it and touch it.” That’s significant because 95 percent of them will be the first in their families to go to college.
