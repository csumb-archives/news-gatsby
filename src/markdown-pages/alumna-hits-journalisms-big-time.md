<p>Christy Khoshaba has hit the big time – journalistically speaking.
</p><p>The 2011 Human Communication major has gone from CSU Monterey Bay’s student newspaper, the <em>Otter Realm</em>, to <em>The New York Times</em> – and done so in just over a year. As part of her master’s program at UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism, she enrolled in Digital TV and The World, a hands-on course where students learn the basics of video production.
</p><p>“We learn about a diaspora community in the Bay Area as we learn video skills,” she said. “Then we visit the country of that community for a month.
</p><p>“This year, it was the Chinese community in the Bay Area, and China in the summer.”
</p><p>During the spring semester, Khoshaba produced six short videos on Chinese-Americans. In late May, she and three classmates traveled to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province. There, each student produced one video.
</p><p>“Mine is called ‘The Exam.’ Before I left, my professor worked out an agreement with <em>The New York Times</em> video department” to use the work, she said.
</p><p>“The Exam” tells the story of the high-stakes entrance test all Chinese students must take in order to attend college. Nine million students took the most recent exam; their college acceptance is based entirely on the results.
</p><p>Once the video was completed, the <em>Times’</em> Beijing correspondent, Edward Wong, wrote an accompanying story for the print and web editions of the paper.
</p><p>“I gave him my notes and information about the people in my video and he used some of my reporting in his story. That’s how I became a ‘contributing reporter’,” she said.
</p><p>Khoshaba’s video was displayed prominently on the <em>Times</em> website on June 30 and July 1. The accompanying article appeared in the print edition on July 1.
</p><p>She returned to the U.S. in late June and is spending the rest of the summer in Los Angeles, interning in the fashion and entertainment section of <em>Newsweek/The Daily Beast.</em>
</p><p>She’ll return to Berkeley in August to complete her master’s degree. Then . . . who knows.
</p><p>“My career goal is to be a respected journalist who informs and educates.” And that could take her in many directions.
</p><p>She wants to be an international reporter in the Middle East, perhaps writing for <em>The Economist</em>, <em>Time</em> or <em>The New York Times</em>. “I speak Arabic, so I think that will help tremendously,” she said.
</p><p>“I’m also interested in fashion, so it would be great to write for magazines like *Marie Claire, Harper’s**Bazaar* or *Vogue*. And, I’m interested in hosting an entertainment program like Showbiz Tonight or E News.”
</p><p>She credits her degree from CSUMB for giving her a solid foundation for the work she’s doing now. “My HCom major integrated topics such as journalism, gender studies, media studies, law, literature, philosophy and creative writing. I enjoyed my classes and the professors who taught them.
</p><p>“HCom will always have a place in my heart.”
