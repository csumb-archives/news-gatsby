<p>Miriam Lopez, a seventh-grade teacher at Vista Verde Middle School in Greenfield, has been honored for her work in the classroom. Lopez, who earned a teaching credential from CSU Monterey Bay and is currently enrolled in the university’s master of arts in education program, was given the Crystal Apple Award by television station KSBW. Nine times each year, the station honors teachers from the tri-county area for their “dedication to stimulating minds and improving students' lives.” News anchor Dan Green visits the classrooms of the winners to make the presentation in person. “She has just two years (of teaching) under her belt, but she has been able to learn and apply the best techniques from the great teachers around her,” Green told the viewers. “The kids have really responded.” <a href="http://www.ksbw.com/news/central-california/salinas/Greenfield-teacher-honored-with-Crystal-Apple-Award/25026738">Watch the segment here.</a>
