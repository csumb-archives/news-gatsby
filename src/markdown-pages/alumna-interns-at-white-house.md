<p>CSU Monterey Bay alumna Zoe Carter knew an internship in the nation's capital was a long shot, but she applied anyway.
</p><p>Her first reaction to learning that she had been accepted was, “Take that, you Ivy League kids. This CSU kid is at the White House,” she told the Santa Ynez Valley Journal.
</p><p>Her four-month unpaid stint at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was better than anything she could have expected.
</p><p>“Having the opportunity and privilege to work in the East Wing and meet and work with the people I did is something I will never forget,” she said. She worked in the office of First Lady Michelle Obama from late August through mid-December, on Mrs. Obama’s “Let’s Move” initiative to combat childhood obesity and her project that supports military families, "Joining Forces." And while she did not work directly with the First Lady, she did cross paths with President Obama on her first day at the White House. She met him while walking through the West Wing with a few other interns and a staff member. Carter, 24, graduated from CSUMB in 2010 with an Integrated Studies degree that combined journalism and global studies. While an Otter, she served as Associated Students president and as chair of the California State Student Association. She also studied in Spain and did an internship in London.
</p><p>When her stint at the White House was over, she returned home to Los Olivos, where she gave talks to middle school students about her experience. She also passed on her tips for success: "Build relationships, keep in contact with potential mentors, don't be afraid to ask for help, dream big and try everything."
</p><p>She has relocated to New York City, where she is hoping to land a job in government or public affairs. Her time at the White House is a valuable addition to her resume, and, she hopes, will help her achieve her career goals. “The hard work will pay off eventually,” she said.
