<h3>Jefferson Award winner helps preschoolers thrive</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay alumna Angela Louie Howard “models cultural awareness, humility and responsiveness by working across cultural, linguistic, ethnic and economic lines.”
</p><p>That’s according to an Oakland nonprofit organization, Civic Pride, when it gave her its Civic Award for Distinguished Community Service. It was one of two awards Louie Howard received in 2011. The other was from PG&amp;E.
</p><p>In April of 2013, she received yet another honor when she was named a Jefferson Award winner by San Francisco-area media outlets KPIX television and KCBA radio. 
</p><p>All recognized her work as founder and executive director of Lotus Bloom Child &amp; Family Resource Center in Oakland. Lotus Bloom provides critical early education and support programs for multicultural, low-income families with children under 5 years old.
</p><p>Her programs use art, culture, music, literacy and wellness to help children learn.
</p><p>"I have always loved children and working in early childhood and family support services really showed me how one can impact the entire family and thereby reach a community," Louie Howard said.
</p><p>In 1999, she earned a degree in Liberal Studies with an emphasis in Human Communication. She worked in the Service Learning Institute for three years, as a student assistant and as a University Service Advocate – the forerunner of the Service Learning Student Leadership program.
</p><p>"My experience at CSUMB helped shape my values and bring to light the many injustices that occur in this world," she said. "It also empowered me to organize and create change and contribute to my community."
</p><p>She went on to earn a master’s degree in public administration from Baruch College of the City University of New York in 2002.
</p><p>Her background in education, community and political organizing all came together in founding Lotus Bloom, helped by her respect for and understanding of families and children from culturally and linguistically diverse experiences.
</p><p>“I have always had a vision of people living together in harmony and trust across cultures and languages,” she said on Facebook.
</p><p>At Lotus Bloom, Monday's playgroup takes place in Vietnamese and English, Tuesday's in Chinese and English and Wednesday's in Spanish and English, she told the San Francisco Chronicle. "When we're able to connect to people in their own language and culture, they feel more connected to this place," said Louie Howard, who opened the center in 2008 to help parents improve their children's readiness for elementary school. "You can't talk to people about deeper issues if you're not making them feel welcome and comfortable," she told the newspaper.
</p><p>Lotus Bloom has blossomed into five Oakland centers serving more than 300 children. Funded largely by grants, it offers most parents free or low-cost tutiion. She said she’s proud that Lotus Bloom – “we chose the name because, like the lotus flower, we have a vision of growing and blossoming in tough and rough places” – has achieved recognition as an oasis for families. “We love the fact that families come back to us daily and access our services.” What advice would she give aspiring change makers?
</p><p>“Do what is in your heart. Take concrete steps to follow your dreams and, before you know it, an army is behind you.”
