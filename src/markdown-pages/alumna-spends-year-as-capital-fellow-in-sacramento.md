<p>Diana Vasquez grew up in the San Fernando Valley town of Pacoima with an appetite for politics.
</p><p>As a teenager, she worked on political campaigns and community outreach efforts on issues such as immigration reform and youth development. Through high school and college at UC Davis – where she earned a B.A. in political science and Chicano/a Studies in 2007 – she worked to help disadvantaged youth and dislocated workers.
</p><p>The 2011 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay’s Master of Public Policy program remains passionate about helping people. She’s especially concerned about access to higher education.
</p><p>“I became interested in working in government because I was witnessing many injustices directly impacting working class communities,” Vasquez said. “I needed to be exposed to the everyday functions of government to learn how to create change in our society.”
</p><p>That led her to the Capital Fellows Program in Sacramento. She was chosen for the prestigious Jesse Unruh Fellowship Program, one of only 18 people selected from a statewide pool of applicants. The program is named for former Assembly speaker and state treasurer Jesse M. Unruh. The program is ranked among the top 10 internships in the nation for its combination of meaningful work experience and career opportunities.
</p><p>The Fellows spend 11 months in Sacramento. Following a six&#45;week orientation, they began their office placements Dec. 5.
</p><p>Vasquez was assigned to the office of Assemblymember Mike Eng, where she is focusing on issues related to education. In that role, she follows all legislation that comes before the Assembly education committee and makes recommendations to Mr. Eng.
</p><p>In addition to her staff work, she also attends a graduate seminar weekly. The academic component of the fellowship emphasizes the legislative process and provides opportunities to meet with lobbyists, legislators and committee staff members to discuss issues such as campaign finance, term limits and the initiative process.
</p><p>“I appreciate the fact that I am able to learn the three Ps of government: the politics, the policy and the process,” she said. “That will help me understand how to navigate the legislative process as well as the politics of the state capital.”
</p><p>After her fellowship ends next fall, she hopes to continue working for the legislature and drafting legislation. But, she’s quick to add, her commitment to making education accessible to everyone will stay with her, whether she’s working inside or outside of government.
</p><p>She credits her graduate degree from CSUMB with helping her on her way to accomplishing her goals. “It allowed me to examine the various issues related to policy. Stakeholders must be considered, budget, alternatives, impacts, etc., that may not be readily identifiable to others.
</p><p>“I am thankful for all the support I was given at CSUMB.”
