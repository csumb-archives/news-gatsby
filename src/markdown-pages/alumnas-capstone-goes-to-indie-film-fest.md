<p>Many young filmmakers submit their work dozens of times before being accepted into a festival. That wasn’t the case with 2013 graduate Margo Flitcraft, who struck gold right out of the box.
</p><p>Using Withoutabox, a website which offers filmmakers a platform to submit their work to more than 900 festivals (including Sundance), Flitcraft sent her capstone to five events. She was accepted into the first one – Timecode: NOLA Film Fest 2 in New Orleans. The festival, scheduled for Sept. 18-22, will include independent films from local and international filmmakers, as well as industry panels, workshops and even a skateboard filmmaking symposium. Flitcraft’s film, “Please, Tell Someone Dear,” tells a heartbreaking story of sexual assault in the military and coping with PTSD. It screened at last spring’s Capstone Festival; was shown along with Kirby Dick’s “The Invisible War” at CSUMB’s World Theater; and at the Carmel Short Cinema event.
</p><p>“Your film encapsulates the heart of independent filmmaking by pushing boundaries of creativity and drive without the support of a large crew or big budget,” her acceptance letter said.
</p><p>Professor Luis Camara was Flitcraft’s Capstone adviser.
