<p>Andrea Aguilar always knew that she wanted to work in the film and TV industry, but CSUMB helped her realize how powerful a tool the media really is.
</p><p>“TV reaches all the corners of the earth. I remember as a child how much information I absorbed because of it,” said Aguilar, a 2007 TAT graduate. “We look to the media for everything. I hope to someday be a big part of that influence.”
</p><p>She’s on the way to accomplishing just that. She’s currently an associate producer for The Rachel Zoe Project on the Bravo cable TV channel. Her other credits include BBQ Pitmasters, LA Ink, Gene Simmons Family Jewels and Big Brother.
</p><p>She’s most proud of her work on The Swell Life featuring champion surfer Izzy Paskowitz and his family. They run Surfers Healing, a nonprofit organization that offers free surf day camps to autistic children. The program will air on Oprah Winfrey’s new cable network OWN.
</p><p>“My work has given me the opportunity to experience different slices of humanity, from surfing cowboys to high-profile fashionistas. It’s awesome to put on different hats and assume someone else’s lifestyle for three to six months,” Aguilar said.
</p><p>“Challenging? Yes. Boring? Far from it.”
</p><p>From her home on Venice Beach – which she shares with her dog, Yoshi – she runs a group on Facebook called TAT Creative Connection. “It’s an alumni group that helps alums and people who have worked with us to stay connected. We post jobs, rooms for rent, projects and discussions,” she said.
