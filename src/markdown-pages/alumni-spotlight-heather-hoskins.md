<p>Heather Hoskins (HCom ’05) turned her experiences as a student journalist into a career.
</p><p>While her major didn’t include a concentration in public relations – the subject that most interested her – the professor in charge of journalism and media studies allowed her to plan the events surrounding the grand opening of the Otter Realm newsroom. She was also a staff writer and arts and entertainment editor of the student paper, and worked as a public relations intern for Youth Music Monterey.
</p><p>“Among all these experiences, I got a good grasp of the industry I hoped to break into,” she said.
</p><p>After graduating, she moved to Las Vegas to work as a product manager for an advertising company. She worked with corporate clients including Microsoft and MTV, and trained company employees in two offices in China.
</p><p>Now a resident of Olympia, Wash., she works as director of search engine optimization and communications for Kitson Boards, a designer and manufacturer of paddle boards, wakeboards and surfboards, and for WineRackStore.com, an online seller of wine rack and wine cellars.
</p><p>She oversees media relations for both companies. “Because of my news reporting experiences at CSUMB, I have been able to form good relationships with local and national media, which greatly benefits the businesses I work for.
</p><p>“And the writing techniques I picked up as a student journalist helped give me an SEO advantage, as I battle it out with Google every month for top keyword rankings,” she said.
</p><p>Because the Monterey area still holds a special place in her heart, and she returns once or twice a year. And she has fond memories of her time at the university.
</p><p>“I sport my alumni license plate holder with pride, and I actually have an otter key chain from freshman orientation still attached to my car keys.
</p><p>“I loved everything about my time at CSU Monterey Bay, and I definitely recommend it to others.” Learn more about CSUMB's Alumni Association <a href="http://csumb.edu/alumni/">here</a>. Learn more about Human Communication <a href="http://hcom.csumb.edu/">here</a>.
