<p>Steven Goings (SBS ’10) will be honored at the annual Crystal Ball, an event that benefits the education and prevention programs of Central Coast HIV/AIDS Services (CCHAS).
</p><p>Goings, one of two honorees at the Feb. 22 event, will be honored for his work promoting AIDS awareness and prevention at CSU Monterey Bay during the three years – 2010-'12 – he served as the university’s purposeful service coordinator.
</p><p>Goings first came out in public as a person living with AIDS when he suggested that the university reach out to long-term AIDS survivors at an Early Outreach Program event in 2010. A few weeks later, Goings’ journey into higher education as a re-entry student and person with AIDS was featured in a promotional video for EOP.
</p><p>Shortly after joining CSUMB’s Service Learning Institute in August 2010, he partnered with CCHAS to host a candlelight vigil at the campus Student Center in honor of World AIDS Day. The program expanded in 2011 to include guest speakers from Community Hospital, CCHAS, CSUMB Health and Wellness Services and State Assemblyman (now Senator) Bill Monning.
</p><p>In 2012, Goings’ last year in the position, AIDS Day turned into a full week with programming that included volunteer opportunities, movies, open mic, personal testimonials of people impacted by the disease and workshops that explored complex social justice dimensions of the disease.
</p><p>Goings serves on the board of directors of African American HIV/AIDS Wellness, which partners each year with CSUMB’s Black Students United in support of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.
