<p>Did you know there are Emmy awards for sports broadcasting? 
</p><p>Several dozen of them were handed out in New York on May 7 at the annual Sports Emmy Awards event.
</p><p>One of them went to Casey Richards (TAT ’02). Richards, a resident of Atlanta, received an Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in the category of outstanding playoff coverage.
</p><p>He was part of a team at TNT that won for its work on the National Basketball Association post-season telecasts in 2012.
</p><p>“I was a writer/producer on the team. We all worked on this – the award was for the comprehensive playoff package. That means promotional spots, lead-ins, game elements . . . creative services that required a quick turnaround,” he said.
</p><p>For this year’s basketball playoffs, currently under way, he’s doing the games’ opening pieces – “a kind of music video to hype people up for the game,” he said.
</p><p>He’s also working on promos for the Sunday baseball broadcasts on TBS and creating pieces for the upcoming NASCAR season.
</p><p>While he’s won other awards, and was nominated for an Emmy last year for his work on a baseball video featuring Bruce Springsteen, this is his first Emmy win.
</p><p>Richards’ career has taken him across the country several times. After graduating in 2002, he worked for an advertising agency in Los Angeles, part of the in-house video editorial team. That was followed by a move to Atlanta, where he worked as an associate writer/producer for on-air promotions at Turner Broadcasting.
</p><p>A couple of years later, he moved to Fox Sports, but stayed in Atlanta. In 2008, an opportunity presented itself at E! Entertainment in Los Angeles, where he worked as a writer/producer of on-air promotions. Then another cross-country move – back to Turner where he works in the Creative Services Sports Unit, the network’s in-house advertising operation for all the company’s sports properties, including professional basketball, baseball, NASCAR, golf and college basketball.
</p><p>“I didn’t target sports out of school,” he said. “I fell into it out of necessity when the network I was working for was taken over by Fox Sports. It’s the same way I got into reality television when accepting a job at E! Regardless of the content, I’ve always adapted and all my jobs have been on the creative side of the industry.”
</p><p>But sports is not unfamiliar territory for him.
</p><p>“I’m a fan. You have to be to do this kind of work. I get free tickets to games – a nice perk. But I don’t watch ESPN 24 hours a day, and I can’t rattle off statistics.”
