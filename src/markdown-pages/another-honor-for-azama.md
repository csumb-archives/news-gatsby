  Yo Azama (MAE 2015) has earned another award for his work in the classroom and
  in promoting language study.
</p>
<p>
  Azama, who earned a single&#45;subject credential at Cal State Monterey Bay as
  well as an M.A. in education, has received the Elgin Heinz Teacher Award from
  the United States&#45;Japan Foundation. The award recognizes exceptional
  teachers who further mutual understanding between Americans and Japanese. It
  was presented during a ceremony at Stanford University.
</p>
<p>
  It is named for Elgin Heinz, a pioneer in educating American students about
  Asia. It includes a $2,500 cash award and $5,000 in project funds. Azama has
  taught Japanese at North Salinas High School for many years. He believes
  “language connects us and as a result it binds us into the global family that
  we are.” In addition to teaching, he’s a team leader of the Monterey Bay World
  Language Project and serves as a College Board adviser for the Advanced
  Placement Japanese Language and Culture Development Committee.
</p>
<p>
  He also teaches a modern language method course in CSUMB’s teacher education
  program.
</p>
<p>
  The Elgin Heinz award is just one of his many honors. In 2012, the Council on
  the Teaching of Foreign Language named him National Language Teacher of the
  Year.
