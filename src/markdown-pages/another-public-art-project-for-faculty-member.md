<p><a href="//vpa.csumb.edu/people/johanna-poethig">Johanna Poethig</a>, who has worked on dozens of large-scale murals and other art installations around the country, has taken on yet another project.
</p><p>Poethig, a professor in CSU Monterey Bay’s <a href="http://vpa.csumb.edu">Visual and Public Art Department,</a> has been named lead artist on a transportation project in the East Bay area of San Francisco.
</p><p>She and <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2012/oct/11/art-social-change">Mildred Howard</a>, another artist from the Berkeley-Oakland area, will work to integrate art into the architecture of 34 planned stations on the 9.5-mile East Bay Bus Rapid Transit route that will run from Oakland to the San Leandro BART station. Also on the team are artists Joyce Hsu and Peter Richards.
</p><p>A panel of art professionals, government and community representatives chose the artists after a national search. The team will integrate works into the stations around a central theme of “Honor the Past and Celebrate the Future.”
</p><p>Poethig’s Bay Area work includes a mural in downtown San Francisco for the International Hotel in Manilatown, a ceramic tile installation at the 149 Mason Street Studios, and medallions for the Hamilton Recreation Center.
</p><p>Born in New Jersey and raised in Manila, Philippines, Poethig earned degrees from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Mills College. She’s been in California since 1976, forging an eclectic career from a variety of interests and mediums, from painting and sculpture to performance art and video. <em>Photo courtesy of AC Transit  (Left to right): Peter Richards, Johanna Poethig, Mildred Howard, Joyce Hsu</em>
