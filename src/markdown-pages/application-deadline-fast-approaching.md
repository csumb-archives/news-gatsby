</p><p>A Nov. 30 application deadline for students seeking admission to California State University, Monterey Bay for the fall 2010 semester is fast approaching.
</p><p>Since the application period opened Oct. 1, CSU Monterey Bay has received about 8,000 applications for next fall. Up to another 1,000 are expected by next Monday's deadline, said Ronnie Higgs, associate vice president for enrollment services.
</p><p>"This is the last week that we'll be receiving applications, and those who have not applied need to get their applications in now," Higgs said.
</p><p>Any applicant who receives a question about some aspect of his or her application should reply as quickly as possible to avoid disqualification, he said.
</p><p>The university plans to send out notifications of admission in mid-December.
</p><p>No applications are being accepted for the spring 2010 semester because of state budget cuts, and a lack of funding is also limiting how many students CSU Monterey Bay can accept for next fall.
</p><p>High school seniors can visit <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu" title="www.csumentor.edu">www.csumentor.edu</a> to submit applications. More information is available by calling the CSUMB Office of Admissions at 831-582-3738.
