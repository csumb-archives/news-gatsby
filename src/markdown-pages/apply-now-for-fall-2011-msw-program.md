<p>CSU Monterey Bayâ€™s Master of Social Work program is accepting applications for Fall 2011. Application deadline is Jan. 31
</p><p>The program provides an opportunity for people who are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is both accessible and affordable. It is intended to address a chronic shortage of professionally trained social workers in the tri-county area, especially those who are bilingual and bicultural.
</p><p>Classes are small and personal, and are offered in the evenings. The three-year program allows students to concentrate in either Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year.
</p><p>For more information, contact Vivienne Orgel at 582-5315. Admission requirements and application materials are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/msw">here</a>.
</p><p>An information session to learn more about the program is scheduled for Jan. 20, noon to 1 p.m. in Beach Hall. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>Last fall's inaugural class numbered 41 students. Ninety-five percent of them come from Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties; 10 percent are employed by one of those counties; most are female; and 40 percent are bilingual.  Nearly 70 percent earned a bachelor's degree in the last five years and nearly 60 percent are under the age of 30.
