<h2>Next steps</h2><h3>Shoes start a journey of understanding</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay students went barefoot on April 5 to raise awareness of the impact a pair of shoes can have on a child’s life.
</p><p>The effort was part of the international One Day Without Shoes campaign that was originated by TOMS Shoes, a company that donates a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair purchased.
</p><p>CSUMB students kicked off their shoes for a walk around the main quad, through the Dining Commons and the library.
</p><p>“About 15 students marched in our group,” said Alexandra Simard, a student from Orange County. “We had a megaphone, and we used it to ask people to take off their shoes. A lot of them did,” she said. The students who complied with the request “asked us what was going on. It gave us a chance to talk about the issue.”
</p><p>TOMS gives away its shoes to children in 23 countries, including the United States, but primarily in developing countries where children have to walk barefoot to school, to reach clean water or for medical help.
</p><p>“Children who don’t have shoes get diseases,” said Hailey Hohl of Patterson. “Today’s event raises awareness about that.”
</p><p>Added Simard: “Children in developing countries can’t get to school, can't get an education, because they don’t have shoes. Since I’m a college student, I think about that.”
</p><p>Company founder Blake Mycoskie told the Los Angeles Times he expected a 1 million people to participate worldwide.
</p><p>According to the One Day Without Shoes website, shoes are a luxury for hundreds of millions of children, a luxury their families can’t afford.
</p><p>In many developing countries, children walk barefoot for miles risking injury, infection and exposure to soil-transmitted diseases. Many schools require shoes for attendance, giving children without them no opportunity to learn. And some soil-based diseases not only cause physical symptoms, but create cognitive impairment, too, crippling a child's long-term potential.
</p><p>TOMS has sponsored the event for five years, but Mycoskie is nowhere close to his goal of stamping out foot diseases worldwide.
</p><p>He told the Huffington Post:
</p><p>"I think sometimes we forget what we have, and occasionally it's important to remind ourselves. Most people don't even realize how many children in developing countries grow up barefoot and all the risks, infections and diseases they endure. For most of us, modern shoes are so comfortable and accessible, we forget about our feet, but they are a source of constant focus for others.
</p><p>"I wanted everyone to personally understand the impact of shoes," he said, "and the difference they can make, so we thought, 'Why don't we get a taste of what these kids go through every day?' "
