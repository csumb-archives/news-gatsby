<p>
  Dr. Ruben Mendoza, professor of archaeology at Cal State Monterey Bay, has
  been invited to Rome to participate in two events focusing on Junipero Serra.
</p>
<p>
  On April 30, he will join three other scholars at a news conference, where
  they will provide an overview of Father Serra’s life and legacy. Media members
  from all over the world are expected to attend.
</p>
<p>
  On May 2 at a seminary in Vatican City, he will participate in a symposium
  examining the canonization of Father Serra. Pope Francis is expected to
  attend.
</p>
<p>
  “My participation is a result of my, and my students, 20 or so years of
  archaeological and historical fieldwork in the California missions,” Dr.
  Mendoza said.
</p>
<p>
  “Given that only four Serra scholars from North America have been invited to
  present with a host of theologians and other scholars from the Vatican and
  Europe, I am truly honored to serve in such a capacity.”
</p>
<p>
  Dr. Mendoza is one of the researchers whose work has prompted a reappraisal of
  Serra, whom Pope Francis is expected to elevate to sainthood in September.

  Father Serra, founder of nine of the California missions, imposed a slave
  system that destroyed the Indians’ way of life.
</p>
<p>
  “Dig a little deeper,” he told the Times, “and you’ll find evidence of a new
  diverse society flourishing, one that makes California and its Latino culture
  unique.”
