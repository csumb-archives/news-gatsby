  SEASIDE, Ca., March 1, 2019 – The American Institute of Architects, California
  (AIACA) announced the winners of the eighth annual
  <a href="https://www.architectureatzero.com/">Architecture at Zero</a>
  competition for zero net energy (ZNE) today at CSUMB's Alumni and Visitor
  Center. The competition was open for entries from students and professionals
  worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  This year, AIACA partnered with California State University, Monterey Bay
  (CSUMB) to create a ZNE Student Recreation Center at the campus. ZNE
  structures are designed from the start to be energy efficient and offset the
  energy they consume through onsite renewable energy generation such as rooftop
  solar. Winners were chosen by a panel of international experts and awarded up
  to $25,000 in total prizes.

<h4>College Student “Citation” winners included:</h4>

  The competition strives to generate new, innovative ideas for ZNE construction
  to help achieve California’s goal for all new residential construction to be
  ZNE by 2020 and all new commercial construction to be ZNE by 2030.
</p>
<p>
  “CSUMB students, faculty and staff practice transparent planning and
  environmental stewardship daily as we transform a former army base into an
  inspiring university campus. The campus is thrilled to partner with AIA CA and
  participants from around the world to develop zero net energy building designs
  for a Student Recreation Center that reduces our exercise of natural
  resources,” said Matthew S. McCluney, Senior Campus Planner at CSUMB.

  Torcellini, Principal Engineer, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Gregg
