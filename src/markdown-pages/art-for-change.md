<p>Art can be a powerful tool for change, disseminating ideas and inspiring people to act.
</p><p>Sea Change, an exhibit at the Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, is doing just that — with the aim of bringing together art and concern for climate change.
</p><p>Enid Baxter Blader, chair of the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay, served as guest curator for the exhibit. It includes a diverse collection of contemporary projects by artists, architects and scientists who explore the shifting interactions of land and sea – specifically, the rising sea level in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.
</p><p>She was invited to curate the show by “a wonderful and respected group, WEAD (Women’s Environmental Art Directory,” Blader said.
</p><p>Lauren Elder, a WEAD board member, “was a true partner in creating this exhibition which we have been working on for a year.”
</p><p>Blader has worked on a number of science and art participatory exhibitions. In the last two years, she has curated or co-curated exhibitions at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento; the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena; and the prestigious Bay-Delta Science Conference in 2012, where she organized the conference’s first-ever arts exhibit, gave a plenary talk on science and art to 1,800 scientists and chaired a related panel.
</p><p>Since her childhood growing up in a mining town – where she watched a mountain get razed – she has been interested in the intersections of landscape, history and community.
</p><p>“All of my work resonates with these themes – <a href="http://fortording.com/">plantord</a>, <a href="http://www.watercalifornia.org/">waterca</a>, <a href="http://www.local909er.com/">local909ers</a>. So do the workshops I founded through the <a href="http://www.montereybayfilmsociety.org/">Monterey Bay Film Society</a>,” she said. “People, ecology and history.”
</p><p>She makes work about “where I live or where I’m invited to investigate. I love people, histories and landscapes.
</p><p>“I have a mind for science as an artist, and many scientists have a mind for art. There is a deep kinship there.”
</p><p>Details: The Sea Change exhibit will be on display June 8-Sept. 15 at Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, 4901 Breakwater Ave., Hayward, (510) 670-7270.
