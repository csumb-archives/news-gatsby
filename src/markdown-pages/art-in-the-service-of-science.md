Graduates are working at the Smithsonian Institution; New York’s American Museum of Natural History; the LosAngeles Museum of Natural History; the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and National Geographic, Scientific American and Nature magazines.

<em>The exhibit is made possible by a grant to the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History from the Arts Council for Monterey County.</em>
