<h3>Mildred Howard visits CSUMB Oct. 25</h3><p>Berkeley artist Mildred Howard is an epic part of the East Bay’s cultural landscape, according to the San Francisco Examiner. She has an impressive list of important projects including installations in the De Young Museum, the San Francsico Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Wash., the San Jose Museum of Art, and galleries in Boston and Los Angeles as well as international exhibitions in Paris, Berlin, Cairo, and the United Kingdom.  As an artist, she says her cause is to fight to give a voice to people, things and themes that are overlooked in society. She joins objects of the past with present meaning, creating antique&#45;looking sculptures in reference to global socio&#45;political relationships, and riddled with metaphors of past, present and future.
</p><p>The local community will have the opportunity to learn about Howard’s work when she visits CSU Monterey Bay on Oct. 25. Her free talk, part of the Visiting Artists Series, will start at 6 p.m. in the University Center living room. The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Driving directions and a campus map can be found <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>Howard has founded educational programs, managed an art and communities program at San Francisco’s Exploratorium, and was executive director of Alice Waters’ Edible Schoolyard Project. She’s taught at just about every university and art institution in the San Francisco Bay Area and has also worked at Alameda County Juvenile Hall and Bay Area jails.
</p><p>Her visit is the second in this semester’s series of visiting artists. The last artist to visit this semester will be muralist John Wehrle, who is scheduled to speak on Nov. 8.
