<p>In order to graduate, CSU Monterey Bay students in the Visual and Public Art Department create a capstone project – a sort of senior thesis of art. Mounted together, they form an exhibit open to the public. The capstone projects are the final capping of skills, knowledge, values and commitments of the individual students. In these projects, student artists have identified public themes and critical issues that are relevant to themselves and their audience. This year’s exhibit gathers 35 works in a show of creative force. The exhibit will open on Monday, May 16, with an artists’ reception at 6 p.m. in the Visual and Public Art Building (Bldg. 71). The public is invited. The art department is housed in buildings located at the intersection of Inter-Garrison Road and Fifth Avenue. An exhibit catalog can be found <a href="http://vpa2.csumb.edu/capstone/capstone2011/">here</a>. The work will be on display until the final capstone and medal ceremony, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Friday, May 20. The public is invited to this free event or to view the exhibit during normal business hours. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here.</a> The campuswide Capstone Festival will take place Thursday and Friday, May 19 and 20.
