<h5>Exhibits curated by museum studies students</h5><p>Work by faculty and staff in the Department of Visual and Public Art is featured in the newly opened Balfour Brutzman Art Gallery, located in Building 71.
</p><p>The inaugural exhibition, "View of VPA," was curated by Cristiano Colantoni and Paul Van de Carr, students in the university's museum studies program.
</p><p>The program focuses on the museum's potential and ethical responsibility for representing history and culture in a way that shapes the public's concept of its values. Students divide their time between the university setting and internships in local museums where students learn basic operation skills, conservation application, exhibit content, design and interpretation.
