</p><p>. . . We are leading the transformation of Fort Ord. The economy has delayed several projects on the former Army base, but the university keeps moving ahead – in enrollment, employment, facilities and housing. With a payroll of nearly 900, CSUMB is one of the county's 20 largest employers and a key player in its vital economic sector of higher education. – <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>, Jan. 8, 2012
