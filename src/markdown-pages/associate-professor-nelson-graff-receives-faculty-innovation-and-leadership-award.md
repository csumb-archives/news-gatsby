<p>
  SEASIDE, Calif., August 26, 2019 – California State University, Monterey Bay
  (CSUMB) Communications Across the Disciplines associate professor Nelson Graff
  was one of 19 faculty across the California State University (CSU) system to
  be awarded the<a

  >
    Faculty Innovation and Leadership Award</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The award honors faculty who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership to
  advance student success at the CSU. Graff is recognized for implementing the
  Reading Apprenticeship (RA) framework in courses across disciplines at CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  Since his first year on campus in 2015, Graff has centered reading practice as
  a foundation of education at CSUMB. As a response to assessments identifying
  reading as the most significant hurdle encountered by students, Graff brought
  the RA program to multiple disciplines on campus, including First-Year Seminar
  and freshman mathematics and statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Graff transformed reading and written communication instruction when he
  created CSUMB's two semester “stretch" course, incorporating RA routines and
  strategies. Following the CSU's elimination of non-credit bearing remedial
  writing courses, Graff's stretch model proved to be successful, with all
  students of various levels of academic preparation passing the course at the
  same rate.
</p>
<p>
  Graff's efforts have already shown a positive impact on student success: In
  fall 2018, pass rates for students enrolled in the co-requisite,
  credit-bearing support courses were 2 to 6% higher than students who had been
  enrolled in the remedial course during the prior semester, suggesting that the
  credit-bearing, co-requisite support course was more effective than the
  non-credit ​bearing remedial course that was eliminated by EO 1110.​
</p>
<p>
  Awardees receive $5,000, as well as $10,000 allocated to their academic
  department in support of ongoing innovation and leadership to advance student
  success at the CSU. Funding for the awards is provided by generous grant
  support from the College Futures Foundation, who sees faculty innovation and
  leadership as vital to improving outcomes for California's diverse students.
</p>
<p>
  “These outstanding faculty consistently engage students with innovative
  practices and foster stimulating and equitable learning environments that
  support these students on their path to graduation," said CSU Chancellor
  Timothy P. White. “Their commitment to deepen and enrich learning by putting
  students at the center of all they do is fundamental to the mission of the
  CSU, and is helping to transform higher education nationwide."
</p>
<p>
  Faculty innovation is crucial to reaching the ambitious student success goals
  outlined in the CSU's
