<p><b>TO: CSUMB Students and Campus Community </b></p>
<p><b>FROM: Associated Students (2020-2021)</b></p>
<p>
  As students, we recognize that many are deeply affected in significant ways by
  the painful, unjust systems that exist in our country today. While America may
  see itself as “the land of the free and home of the brave”, in truth, this is
  not our present reality; we are far from it. It is a disheartening fact that
  we continue to lose innocent lives at the hands of those sworn to serve and
  protect us with little change.
</p>
<p>
  The murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless
  others are reminders that racism and police brutality continue to plague our
  country. The Black community is not safe to go on a simple jog in their
  neighborhood or to reside in their own homes. Racism is embedded in society
  and is so much more than men in white hoods.
</p>
<p>
  The constant disregard for the lives of people of color, more specifically our
  Black community, has led to powerful movements of protests and unfortunate
  chaos. However, with media biases and propaganda, it is easy for our judgments
  to be clouded or our integrity to be compromised because such fear and anxiety
  escalates as we see this through every media platform 24/7.
</p>
<p>
  As students in this era, we have the resources prior generations did not have.
  We must persevere to ensure that as student leaders and scholars at the
  university -- we work towards creating a more fair and equitable society where
  individuals can live freely and those who unjustly mistreat and harm others
  can also be held accountable. While nobody can do everything, everybody can do
  something.
</p>
<p>
  As your student government, we are committed to embracing the core values
  associated with community, advocacy, and inclusivity -- all of which
  reinforces the importance of dismantling systemic racism in all of its forms
  to our roles as student leaders. Our advocacy will go beyond CSUMB and will
  include the 22 other CSU campuses to empower the voices of over 400,000
  students through our collaboration with the Cal State Student Association
  (CSSA).
</p>
<p>
  Associated Students encourages the CSUMB community to stand with us as allies,
  to support and act through on-going education, policy changes, peaceful
  protests, providing donations, signing petitions, sharing information, voting,
  or simply speaking out when we see an unjust incident occurring. Also, please
  remember to practice self-care, to give each other space, to support and above
  all/more importantly to listen to what matters as we engage in civil discourse
  with one another in mindful, courageous and constructive ways as a campus
  community.
</p>
<p>
  As Associated Students, we will dedicate to utilize our platform to address
  these critical challenges, injustices, and inequities affecting us both at
  CSUMB and our surrounding communities.
</p>
<p>
  It is critical for all of us to be able to stand up, voice if not demand
  structural change, human lives depend on it. To our student body, please know
  that we as the Associated Students (AS) and as student leaders, we recognize
  your concerns. We value you. We hear you. We stand with you.
</p>
<p><b>In solidarity,</b></p>
