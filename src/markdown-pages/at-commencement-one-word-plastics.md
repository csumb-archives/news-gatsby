<p>Class of 2016 dons regalia made from recycled bottles</p><p>The gowns worn by CSU Monterey Bay’s graduates will still be black, but they’ll also be green.
</p><p>The graduation regalia is manufactured from Repreve, a fiber made of recycled materials, including plastic bottles. It takes approximately 27 bottles to make a gown.
</p><p>This year, students at 1,250 colleges and universities will wear robes made of Repreve.
</p><p>The plastic bottles are chopped, ground, melted and reformulated into chips that go through a proprietary process that produces yarn. Every pound of yarn that goes into the fabric used in the gowns saves one&#45;half gallon of gasoline and produces half the CO2 emissions of the typical polyester manufacturing process, according to the company.
</p><p>Not only is it smart for the environment, but CSUMB commencement coordinator Phyllis Grillo said the recycled gowns look better than the non&#45;recycled options.
</p><p>"They wrinkle less," Grillo said.
