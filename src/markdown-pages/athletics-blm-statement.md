  In reflection on the horrific murder of George Floyd and the events ignited
  each day since - we fully embrace our role standing in support of our Black
  student-athletes, coaches and staff. We remain deeply committed to advancing
  diversity, equity and inclusion across all aspects of our department and
  campus community.
</p>
<p>
  We stand against systemic racism and social injustice with a strong belief
  that together we need to learn more and use the urgency of the moment to
  develop our ability to understand, advocate, take action and be a part of real
  change.
</p>
<p>
  We are proud of all our student-athletes, alumni, and coaches for using their
  voice to speak up, participate in open dialogue and influence change during
  these challenging times.
</p>
<p>
  We are committed to bringing our Otter Athletics community together to have
  the hard conversations, to listen, engage and build trust through respect and
  empathy.
