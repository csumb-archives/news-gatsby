<h2>Kiyo's Story</h2><p>Unlike many of her fellow internees, Kiyo Sato is willing to discuss her family’s experience during World War II.
</p><p>For years, she has spoken to students, church groups and other gatherings about how a frightened nation looking for scapegoats in the hysteria after Pearl Harbor resulted in 120,000 of its Japanese-American residents – most of them American citizens – being thrown into heavily guarded camps in remote and desolate places such as Poston, Ariz.
</p><p>“I believe in everybody talking about it,” Sato told the Sacramento Bee in 2007. “I don’t think it’s something you forget.”
</p><p>In 2007, she wrote an eloquent memoir, “Dandelion Through the Crack.” In its latest edition, the book is titled “Kiyo’s Story: A Japanese-American Family’s Quest for the American Dream.” It won the 2008 William Saroyan Prize for Nonfiction.
</p><p>Sato will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 14 to talk about her life growing up in California, being swept off to an internment camp as an 18-year-old student at Sacramento Junior College, and ultimately surviving and succeeding despite terrible odds and oppressive prejudice.
</p><p>Her talk will start at 2 p.m. in Room 1188 of the Tanimura and Antle Library. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Sato mulled over the idea of writing a book for four decades, taking the occasional writing class. It wasn’t until 2003 that she decided to do it.
</p><p>She told the Bee that she sees the book as a way to make sure the forced internment of America’s residents never happens again.

</p><p><em>It is a magnificent memoir, fully worthy of being compared to Farewell to Manzanar. I cannot praise its pointillist realism, its Zen-like austerity, highly enough. Exquisite.</em> – Kevin Starr, author of California: A History
