<h3>Tim Wise visits campus Sept. 18</h3><p>Anti-racism activist and educator Tim Wise will discuss white privilege and how it ultimately harms its beneficiaries when he visits CSU Monterey Bay on Sept. 18.
</p><p>His lecture will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue and B Street. Tickets – $10 for the public and free to CSUMB students, faculty and staff with CSUMB username – will be available at the door. Visitors must purchase a parking permit from the machine located on the parking lot. 
</p><p>Wise will examine what it means to be white in a nation created for the benefit of those who are “white like him,” and how privilege seeps into every institutional arrangement, from education to employment to the justice system.
</p><p>Through storytelling and analysis, he makes the case that racial inequity and white privilege are real and persistent threats to personal and collective well-being, but resistance to white supremacy and racism is possible.
</p><p>Wise has been called “one of the most brilliant, articulate and courageous critics of white privilege in the nation.” He has appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs, is a regular contributor to discussions about race on CNN, and has appeared on ABC's 20/20.
</p><p>He is the author of six books including “White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son” and “Colorblind: The Rise of Post-Racial Politics and the Retreat from Racial Equity.”
</p><p>A question-and-answer session and a book signing will follow the talk.
</p><p>The Otter Cross Cultural Center, Otter Student Union, Associated Students and the Service Learning Institute are co-sponsors of the lecture.
