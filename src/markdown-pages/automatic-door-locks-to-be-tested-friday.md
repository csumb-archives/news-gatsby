<p>On Friday, March 25, at 9 a.m., IT and UPD will test the automatic door locking system on campus. All doors controlled by card access will be remotely locked and then unlocked 10 to 15 minutes later. We will work to minimize the disruption as much as possible.
</p><p>During the test, people will be able to exit the buildings, but card keys will not unlock the doors.
</p><p>This test will help us to lock campus buildings in the event of an emergency or other campus closure.
