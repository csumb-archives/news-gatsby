<h5>Pianist Kenny Barron lectures at CSUMB Nov. 3</h5><p>Kenny Barron's unmatched ability to mesmerize audiences with his elegant playing, sensitive melodies and infectious rhythms inspired the Los Angeles Times to name him "one of the top jazz pianists in the world." Jazz Weekly has called him "The most lyrical piano player of our time." Mr. Barron will give a lecture-demonstration at California State University, Monterey Bay from 10 a.m. to noon on Thursday, Nov. 3 in the Music Hall, Bldg. 30, on Sixth Avenue. The "concert" is free and open to the public. Parking will be free in lots 29 and 30. Ray Drummond, CSUMB faculty member and well-known bassist, will sit in on several pieces. Much admired for his capacity to extract lovely tonal sounds from the piano, Mr. Barron also knows how to deliver up-tempo improvisations with grace, elegance and a powerful sense of swing - all of which will be on display at the Nov. 3 lecture-demonstration. For more information, or to request disability accommodations, call Shirlene Campbell at 582-3009.
