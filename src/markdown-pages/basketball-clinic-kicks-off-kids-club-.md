</p><p>CSUMB athletics kicked off a year-round series of "FUN-damental" sports clinics on Nov. 29 when the men's basketball team worked with young athletes at the Otter Sports Center.
</p><p>Under the direction of head coach Rob Bishop, youngsters learned proper shooting and dribbling as well as good teamwork skills.
</p><p>"This was the first of several free clinics we hope to run this year and it was a big success," said head coach Rob Bishop. "We had close to 50 kids. It was a great opportunity for my program to give back to the community.
</p><p>"Our student-athletes and all the kids involved had a great time."
</p><p>The free clinics are a benefit of the newly created Otter Pups Kids Club.
</p><p>Among the other benefits are free admission to all Otters' regular season home games (with a paying adult), a birthday card from the CSUMB mascot Monte Rey and autograph sessions with CSUMB student-athletes.
</p><p>To receive email notices of upcoming clinics, youngsters can sign up for the Otter Pups Kids Club at <a href="http://www.otterathletics.com" title="www.otterathletics.com">www.otterathletics.com</a>.
