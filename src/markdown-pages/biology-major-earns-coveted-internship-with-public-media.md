<p>As a child, Grace Singer explored tide pools on the Monterey Peninsula. She was hooked.
</p><p>That led to degrees in biology and chemistry at a local community college, an internship at Hopkins Marine Station and volunteer work at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Her goal is to pursue a career in science communication.
</p><p>With the help of generous donors, Singer is getting a head start on that career with a summer internship at KQED in San Francisco.
</p><p>The junior biology major is the winner of the Professor and Mrs. Allen Fuhs science communication scholarship and internship, each worth $10,000.
</p><p>This summer, Singer is working for KQED Science, which provides science and environment coverage from the Bay Area and beyond by the flagship Northern California PBS and NPR affiliates.
</p><p>“I’ll get a chance to participate in as many projects as I can handle,” she said. She’s primarily working for the video web series, Deep Look. “My responsibilities include researching new ideas, consulting with research specialists, editing, writing and co&#45;producing.” And she’s writing a blog for the KQED Science website.
</p><p>Her first <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/science/2015/06/16/100&#45;new&#45;marine&#45;species&#45;discovered&#45;in&#45;mysterious&#45;twilight&#45;zone/">story</a> explains how researchers from the California Academy of Sciences discovered more than 100 new species of marine animals off the coast of the Philippines.
</p><p>Singer applied for the scholarship to help with expenses for the international study program in Costa Rica she’ll attend in the fall.
</p><p>“I’ve always loved writing, editing and filmmaking, so it seemed like the perfect scholarship for my skill set,” she said. “I love working with others to spread awareness where it matters, and being privy to the latest scientific breakthroughs excites and motivates me.”
</p><p>She plans to apply to the science writing certificate program at UC Santa Cruz after she graduates.
</p><p><em>About the donor: Allen Fuhs, Ph.D., is a distinguished professor emeritus at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, where he chaired the mechanical engineering and aeronautics departments. Among his achievements, Dr. Fuhs was an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, one of the most prestigious honors in aerospace.</em>
