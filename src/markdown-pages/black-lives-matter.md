<h2>CSUMB community affirms support for racial justice, systemic change</h2>
<p>
  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., June 18, 2020</b> - Following multiple tragic deaths in
  the United States including George Floyd’s, President Eduardo M. Ochoa and
  many others at CSUMB have released statements decrying racism and committing
  to do more to fight it.
</p>
<p>
  Ochoa called systemic racism “a longstanding stain in our society” and pledged
  to deepen “our commitment to our values of respect, inclusion, and empathy.”
</p>
<p>
  “We need to redouble our efforts to meet that commitment together. We will
  take concrete steps to ensure that all our faculty and staff live by those
  values. We will also take concrete steps to ensure that the educational
  experience of our students truly uncovers and eradicates the unconscious (and
  conscious) biases we all have,” Ochoa wrote.
</p>
<p>
  Brian Corpening, associate vice president for the Office of Inclusive
  Excellence, called the deaths and the nationwide demonstrations that followed
  “another stark reminder of our continuing national failure to address issues
  of racial injustice.”
</p>
<p>
  “To erase the scourge of systemic racism requires that we are fully committed
  to providing our students with the capacity and commitment to be community
  builders and leaders in moving this society to a new day, a day in which the
  killing of an unarmed Black man by a member of law enforcement would be a
  disturbing relic of our past,” Corpening said.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB Police Chief Earl Lawson joined police chiefs from all 23 California
  State University campuses in banning chokeholds and pledging to implement
  policies recommended by a federal task force to ensure accountability, equity
  and justice.
</p>
<p>
  <b> </b>"We have seen the tragic impact of racism and bigotry, and many in our
  departments have experienced it personally. We are unitedly determined to take
  action," the police chiefs said.
