<p>Forty students, staff and faculty members of California State University, Monterey Bay turned out to donate blood Dec. 12, despite the crush of end-of-semester work.
</p><p>A donor team staffed by the American Red Cross spent the afternoon in the Alumni and Visitors Center as part of its holiday blood drive.
</p><p>They collected 30 units of blood. Some potential donors had to be turned away (or "deferred," as the Red Cross staff members said) for a variety of reasons - they've had a tattoo recently, they had a low blood count, were getting over a cold, etc.
</p><p>"We were pleased with the turnout," said Sherrie Pfefferkorn, charge nurse with the Red Cross. "We definitely plan on doing this again."
</p><p>Blood donation is an important way for healthy people to help their community. Blood cannot be manufactured; the only way to keep up with the demand is through regular donations from healthy volunteer donors.
</p><p>"I think everyone should help someone in some way. This is one of the easiest ways I can help someone," said freshman Emily Selander.
</p><p>The blood drive was co-sponsored by Omega Delta Phi-AK fraternity and its service chair, Efren Camacho; the Campus Health Center; and the Alumni and Visitors Center.
