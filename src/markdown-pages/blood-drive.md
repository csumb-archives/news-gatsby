<p>A donor team staffed by the American Red Cross spent the afternoon in the Alumni and Visitors Center as part of its holiday blood drive.
</p><p>They collected 30 units of blood. Some potential donors had to be turned away (or "deferred," as the Red Cross staff members said) for a variety of reasons - they've had a tattoo recently, they had a low blood count, were getting over a cold, etc.
</p><p>"We were pleased with the turnout," said Sherrie Pfefferkorn, charge nurse with the Red Cross. "We definitely plan on doing this again."
</p><p>Pfefferkorn explained that a unit of blood can potentially save three lives. Each donation is broken down into blood's component parts of plasma, hemoglobin and platelets. And each component can benefit a different person.
</p><p>Blood donation is an important way for healthy people to help their community. Blood cannot be manufactured; the only way to keep up with the demand is through regular donations from healthy volunteer donors.
</p><p>"I think everyone should help someone in some way. This is one of the easiest ways I can help someone," said freshman Emily Selander.
</p><p>Other members of the campus community agreed.
</p><p>Said Elizabeth Valle, a freshman VPA major, "I've always wanted to give blood. This is my first time. And it was easy."
</p><p>Donors showed up all afternoon. So many had made reservations online that no walk-ups could be accommodated. Despite the efficient operation, donors were still being processed more than an hour after the 3 p.m. advertised closing.
</p><p>Anyone who missed the chance to donate can visit the Blood Donor Center of Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, 576 Hartnell St., Monterey. To make an appointment, call 625-4814.
</p><p>The blood drive was co-sponsored by Omega Delta Phi-AK and its service chair, Efren Camacho; the Campus Health Center; and the Alumni and Visitors Center.
</p><p>The Red Cross will be back on campus four times in 2008: Feb. 20, April 23, Sept. 10 and Dec. 10.
