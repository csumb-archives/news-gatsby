<p>So you have an idea better than Velcro but don't know how to make it stick. Maybe you need an entrepreneurial kick in the butt. That's where Startup Weekend comes in. This week, CSU Monterey Bay is hosting Startup Weekend Google boot camp, sponsored by the tech giant, to gear up for the big show happening at the university in January. â€“ <em>Monterey County Weekly</em>, Nov. 29, 2012
