<p>Indian writer Murzban Shroff will visit Cal State Monterey Bay for a special presentation on Oct. 27.
</p><p>Shroff has published fiction in more than 50 journals in the United States and the United Kingdom. His debut story collection, <em>Breathless in Bombay</em>, was published in 2008 to great critical acclaim – it was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize – for its ability to capture the lives of the invisible and show a city in the throes of seismic modernization.
</p><p>The book is a mosaic of 14 short stories, each presenting a picture of life in one of India’s busiest cities. Shroff uses vivid imagery and powerful, descriptive prose; the reader is transported to Bombay &#40;Mumbai&#41;, with all its beautiful chaos and energy.

Reviewer Zarine Hakim Austin noted that “each story opens our eyes to another way of life, and though these lives may differ from our own, we feel a deep connection to the human condition . . . ”

At CSUMB, Shroff will talk on the topic “<em>Breathless in Bombay</em> – Challenges of Writing Outside One’s Milieu.” The talk will be held from 3 to 5 p.m. in the University Center ballroom. He’ll read from <em>Breathless in Bombay</em> and another one of his stories and will answer questions from the audience. A reception will follow.

Shroff spent 16 years in advertising, at multinational agencies Ogilvy &amp; Mather, McCann Erickson, and Grey Advertising, and then started his own company. A “lack of fulfillment” motivated him to return to writing.
</p><p>A post&#45;modernist novel set in Mumbai will be released later this year; he is currently at work on a third short story collection and a series of novellas.
</p><p>The talk is sponsored by the College of Business; the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; and the College of Health Sciences and Human Services.
