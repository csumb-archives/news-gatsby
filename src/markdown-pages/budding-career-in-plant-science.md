<p><strong>Internship paves way for CSUMB student</strong> If the veggies on your dinner plate are bacteria-free in future years, you might want to thank Stacy Mauzey, a biology major who will graduate today from CSU Monterey Bay and head to graduate school in search of potentially dangerous organisms. Mauzey sorted through multiple suitors and chose Washington State University, where she'll pursue her master's degree, en route to a doctorate, studying plant pathology. â€“ Monterey Herald, May 21, 2011
