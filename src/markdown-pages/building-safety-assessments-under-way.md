<p><a href="http://www.awareandprepare.org/news/october-is-fire-preparedness-month/">October is National Fire Preparedness Month</a>. CSU Monterey Bay uses it as an opportunity to perform safety assessments of campus buildings and to remind everyone to pay attention to safety issues.
</p><p>During the month, staff members from the Emergency Management/Health &amp; Safety Division of the University Police Department will visit all buildings in use on campus. The goal is to support the department's emergency preparedness and disaster readiness efforts as well as to meet regulatory compliance.
</p><p>They will conduct the assessments, along with each Building Emergency Coordinator. Using a checklist, they look for obvious fire and safety hazards that can be corrected.
</p><p>Assuring the safety of campus facilities protects everyone from illness and injury.
