<p>C.H. Robinson and FoodSource recently showed their support of CSU Monterey Bay with a donation to the university’s School of Business.
</p><p>FoodSource general manager Ray Griffin presented a check for $10,000 to Dr. Marylou Shockley, head of the business program, and other university officials at a ceremony on Feb. 13 in the university’s Alumni and Visitors Center. The money will be used for scholarships for students studying agribusiness, marketing and management.
</p><p>“We’re very pleased to be here to present this check,” said Ray Griffin, general manager of FoodSource, a C.H. Robinson company.
</p><p>Griffin told the group that FoodSource – which was started in Monterey 15 years ago – has 136 employees. Fifteen of them are from CSUMB.
</p><p>“CSUMB graduates bring an entrepreneurial spirit,” Griffin said. “The talents students bring are just what we’re looking for.”
</p><p>Said Dr. Shockley, “I want to thank C.H. Robinson for hiring our students. Jobs are so critical now . . . we want to be one of your sources of employees,” she told the company representatives in attendance.
</p><p>She shared her recollection of a student who was “gangly and running around in a T-shirt” who wanted to start a business club. That student, Wyatt Meiggs – now a member of the Alumni Association board – is employed by FoodSource and was in attendance. He and fellow alumnus Coy Williams were instrumental in securing the donation.
</p><p>Also in attendance were members of the School of Business Advisory Council.
</p><p>Robinson, a Minnesota-based international transportation firm that matches shippers with cargo carriers, is one of the world's largest third-party logistics companies. It has an office in Monterey.
</p><p>FoodSource is a leading produce supply chain expert, providing services and flexible solutions to retail, wholesale and foodservice operators.
</p><p>Through the company and its foundation, C.H. Robinson and its employees contribute millions of dollars annually to a variety of organizations.
