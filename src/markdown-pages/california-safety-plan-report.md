<p>Because the CSU understands the importance of safety information, each campus is now required to disclose statistics regarding a range of crimes as well as information on:
</p><p>• the availability and location of security personnel and how to summon help;
</p><p>• special safeguards that have been established for particular facilities or activities;
</p><p>• actions taken in the last 18 months to increase safety, and any changes in safety precautions expected to be made during the next two years.
</p><p>To meet this requirement, CSUMB’s police department has prepared a report on campus safety, called the California Safety Plan Report.
</p><p>The report must be posted online each year by Jan. 1 and copies made available on request.
</p><p>The 2015 report is now available for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwQ9X6pBRRUJMGRkX0Jia2kwQ1U/view">download</a>.
