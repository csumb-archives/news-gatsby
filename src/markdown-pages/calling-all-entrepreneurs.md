<p>The application deadline is fast approaching for the annual Startup Challenge.</p><p>The Challenge provides an opportunity for prospective entrepreneurs, start&#45;ups and emerging companies to showcase their ideas and business concepts. The Challenge connects regional entrepreneurs to each other, to funders, consultants, support programs and venture capitalists.
</p><p>The Challenge begins with a one&#45;page application and a five&#45;minute first&#45;round pitch presented to judges on March 27. Applicants are then selected to expand their ideas into a full 12&#45;page business plan, which they present to an investor panel at the final event on May 1 at Cal State Monterey Bay.

</p><p>The Challenge includes three divisions: Venture, for businesses intended to grow into large enterprises; Main Street, for small businesses; and Student, for high school through graduate students.
</p><p>WaterCity, a startup that aims to lower residential and commercial water bills, was last yearâ€™s winner in the venture category and is working on its first round of funding. Its founders, Jeff Langholz and Maeve Du Toit, hope to launch their company this year.
</p><p>Katie's Coldpress, a mobile organic food truck planned by Katie Raquel of Seaside, won the Main Street category and launched last fall. The student winner was Construction Connection, a proposal to start a website and use iPhone software to connect contractors locally with workers, and workers with jobs.
