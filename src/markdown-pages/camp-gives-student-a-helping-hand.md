<p>Ashley Rojas was nervous about attending college and scared of failing.
</p><p>But thanks to the College Assistance Migrant Program, she was able to get over her fears and get the support she needed to succeed.
</p><p>Ashley was the first in her family to attend college. The graduate of King City High School decided to enroll in CSUMB in the fall of 2009.
</p><p>“I can’t count the times I had ‘impostor syndrome,’ ” she said. “Failure was constantly in the back of my mind.”
</p><p>Ashley was recruited for the CAMP program before her freshman year. Like all CAMP students, she had access to tutoring, career exploration, cultural and social activities and follow-up support services through graduation.
</p><p>“CAMP was one of the programs that was the foudation and fundamental to my success at CSUMB,” she said. She then ticked off the kinds of support she received:
</p><p>• Summer Bridge – “Helped with my transition to college” • Math 98/99 workshop – “Saved my life!” • “An open door whenever I had questions or needed help”
</p><p>While in the program, she was selected to attend a conference in Washington, D.C. Two years later, that led to an internship in the nation’s capital.
</p><p>CSUMB has recently received a <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/jun/26/camp-grant-helps-migrant-students-attain-college-dream">$2.1 million grant</a> from the U.S. Department of Education to offer the program for five more years, serving 55 incoming students each year from Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara counties.
</p><p>First-generation college students face many hurdles. Among them are parents with no college experience, low family incomes, inadequate academic preparation and language barriers.
</p><p>The goal of the program is to create a paradigm shift in the minds of students and their parents that college is possible, and to provide the support they need to succeed once they arrive on campus.
</p><p>It worked for Ashley – she graduated in 2014 with a degree in collaborative health and human services and plans to attend graduate school after taking a year off. She’s hoping to use that year to teach English in South Korea.
