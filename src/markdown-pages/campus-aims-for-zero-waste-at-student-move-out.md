<p>Some CSU Monterey Bay students were surprised at what they saw discarded during last year’s spring rush to clean out dorm rooms and move off campus for the summer.
</p><p>“Students will leave all kinds of things,” said Max Lorenz, the student recycling coordinator. Spotted last year were video games, computers, television sets and refrigerators.
</p><p>But more than electronics get tossed aside. Clothing and other useful items are thrown in trash bins when they could be donated to organizations that serve the community.
</p><p>With that in mind, Lorenz helped to organize CSUMB’s zero waste move-out program, taking place May 16 through 18.
</p><p>Between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. on those days, students can follow the signs and sidewalk chalk markings to three sorting stations located between the residence halls on main campus and North Quad.
</p><p>During last year’s end-of-school event, 1,800 students moving out of the residence halls diverted 17 tons of recyclable and reusable material from the landfill.
</p><p>However, Lorenz pointed out, 16 tons of trash still found its way to the landfill – most of which was reusable or recyclable.
</p><p>Hope Services, a local nonprofit organization that provides support services for developmentally disabled people, will be on hand to collect:
</p><p>• E-waste: If it plugs in, working or not, it can be recycled • Reusable household items: Clothing, pots and pans, dishes, books, lamps, sporting goods, DVDs, clocks, luggage, picture frames
</p><p>Other items will be sorted into:
</p><p>• Furniture • Household hazardous waste: anything with “caution/warning/hazardous” on the label • Recyclables: Plastic, glass, paper/cardboard, cans
</p><p>The only items that should be going into trash bins are Styrofoam, broken glass and ceramics, and anything that has been contaminated with food (such as pizza boxes).
</p><p>Zero waste move-out is just one way students, staff and faculty members are working together to make CSUMB a more sustainable campus. To learn more about the university’s sustainability efforts, click <a href="http://ideals.csumb.edu/sustainability">here</a>.
