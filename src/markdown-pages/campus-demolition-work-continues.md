<p>The universityâ€™s efforts to create a safe and sustainable environment continue as demolition moves to the northeast area of campus.
</p><p>On Nov. 17, work will start on the corner of Inter&#45;Garrison Road and Seventh Avenue. Fencing will be installed around the demolition site; that will create minor changes in the traffic flow on parking lot 201.
</p><p>Last spring, demolition of eight buildings began between Sixth and Seventh avenues and Butler Street and Col. Durham Road.
</p><p>The contractor is obliged to reuse and recycle 90 percent of the materials from the demolished structures. Concrete recovered from the demolition will be pulverized and reused to create permeable surfaces that reduce storm water runoff.
