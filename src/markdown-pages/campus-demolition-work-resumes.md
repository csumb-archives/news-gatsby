</p><p>The university's efforts to create and support a sustainable environment continue as demolition work gets under way in the northwest sector of campus.
</p><p>This month, a total of 32 structures – buildings and ramps – will be taken down in the area used for parking during the annual AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf tournament. The area is between Eighth and Fifth streets (going north to south) and Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Second Avenue (east to west).
</p><p>Phase two of the project involves taking down two metal buildings immediately east of the Otter Sports Center – the Outdoor Recreation Center and an unused building. That project is scheduled to start June 3 and take about two weeks. The nearby Child Development Center will be unaffected.
</p><p>The contractor is obliged to reuse and recycle 90 percent of the materials from the demolished structures.
</p><p>Concrete recovered from the demolition of slabs and building foundations will be pulverized and reused to create permeable surfaces that reduce storm water runoff.
</p><p>Campus activities, air quality and traffic will not be impacted by the work.
