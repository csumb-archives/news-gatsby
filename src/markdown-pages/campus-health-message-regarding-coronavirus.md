  Your health is a critical factor in your success at CSU Monterey Bay. We are
  monitoring the outbreak of the 2019
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/">Novel Coronavirus</a>,
  first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Some isolated cases are
  reported in the United States, including the State of California. There are no
  confirmed cases in the CSUMB service area. Although the risk of infection with
  the virus is low for the average Californian, the
  <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-a-h/health"
    >Monterey County Health Department </a
  >urges schools to take steps now to be able to identify, isolate and report
  individuals potentially ill with the virus.
</p>
<p>
  To reduce the potential for illness, The California State University
  Chancellor’s Office issued a travel ban today for Hubei Province, China, and
  restricted all travel to the Peoples’ Republic of China to essential travel
  only for university-sponsored trips.
</p>
<p>
  If you have symptoms of influenza-like illness or other respiratory
  infections, please stay at home and do not come to campus for school or work.
  Also, contact your healthcare provider to seek medical attention as soon as
  you are able.
</p>
<p>
  Flu and other respiratory illnesses spread when someone with the illness
  coughs or sneezes, and another person inhales respiratory droplets or touches
  a contaminated surface such as a desk, door handle or keyboard and then
  touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
</p>
<p>Take these general precautions to avoid infection and stay healthy:</p>
<p>
  CSUMB students may seek medical attention from the Campus Health Center. If
  you are feeling unwell (fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
  headache, sore throat or nasal congestion) and you have traveled to Wuhan
  City, Hubei Province, China during the month of January, please wear a face
  mask and notify a member of the Campus Health Center team by calling
  831-582-3965. Please call ahead before visiting the Campus Health Center, a
  doctor’s office, an urgent care center, or a hospital emergency room.
</p>
<p>
  Additional information about the seasonal flu, including details about
  symptoms and prevention, is available via the Campus Health Center’s
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/health/flu-information/">Flu Information</a>
  webpage. Current information about the coronavirus is available on the CDC’s
