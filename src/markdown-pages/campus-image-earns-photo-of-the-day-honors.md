<p>A shot of the North Quad student housing complex has won Photo of the Day honors in the Monterey Herald’s CaptureMonterey contest.
</p><p>Library circulation services manager Dennis Sun took the photo, Walking in a Fog, on the evening of July 5. The fog distorts the glow cast by outdoor lighting fixtures, giving the image an eerie feel.
</p><p>“I captured this photo on a dark, foggy night during the summer break when there were no traffic distractions,” Sun said.
</p><p>“The stillness and blur reminded me of a surreal vision, like we see in a dream.”
</p><p>Sun is best known for his photos documenting the history of Fort Ord. Since 1996, he has taken thousands of images of the former Army base, and has exhibited them locally since 2002.
</p><p>His passion for photography and history has motivated him to keep taking photographs of the area. Sun, who served in the Air Force and the Air National Guard, said his photos are his way of honoring the people who served in the military.
