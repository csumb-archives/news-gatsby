<p>Throughout 2015, Cal State Monterey Bay will work to update its campus master plan. The master plan provides a road map for growth and renewal of the campus; it considers the academic environment, student and residential life, mobility and infrastructure systems, and connections with our neighboring communities.
</p><p>Page/BMS Design Group of SanFrancisco has been hired to lead the process.
</p><p>Student voices are important in this process. Students can share their thoughts on the future of the campus at an open house with the design group from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., April 29, in the East Lounge of the Student Center. Pizza will be provided.
</p><p>Faculty and staff members are invited to attend one of two sessions on April 30 to share their thoughts. Session one will be held from 11 a.m. to noon; session two will run from noon to 1 p.m. Both will be held in the Alumni and Visitors Center.
</p><p>More sessions will be held in the fall.
</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: From the April sessions came ways to "tell us what you think!" Email to masterplan@csumb.edu or tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/PageThink">@PageThink</a> using #CSUMBmp
