<p>Herschel Walker believes it's his responsibility to help</p><p>Former NFL running back Herschel Walker will make a stop at the Gen. Stilwell Community Center on July 15 to share his story about overcoming challenges and building resilience.

The Presidio of Montereyâ€™s Army Substance Abuse Program has extended an invitation to the CSUMB community to join them at this free event.

An athlete, author and businessman, Walker visits military installations to share his personal story and experience with mental illness while delivering an important message.

During a talk at Travis Air Force base last fall, Walker told the crowd, "If you're hurting for something, don't be ashamed to get help. I'm not any weaker or less of a person because I got help."

The event will be held from 1 to 1:45 p.m. Walker will sign autographs after his presentation.

The Gen. Stilwell Community Center is located at the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Gigling Road, across from the gas station.
