</p><p>In a continued effort to prevent the spread of H1N1 flu, CSU Monterey Bay has installed a dozen hand-sanitizing stations around campus. The dispensers are motion-activated, automatically releasing an alcohol-based antiseptic gel when a user places his hands underneath one.
</p><p>The gel doesn't replace hand-washing, but it is a quick way to disinfect hands when soap and water are unavailable, according to Diane Ehlers, CSUMB's director of environmental protection, health and safety.
</p><p>The dispensers are located in:
</p><p>Sodexo has installed a hand-sanitizing station at the Dining Commons. Stations will also be placed in the Otter Express, library cafe and the Otter Bay Restaurant by the end of next week. Two extra dispensers are on hand and will be put in place when a crowd is expected at a certain location, such as the World Theater on the evening of a performance.
</p><p>The dispensers are part of CSUMB's ongoing efforts to combat the flu. The university has set up a website (<a href="http://csumb.edu/flu">csumb.edu/flu</a>) with information on how to prevent and treat the flu; emails with that information have gone out to everyone on campus; and all rooms in the residence halls have received informational fliers. Vinyl signs will soon be displayed in campus restrooms.
</p><p>The objective is to encourage everyone on campus to wash their hands frequently, cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, and stay home when sick.
