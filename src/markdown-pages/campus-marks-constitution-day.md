<p>How often do university students, grade-school children, federal office workers and CIA agents all receive a lesson on the same topic?
</p><p>Not often, but that's what is going to happen later this month.
</p><p>The lesson will cover the U.S. Constitution, courtesy of a new law sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.). An appropriations bill approved by Congress last year contained a requirement that every school or university that receives federal money present a program on the Constitution. The law also requires that each of the nearly two million federal workers receive educational materials about the charter on Constitution Day, a day celebrating the Sept. 17, 1787, signing.
</p><p>If the day falls on a weekend, as it does this year, schools can celebrate it the week before or the week after.
</p><p>CSUMB will implement the law on Sept. 19 with a panel discussion about the relationship between the Constitution and the confirmation process of a Supreme Court justice.
</p><p>Former Congressman Leon Panetta will moderate the discussion. Participants include Congressman Sam Farr, Assemblyman Simon Salinas, local attorney and civil liberties activist Michelle Welsh and Judge Marla Anderson.
</p><p>The event will be held from 6 to 7:30 p.m. in the University Center and is open to the public.
</p><p>According to published reports, Sen. Byrd was motivated to introduce the law by surveys showing that many Americans have a better understanding of the intricacies of "American Idol" than they do about the foundations of their government.
