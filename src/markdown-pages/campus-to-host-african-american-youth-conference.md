</p><p><strong>Aug. 7 event features filmmaker Reggie Bullock</strong>
</p><p>"Learn Today, Lead Tomorrow" will be the theme of the Central Coast African American youth conference to be held on Aug. 7 at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Sponsored by the 100 Black Men of the Monterey Peninsula and California State University, Monterey Bay, the free, daylong event is aimed at African Americans between 12 and 18 years old and their parents.
</p><p>Filmmaker Reggie Bullock will give the keynote address. His film, <em>A War for Your Soul</em>, encourages adults to play a more active role in educating children. The film was released over the Internet in March of 2009; since then, over 7 million people have viewed it. It was originally targeted toward at-risk African American youth, but many viewers are left asking themselves, "How can I help my community?"
</p><p>Registration will get under way at 7:30 a.m., followed by breakfast at 8:30. The program will begin at 9 o'clock in the World Theater. At 9:30, the students will move to classrooms in nearby buildings to attend a variety of workshops, while parents will stay in the theater for their own set of workshops.
</p><p>A catered lunch will be available from noon to 1 p.m., followed by Mr. Bullock's presentation and film showing.
</p><p>To reserve a space, call 794-8485 by Aug. 2.
</p><p>Chartered in 2007, the 100 Black Men of the Monterey Peninsula chapter has committed to providing focused, effective, and participatory leadership in communities throughout the greater Monterey Peninsula area.
