<p>CSU Monterey Bay alumna Erika D’Auria has turned her capstone project into an exhibit at the Monterey Museum of Art.
</p><p>D’Auria (VPA 2014) is the guest curator of <em>Define:/self/ – Exploring Female Identity</em>, which opens July 11 at the museum’s Pacific Street location.
</p><p>The exhibit showcases the work of 20 female artists from the Youth Arts Collective, a Monterey-based artists' studio for 14- to 22-year-olds. They responded to the prompt, “What does it mean to be a female artist,” creating a multi-media exhibition. The work explores the idea of womanhood, self-identity and how the artists choose to define themselves.
</p><p>Photographs of the artists accompany their work.
</p><p>D’Auria interviewed each artist, asking her if she thought females are at a disadvantage being a woman in a man’s art world.
</p><p>D’Auria told the Monterey Herald that the young artists felt they might not have the same opportunities. But, she said, “They are realistic about their futures. It’s not a deterrent but a motivator.”
</p><p>The VPA graduate told the Herald that she was inspired to create the show in part because of her sisters, ages 9 and 10.
</p><p>The exhibit will be on display through July 21. The museum is located at 559 Pacific St., Monterey. <a href="http://www.montereyart.org">Find more information here</a>.
