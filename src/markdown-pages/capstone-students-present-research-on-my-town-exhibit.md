  SEASIDE, Ca., December 4, 2019 – The<b> </b>MY Town Pop-up Children’s Museum
  launched at the CSUMB Salinas City Center during the summer of 2019. The
  exhibition provided a free children’s museum for Salinas and saw nearly 6,000
  attendees. It also functioned as a research space for CSUMB students.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to being the inaugural space for the traveling MY Town exhibition,
  CSUMB involved <a href="https://csumb.edu/psychology">Psychology</a> and
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc"
    >Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center </a
  >(UROC) programs. Students conducted research and assessment of the
  exhibition’s success and how children and families from Monterey County
  interact. The data collected through this learning experience was also used to
  improve the exhibition in real-time.

<p>
  Led by

    >CSUMB Psychology Professor Jennifer Dyer-Seymour</a
  >, CSUMB students presented their research on December 4, 2019 at CSUMB
  Salinas City Center and answered questions about the impact of the exhibit on
  kinder readiness, cultural differences in how parents interact with children
  and more.
</p>
<p>
  For the CSUMB students, this project was the first step in developing a better
  understanding of how children are learning in and out of school environments,
  such as MY Town.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB at Salinas City Center was only the first stop for MY Town. After its
  incubation at CSUMB, the organizers are hopeful this can move throughout the
  county and are looking for additional sponsors and potential host sites to
  bring this experience to more children and families.
