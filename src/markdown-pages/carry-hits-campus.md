<p>Packages now delivered by self-driving vehicle</p><p>CSUMB, meet Carry.
</p><p>Carry is a small, self&#45;driving delivery vehicle developed by Dispatch that moves in pedestrian spaces. Since early March, Carry has been traveling campus walkways to help deliver packages to various offices.
</p><p>At about three feet long and tall, and not as wide as a wheelchair, it’s small enough to easily navigate the campus. Carry is electric powered and moves at a maximum of 4.5 miles per hour, but always at a pace that ensures the safety of those surrounding it while still completing deliveries efficiently.
</p><p>A company representative monitors the unit within 40 feet, and can stop it if needed.
</p><p>Similar to the way self&#45;driving cars navigate roads, Carry uses its sensors to understand and interact with the environment around it.
</p><p>South San Francisco&#45;based Dispatch is working to expose Carry to different environments and situations. A college campus like CSUMB allows the company to test the vehicle’s autonomous navigation technology in areas with pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
</p><p>The project will run at CSUMB through mid&#45;August, and as part of the collaboration, the Dispatch team is working with the CST 499 class and mentoring a student capstone project.
</p><p>Questions? Feel free to reach out directly to the Dispatch team at info@dispatchrobotics.com.
