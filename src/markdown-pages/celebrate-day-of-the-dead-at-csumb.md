<p>When Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, arrives, family members of departed souls set out water, candles, food and decorated sugar skulls to welcome their lost loved ones. Widely celebrated in Latin America, the day honors the dead as living entities. It celebrates the departed, and helps keep them present in life.
</p><p>This year's Dia de los Muertos celebration at California State University, Monterey Bay, will be held on Nov. 2.
</p><p>The free event will begin at 6 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue with performances by Aztec dancers and musicians and will include a processional, an outdoor exhibition, live music, pan dulce and hot chocolate. The main altar will be displayed in the University Center ballroom; smaller altars constructed by student and community groups will also be on display.
</p><p>Members of the community are invited to honor the memory of their departed relatives and friends by registering them for the university's Wall of Remembrance. A photo, name and brief memorial message can be submitted at <a href="http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm">http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm</a>. Photos, which should be submitted in jpg format no larger than 500kb, will be printed and displayed on our Wall of Remembrance and a candle in each name will be placed on the large community altar.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map. More information is available at csumb.edu/art.
