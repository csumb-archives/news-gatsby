  CSUMB celebrates international education week with a week of events showcasing
  cultures from around the world and honoring the diversity on our own campus.
  CSUMB hopes to shine light on the powerful role that international education
  plays in a university setting by empowering diverse thought, sharing cultural
  traditions and ideologies and creating a welcoming and inclusive space for all
  people.

  Hosting open community events is in keeping with CSUMB’s role as a community
  resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought
  and action on issues important to our community.
