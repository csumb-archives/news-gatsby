<p>This semester’s Entrepreneurship Forum at Cal State Monterey Bay, set for Feb. 11, features a discussion on the challenges and rewards women face in startups and tech companies.</p><p>The small number of women in tech companies and startups has been the subject of much discussion in the media and in the companies themselves. The increasing importance of the technology sector in the economy makes this a challenge that must be addressed. The forum will look at ways to encourage women and to create more opportunities to participate in these companies.

</p><p>• Theresa Ream, owner of Disaster Kleenup Specialists, Excel Carpet Care, Cypress Cabinets and Floor Store USA
</p><p>• Catherine Mikkelson, founder of Brain Parenting; partner of BrindleLabs; co&#45;founder of The Memphis Project
</p><p>• Catherine Hambley, Ph.D., senior consultant to the Academy of Brain&#45;Based Leadership; coach of  several TED talk presenters; executive coach/facilitator/trainer at the NeuroLeadership Institute
