<h3>Guitar-percussion duo proves that chamber music is far from stuffy</h3><p><a href="http://thelivingearthshow.com">The Living Earth Show</a> – electric guitarist Travis Andrews and percussionist Andy Meyerson – will perform at CSU Monterey Bay on Dec. 5.
</p><p>The public is invited to attend this free concert at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here.</a>
</p><p>The Living Earth Show has been called “a vanguard effort of new chamber music” and “energetically provocative” by the San Francisco Examiner and “a much sought&#45;after presence on the indie classical scene” by the arts website San Francisco Classical Voice.
</p><p>Andrews and Meyerson have developed a reputation as one of the most versatile contemporary chamber groups on the West Coast. The duo thrives on pushing the boundaries of technical and artistic possibility in its presentation of commissioned electro&#45;acoustic chamber music. The concert is the final event in the <a href="http://csumb.edu/music">Music and Performing Arts Department</a>'s lecture/demonstration series for the fall semester.
</p><p>While the concert is free, a parking permit is required and can be purchased <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy&#45;permit">online</a>.
