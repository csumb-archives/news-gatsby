<p>It has gone from a dream, to a grant ($600,000 last year) and now the Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum and project is taking an important next step. CSU Monterey Bay will host a symposium featuring national museum professionals who will share their experiences and lend their advice on how to best plan and create the Salinas museum. â€“ <em>Monterey Herald</em>, Oct. 14, 2010
