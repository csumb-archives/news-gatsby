The Buddhist Temple, the Confucius Church and the Filipino Cultural Center will open their doors to the community. Asian cuisine will be available. Guided tours of the area will leave the Confucius Church on the hour. The Asian Festival is an effort to unite three ethnic communities – Chinese, Japanese and Filipino – as they share their history and culture in one of Salinas' most historic areas. The festival will be held in the area bordered by California, Soledad, Lake and Calle Cebu streets. The festival is part of CSU Monterey Bay’s Chinatown Renewal Project, which is leading the effort to revitalize a marginalized area of Salinas. Since 2006, the revitalization process has included a neighborhood garden and community learning center and the @risk Art Gallery, a project of the Franciscan Workers.The community is invited to this free event.
