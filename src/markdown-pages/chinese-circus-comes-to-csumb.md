<p>WORLD THEATER SEASON OPENS WITH SEPT. 15 PERFORMANCE</p><p>In past years, CSU Monterey Bay’s World Theater has brought Chinese acrobats and circus performers to the area. This year, it’s acrobats <em>and</em> the circus.
</p><p>On Sept. 15, the National Circus and Acrobats of the People’s Republic of China will kick off this year’s Performing Arts series. The company, founded in 1953, combines elements of Peking opera and martial arts, introduced the concept of a circus without animals, and inspired the pioneers of Cirque du Soleil.
</p><p>The program features “Peking Dreams.” It was performed at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and has been presented in Europe and Asia. This year, it’s touring North America and the World Theater was successful in securing the Central California tour date.

The whole family will enjoy the feats of balance, juggling, flying and contortion put on by the ensemble of gymnasts, jugglers and dancers who bend and flex their bodies in ways that seem to defy human anatomy. Dazzling costumes and music add to the spectacle.

“We booked the circus to bring an art form to our audience that has been part of the Chinese culture for centuries,” said Joe Cardinalli, artistic and executive director, University Performances and Special Events. “The circus performances were once reserved for emperors and their courts, and now we can be astounded by the performances right here on the Cal State Monterey Bay campus.

“This is the World Theater's 15th year of presenting acts from around the world. This performance is part of the Golden Passport Series, giving our audience the opportunity to see international shows. It’s how we celebrate the world’s arts here at the World Theater," Cardinalli said.
