<h3>Scholar from India visits campus, collaborates on research</h3><p>In February, CSU Monterey Bay’s College of Business welcomed its first visiting scholar.
</p><p>Dr. Ganesh Sahu may be the first international researcher to visit, but he’s not likely to be the last.
</p><p>“His Asian and global perspective will enrich the learning and knowledge of our students and internationalize their outlook and education,” said Dr. Shyam Kamath, dean of CSUMB’s <a href="http://business.csumb.edu">College of Business.</a>
</p><p>Dr. Sahu comes from the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Allahabad, India, where he is an associate professor of management and computer information systems. His visit to CSUMB was made possible by the Indian government through a program – similar to Fulbright Awards – that provides scholars an opportunity to conduct research and to forge relationships with experts in the United States.
</p><p>While on campus, he will give research seminars and presentations and lecture in business classes.
</p><p>Dr. Sahu will give a research presentation at noon, April 17, in Valley Hall, Room A116.  
</p><p>Dr. Sahu’s current research involves a study of comparative e-government in India and the United States. He is working on a project with Dean Kamath and several faculty members, including Dr. Babita Gupta, who was instrumental in bringing him to campus.
</p><p>E-government is a global phenomenon. Simply defined, it is the use of technology to provide information for citizens, allowing them easy access to government services, and allowing them to transact business with their government.
</p><p>According to Dr. Kamath, a long-term relationship with the National Institute of Technology will be explored. Future exchanges with management schools in Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America are under discussion.
