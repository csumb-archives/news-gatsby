<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s concert series resumes on Oct. 13 with a free performance by A/B Duo.
</p><p>Included in the program is a new piece for contrabass flute and percussion written by Monterey County native Ned McGowan.
</p><p>A/B Duo – percussionist Christopher Jones and flutist Meerenai Shim – performs contemporary music. Part garage band, part Bang on a Can All Stars, they commission most of the music they perform. It varies wildly in style and instrumentation – from djembe and contrabass flute to Nintendo Gameboy and drum set.
</p><p>One of the most charming concerts imaginable. . . . The music was bouncy, strange, interesting and fun. A/B Duo is worth seeking out. – Civic Center Blog (San Francisco)
</p><p>“There are so many possibilities with the combination of flute and percussion, with all of the percussion instruments, and I also have five flutes that I can use – piccolo, flute, alto flute, bass flute and contra-bass flute,” Shim told a reviewer for the website Cleveland Classical.com. “And stylistically speaking, some people describe what Chris and I do as chamber rock. I’ve heard others say it’s a combination of popular music and art music,” Shim said.
</p><p>“Things We Dream About,” their rock and roll and Gameboy infused extended play record, was released in December 2013. The duo is currently recording its first full-length album, tentatively titled “Ricochet,” to be released in fall 2015. The free concert will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue and Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus map can be found at csumb.edu/maps. Please note that a parking permit must be purchased from a machine on the adjacent lot or <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy-permit">online</a>.
