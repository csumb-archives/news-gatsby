<p><i>This message was sent to all students on Monday, March 16, 2020.</i></p>
<p>
  As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we continue to provide information to you
  as quickly as it is available. To protect our community, we are implementing a
  series of changes to campus and instructional operations.
</p>
<h3>Campus Community</h3>
<p>
  <b
    >CSUMB students should plan to attend the remainder of the spring semester
    virtually, receiving instruction at their permanent home residence.
    Exceptions to this are those students who need to be on campus for enrolled
    lab or studio courses and any student who feels safer in university housing.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >Students who feel safer in university housing are welcome to stay on
    campus.</b
  >
  This includes any student concerned about securing other housing options, or
  those who may have limited access to technology or the internet.
</p>
<p>
  Residence halls and campus dining venues remain open and operational with
  social distancing. As stated previously, all current residents who feel they
  need to stay are welcome to stay on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Students who live on campus who do not intend to return to campus for the
  semester should take their belongings and complete an

<h3>Reduced campus operation during suspended classes</h3>
<p>
  Beginning Tuesday, non-essential university staff members will work remotely,
  reducing some on-campus operations and services. This move prioritizes the
  health and safety of the CSUMB community while classes are suspended
</p>
<h3>Library and Student Center changes through March 22</h3>
<p>
  The Student Center is also open, weekdays 7 a.m. - 8 p.m. and weekends 10 a.m.
  - 8 p.m. The furniture in public locations is rearranged to accommodate health
  and safety standards; please leave it in place. Student Life is creating
  virtual engagement opportunities to maintain connections with all students.
  Please check the <a href="https://csumb.edu/studentlife">website</a> for
  creative activities and ways to participate during this time.
</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
  All campus events are suspended, regardless of size. Student groups may meet
  virtually using Zoom or other technology to maintain contact. The Otter Sports
  Center and Aquatics Center are closed until further notice.

  notice.

<h3>Student-workers</h3>

  Student employees may continue to work remotely for the respective department.
  If remote work is not possible, they will be paid for the hours they were
  scheduled to work. This is only through March 27. Students who work for a
  third party contractor such as Aâ€™viands or UG2, need to check with your
  employer for specific details.
