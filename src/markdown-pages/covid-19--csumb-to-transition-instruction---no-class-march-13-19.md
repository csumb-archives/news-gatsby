  assess the evolving situation with COVID-19. I commend the work of our
  excellent faculty and staff. Their efforts to support our students have
  prepared us to operate the university under any conditions, including
  delivering classes in alternate modalities.

  consider new information and advice. In light of Governor Newsom’s
  announcement and additional information related to potential cases in our
  county, now is the time to act.

  if you are ill or symptomatic, do not come to work or class.

  I encourage all members of the CSUMB community to continue to treat each other
  with compassion and respect as we manage this difficult situation and to stay
  aware by regularly visiting the

  By April 15, we will assess the situation, including plans for commencement,
