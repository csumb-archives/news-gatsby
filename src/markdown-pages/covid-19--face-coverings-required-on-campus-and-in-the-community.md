  Beginning April 30, 2020, the
  <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/Home/Components/News/News/7283/1336"
    >Monterey County Health Officer</a

  requires that all members of the public and workers must wear face coverings
  when not at home. The Shelter-at-Home order and the requirement to maintain at
  least six feet of social distance from others when out of your home for
  essential activities remain in effect. All workers and members of the public
  must wear a face covering when outside, which includes covering both the nose
  and mouth. This is in addition to frequent handwashing and heightened hygiene
  procedures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

  The CDC, California Department of Health, and the Monterey County Health
  Department believe that <b>wearing a face-covering </b>when combined with
  <b>physical-distancing of at least six feet</b> and
  <b>frequent handwashing</b>, may
  <b>reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus</b>. View the

  order online. Failure to comply with the order may include penalties under
  law.
</p>
<p>
  Surgical masks and N-95 respirators are critical supplies that must continue
  to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as
  recommended by current CDC guidance.
</p>
<h3>University Employees</h3>
<p>
  All University and Corporation employees who work on campus are required to
  wear a face-covering when at work. The only exception is if an employee is
  alone in an office with the door closed and not in contact with any other
  employee, student, or member of the public.
</p>
<p>
  The University and Corporation will supply face coverings for all essential
  employees on campus. Managers have instructions for requesting facial covering
  supplies.
</p>
<p>
  Essential employees on campus who do not have face coverings should contact
  their manager, and CSUMB will supply them as needed.
</p>
<h3>Students</h3>
<p>
  All on-campus students are required to wear a face-covering when not alone
  inside their respective residence. Students who do not have face covering may

    >make their own</a
  >. If a student needs supplies to make a face-covering email the
  <a href="mailto:lewilliams@csumb.edu">Dean of Students</a> to arrange a
  pick-up time.
  <b>Students must wear face-coverings on-campus, including when</b>:

  even if they are not currently residing on the CSUMB campus. Once the form is
  submitted, the student should expect a call from the Campus Health Center.
</p>
<p>
  Members of the public should not visit the CSUMB campus unless on official
  business with the university. All individuals on campus are expected to wear a
  face covering.
</p>

  practices to enhance our public health efforts. Stay updated on the COVID-19
