  This message was sent to all students, faculty, and staff on Tuesday, March
  17, 2020.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB is working closely with public health officials to assess the evolving
  situation with COVID-19. As many of you know, today, the
  <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-a-h/health/"
    >Monterey County Health Department</a
  >
  confirmed two cases of COVID-19 in Monterey County and issued a
  <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/home/showdocument?id=87957"
    >notice of “shelter in place”</a
  >
  for Monterey County residents.
</p>
<p>
  We will be providing substantially more guidance for faculty, staff, and
  students in the coming days, but in response to the change in status prompted
  by the “shelter in place” order, we felt it appropriate to provide some
  updates on issues of immediate concern. Underlying all of these is the precept
  that our primary concern must continue to be for the health and safety of the
  students, faculty, and staff at CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  <b
    ><i
      >The first thing we need to convey is that the “shelter in place” order is
      an Order issued under the authority of California law. Residents of
      Monterey County (including all students housed at CSUMB) are required to
      comply and it is a misdemeanor crime not to follow the order.</i
    ></b
  >
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s mandate in the face of the “shelter in place” order is to continue to
  lower the density of the on-campus population and reduce the potential of
  spreading COVID-19. To that end, the following changes are
  <b>effective immediately: </b>
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >Because of the needed time for preparation, the start date for alternative
    instruction is moved from Friday, March 20th to Monday, March 23rd.
    Additionally, <i>all</i> academic instruction, including labs and studio
    classes, will move to alternate modalities when classes resume on March
    23rd.</b
  >
  CSUMB students should plan to attend the remainder of the spring semester
  virtually, receiving instruction at their permanent home residence. This now
  includes labs, studio classes, and any heretofore face-to-face form of
  instruction.
</p>
<p>
  <b
    >Our campuses must significantly reduce student and employee populations,
    including campus housing communities.
  </b>
</p>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>
  Students are strongly encouraged to return home as soon as possible, and
  campus housing will facilitate the quick and orderly departure of students
  from campus housing. As per current refund policies, students who leave will
  obtain prorated refunds for housing and meal plans (although some procedures
  will be modified to comply with Shelter in Place rules). Residence halls will
  remain open and operational with mandated social distancing, and students who
  feel safer in university housing will be allowed to stay on campus. Be
  advised, food service is likely to experience some reduction in service in
  terms of venues and hours of operation, but CSUMB will continue to provide a
  more limited form of food service to students remaining on campus. Effective
  tomorrow, March 18th, the CSUMB Student Center will be closed, and Starbucks
  will be closed. It is unlikely that these venues will reopen before April 9th
  or the lifting of the “shelter in place” order.
</p>
<h4>University employees</h4>
<p>
  All faculty and staff who have been requested to work remotely should continue
  to work remotely through April 9th or until the “shelter in place” order is
  lifted. Employees will receive email instructions on remote work arrangements
  and procedures. Employees who were notified they are essential on-campus staff
  (need to come to campus for work) should continue to report to work on campus,
  observing social distancing techniques, and heightened personal hygiene
  procedures. Campus will continue to operate on a limited basis, and most
  university buildings will be closed. All emergency personnel will remain in
  place to maintain a safe campus community. There will be updates forthcoming
  on issues such as administrative leave.
</p>
<h3>Emergency Notification</h3>
<p>
  The university is required to issue a notification due to the two confirmed
  cases of COVID-19 in Monterey County.
</p>
<p>
  The CDC states that the best way to prevent illness is to
  <b>avoid being exposed</b> to this virus. The virus is thought to
  <b>spread mainly from person-to-person </b>and between people who are in close
  contact with one another, within about 6 feet. There is currently no vaccine
  to prevent COVID-19 infection.
</p>
<p>
  The Monterey County Health Department recommends that the best way to prevent
  infection with COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses is to take everyday,
  sensible steps, including:
</p>
<p>
  Stay updated on the COVID-19 situation as it evolves on the CSUMB
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/health/coronavirus-information">webpage</a> and
  from public health agencies, including the
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We appreciate the community’s flexibility and understanding as we adapt to a
  rapidly changing environment. We understand there are many unresolved
  questions associated with these latest measures. We will endeavor to
  communicate frequently with the CSUMB community as we flesh out the details
  and as new developments arise.
