  Today Chancellor White announced to the California State trustees that it
  would be irresponsible to bring the system’s nearly 500,000 students back to
  the 23 campuses in the fall. He said that the system is preserving as many
  options for as many students as possible but that university officials are
  planning for a worst-case scenario and hoping that the universities can
  conduct limited safe on-campus operations.
</p>
<p>
  As I have stated in recent meetings, open forums, and in my student office
  hours broadcast live on Facebook, I share your concerns for the safety of our
  students and your families and understand the anxiety created by the
  uncertainty about how the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to evolve. I also
  mentioned that we have been in ongoing deliberations with the senior
  leadership of the CSU system and evaluating various scenarios for fall
  classes. Consistent with the CSU guidelines and examining the information that
  we have today, we have concluded that social distancing, testing, contact
  tracing, isolation, and quarantine requirements would make a return to a
  face-to-face learning environment not feasible for our campus. Therefore,
  <b
    >CSUMB’s course delivery method will be through virtual instruction for the
    fall 2020 term</b
  >, with few limited exceptions for in-person instructional and research
  activities that cannot be delivered in an alternate modality and are essential
  to the university’s core mission. For these activities, we will maintain
  rigorous standards of health and safety. Additional details about the fall
  2020 semester--including the specific activities to be excepted, plans for
  student services, and status of on-campus housing, dining, and athletic
  programs--will be provided by May 18.
</p>
<p>
  Students are encouraged to stay engaged and enrolled in their programs of
  study as this will maintain their student status and continue to assure those
  degree requirements remain the same. Students that remain enrolled and in good
  standing will be best able to progress unimpeded toward the timely completion
  of their degrees.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty will be provided additional tools and resources to prepare for
  enhanced virtual instruction in the fall, including training and professional
  development in the summer. We will continue to provide high-quality learning
  opportunities for students, and we will support our faculty in adapting to
  these alternative approaches to teaching.
</p>
<p>
  The health and safety of the CSUMB community remain our highest priority.
  Accordingly, we will continue to follow the guidance of our state and local
  health officials as conditions unfold.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your continued dedication to the educational mission of CSUMB,
  and to our students.
