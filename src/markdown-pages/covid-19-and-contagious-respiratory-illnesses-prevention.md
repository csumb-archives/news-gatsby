  California State University, Monterey Bay, is actively planning and preparing
  for conditions that may disrupt normal campus operations. Your health and
  safety are our priority. Recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention (CDC) indicate that the community spread of COVID-19 is likely
  to occur in the United States. To date, there are no confirmed cases in
  Monterey County.
</p>

  for the prevention of contagious respiratory illnesses like the flu. Some of
  these steps include:

  The CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks for general prevention from
  respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Regular hand-washing provides better
  protection.

<p><b>Our values</b></p>
<p>
  CSUMB values openness and inclusion. We activate and support engaged learning,
  civic engagement, and sustained dialogues across identities and differences on
  our campus; it is who we are. The emergence of COVID-19 has fostered
  unwarranted anti-Asian/Asian-American sentiments across the nation. The CSUMB
  community does not accept these xenophobic behaviors expressed through speech,
  harassment, the spreading of misinformation, or misinformed decision-making.
