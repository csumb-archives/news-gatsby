<h3>CSUMB joins statewide message of hope</h3><p>California State University campuses throughout the state are holding candle-lighting events this month to send a message of support, understanding and comfort to those who have been impacted by suicide or other mental health-related challenges.
</p><p>The community is invited to attend Cal State Monterey Bay’s event from 7 to 9 p.m., Oct. 14, on the campus quad. It will be an opportunity to light a candle, write a message, pick up information and help to create a thousand lights for all of us.
</p><p>Why light a candle? Can a candle really say something or change anything?
</p><p>Yes.
</p><p>“This candle will be your voice in the darkness for those who feel misunderstood, alone, ashamed, guilty, sad or hopeless,” said Gary Rodriguez, health promotion and prevention specialist at CSUMB. “It will say, ‘You matter to me. I may not know exactly what to say or what to do, but here is what my heart wants to say.’ ”
</p><p>Rodriguez points out that the pain, isolation, suffering and other effects of mental health problems will be most effectively reduced by a caring, informed and connected community. “We are creating a strong, unified statement through the thousands of lights,” he said.
</p><p>For more information, contact Rodriguez at 582-4437.
