</p><p>***Ukrainian dance company comes to the World Theater ***
</p><p>Imagine colorful costumes and leaping dancers exploding across the stage and you have a hint of what the Virsky Ukrainian National Dance Company will bring to California State University, Monterey Bay's World Theater at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 22 as the Performing Arts Series opens its ninth season.
</p><p>Ukraine didn't become an independent country until 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union, but the culture of the Ukrainian people has been evolving for more than a thousand years. Much of what Americans think of as "Russian" - borscht, elaborately decorated Easter eggs and Cossack dances, for example - is actually Ukrainian.
</p><p>The 15 pieces on the program - and the company that includes 70 dancers and 10 musicians - will provide a visual delight. Each piece features brilliantly colored costumes that reflect the various traditions of this country that borders Romania, Poland, Russia and the Black Sea, and dancers that careen around the stage in the 18th-century equivalent of break dancing. The dances are romantic, optimistic, humorous and occasionally melancholy.
</p><p>Ballet master Pavlo Virsky founded the company in 1937 to preserve the folk dances of his country. No "folk" ever danced like this, of course. The company is made up of highly skilled professional dancers with a great deal of ballet training. Dance lovers will appreciate the athleticism and technical brilliance on display.
</p><p>Since 1980, Myroslav Vantukh, a choreographic ethnographer, has served as artistic director of the company his mentor created. He has made it a showcase for national pride.
</p><p>The company last toured North America in 2004, with appearances at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago. This fall, it will perform in 67 cities in the United States and Canada.
</p><p>"The Virsky Ukrainian National Dance Company is one of the most exciting ethnic dance companies in the world, and we're delighted to have them at CSU Monterey Bay," said World Theater Director Joe Cardinalli.
</p><p>"It's a big, colorful show that will appeal to a wide variety of people," Cardinalli said. "While we try to entertain, we also try to present a diversity of artists in keeping with the university's vision."
