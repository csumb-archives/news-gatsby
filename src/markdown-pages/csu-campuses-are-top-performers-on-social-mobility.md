  SEASIDE, Ca., Sept. 11, 2019 -- CSU campuses ranked among the top universities
  for social mobility, according to the

  rankings for 2020. A new addition to the annual rankings, the Top Performers
  on Social Mobility category compares how well universities and colleges do in
  graduating Pell Grant-eligible students.
</p>
<p>
  Among regional western universities, California State University, Monterey Bay
  (CSUMB) ranked third in the

  >
  while San José, Long Beach, Stanislaus, Pomona, San Bernardino, Los Angeles,
  Fullerton, San Francisco, Northridge and Channel Islands dominated the top 20.

<p>
  CSUMB also ranked

    >#8 in top public schools, regional universities west</a
  >, and #26 amongst all private and public regional universities in the West.
</p>
<p>
  The CSU enrolls nearly half a million students each year, and with roughly
  half of them being Pell-eligible and nearly one-third being the first in their
  family to attend college, the university is uniquely positioned to increase
  social mobility on a large scale.
</p>
<p>
  The CSU reinforced its commitment to promoting upward mobility when it
  launched
  <a

    >Graduation Initiative 2025</a
  >, a systemwide effort to improve completion rates for all students while
  eliminating equity gaps between students from underserved communities and
  their peers.
</p>
<p>
  Since the initiative’s launch, the CSU has made great strides toward
  fulfilling its goals, including successfully lowering equity gaps between
  students from traditionally underserved communities and their peers, and
  between Pell Grant-eligible students and their peers.
