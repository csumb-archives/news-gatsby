<p>June 19, 2017 – California State University Chancellor Timothy P. White has issued a statement following the June 15 passage of California's state budget by both houses of the legislature:</p><p>“We are grateful that the budget demonstrates continued support from the governor and legislature for public higher education and recognizes the California State University’s key contributions to the state and our role as an engine of economic and social mobility. The increase in funding is a further step in the right direction and will result in additional students accessing and graduating from the CSU.</p><p>The budget also contains several policy directives for the coming year. We will engage faculty and administrative leadership to determine how we can best move forward to implement these directives that are intended to better serve Californians. Our goal will be to ensure that all students are provided with the courses, the faculty to teach those courses and the wide range of necessary support services that will propel them to graduation and beyond.”</p><p>The California State University will receive a general fund increase of $189.7 million in the 2017-18 state budget. Of that allocation, $177.2 million is recurring funds that can be used for the general operation of the university and for enrollment growth of 2,500 full-time equivalent students across the system. An additional $12.5 million is provided in fixed one-time funding to support the university’s Graduation Initiative 2025 effort.</p>
