<p>
  October 22, 2019 – California State University (CSU) Chancellor Timothy P.
  White today announced his plan to retire in 2020. White has served as CSU
  Chancellor since 2012 and led the university’s restoration and resurgence from
  Great Recession-era cuts to achieve unprecedented heights for student
  enrollment and graduation.
</p>
<p>
  The CSU Board of Trustees will begin a search for White’s replacement
  immediately, with the goal of appointing the next chancellor by the end of the
  current academic year.
</p>
<p>
  “The CSU is deeply woven into the fabric of California, having created
  opportunities for so many people who now play critical roles in our economic,
  social and political life,” said White. “It has been my great honor to work
  with our state’s elected leaders, our Board of Trustees and our campus,
  faculty, staff and student leaders to reinvest in our university to expand
  access and improve academic outcomes for the future.”
</p>
<p>
  When White was appointed, state support in the CSU had declined by nearly $1
  billion. Since that time, the university’s general fund allocation has
  increased from $2.3 billion to $3.6 billion, and White has been instrumental
  in sharing the CSU story throughout the halls of the state capitol to
  reinforce the transformative and life-changing opportunities afforded through
  public higher education. Student enrollment has increased from 436,000 to more
  than 480,000 students. The CSU now confers more than 125,000 degrees each
  year, and graduation rates for both first-time and transfer students are at
  all-time highs.
</p>
<p>
  “Chancellor White has helped guide the CSU through a period of restoration and
  ensured that the state’s renewed investment in the university is repaid by
  creating opportunity for more students and preparing more graduates for
  California’s workforce to help power our economy,” said Adam Day, chairman of
  the CSU Board of Trustees. “The board is grateful for his service and looks
  forward to working closely with Chancellor White in this final year to
  continue our current achievements and build for the future.”
</p>
<p>
  A university-wide focus on improving student achievement has been a hallmark
  of White’s tenure. In 2016, the CSU launched an ambitious initiative to
  increase graduation rates for all students while eliminating opportunity and
  achievement gaps. To accomplish this, the university has addressed several
  areas including academic preparation, enrollment management, student
  engagement and well-being and financial aid and is increasing the use of data
  to inform decision-making while steadfastly removing administrative barriers.

    >Graduation Initiative 2025</a
  >, systemwide graduation and retention rates have reached all-time highs and
  project continued growth.
</p>
<p>
  White has also championed diversity in all areas of the university. In an
  effort to better serve the most diverse group of students in the nation, White
  has led a remarkable change in university leadership. He has led searches for
  21 campus presidents, with women earning 12 of those appointments. Of the
  CSU’s current campus presidents, more than half are women compared to just
  one-third of college and university presidents across the country. The group
  of campus presidents is also ethnically diverse, with African American, Asian
  and Latinx campus leaders. Through White’s commitment to Inclusive Excellence,
  all 23 campuses are working vigorously to create a welcoming environment where
  all members of the CSU’s diverse campus communities can succeed in their
  pursuit of higher education.
</p>
<p>
  In 2015, White commissioned a study of student food and housing insecurity,
  the first such study undertaken at any university. The quantification of the
  depth and breadth of these issues that impede student progress has now led to
  campus programs and state funding to help alleviate these concerns.
</p>
<p>
  Mindful of the university’s role in stewarding the state’s limited financial
  resources, White has also led the university’s efforts to maintain the
  planet’s finite natural resources by spearheading a 23-campus commitment to
  sustainability. Under a university-wide sustainability policy, the CSU has
  integrated sustainability in all facets of the university including academics,
  facilities construction and operation and student life. Despite ambitious
  goals, by 2017 the CSU had already exceeded 2020 targets for reducing
  greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
  A native of Argentina who immigrated with his family to the United States at
  the age of eight, White has been a leading proponent for the federal
  government to take action to find a permanent solution for DACA students and
  employees.
</p>
<p>
  The embodiment of the California Master Plan for Higher Education, White
  attended Diablo Valley Community College, earned a bachelor’s degree from
  Fresno State, a master’s degree from Cal State East Bay (then Cal State
  Hayward) and his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley. He has
  strived to unite all three of California’s higher education systems by
  expanding collaborative efforts with the University of California and the
  California Community Colleges and fostering stronger partnerships with those
  segment’s respective leaders.
</p>
<p>
  CSU Board Chairman Day also announced today that a special committee of
  trustees will be appointed to lead the process to identify the next CSU
  chancellor. The Trustees’ Committee for the Selection of the Chancellor will
  begin by conducting a listening tour in November and December, including
  forums across the state. An Advisory Committee, including leadership from the
  statewide academic senate, California State Student Association, alumni
  council, campus presidents and staff, will also be appointed to serve in
  concert with the Trustees’ Committee. The listening tour will inform the
  qualities and experiences that the CSU’s stakeholders seek in the next
  chancellor, which the committees will use to develop a profile to help guide
  its recruitment.
</p>
<p>
  White will continue in his role as chancellor through June 30, 2020, or soon
  thereafter, depending on the timing of the search process and availability of
  the successful candidate to begin.
