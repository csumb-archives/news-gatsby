  SEASIDE, Calif., September 20, 2018 – ​The California State University (CSU)
  “College Night” came to CSUMB’s University Center on September 19, 2018. The
  free event provided opportunities for local students, parents and educators to
  meet with representatives from each of the CSU’s 23 campuses.
</p>
<p>
  Attendees learned about admissions requirements and eligibility for financial
  aid and outreach staff went over

  >
  deadlines and what types of aid are available. They also learned about several
  other forms of aid offered by the CSU including grants, scholarships and
  work-study programs. Staff also provided guidelines for navigating the CSU’s
  new online application service,

</p>
<p>
  Following the workshops, students and parents had the opportunity to meet with
  representatives to help them decide which university best fits their needs.
  Each campus provides unique tools and opportunities designed to support
  students through their academic journey. Programs like academic advising and
  the first-year experience are being reimagined as part of
  <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/graduation-initiative-2025"
    >Graduation Initiative 2025</a
  >, the CSU’s latest efforts to improve graduation rates and foster student
  success.
</p>
<p>
  “College Night” grew out of the CSU’s Counselors Conference, in which high
  school and community college counselors are invited to hear about the most
  up-to-date information needed to prepare students for the rigors of college
  and create a pathway toward a lifetime of success.
