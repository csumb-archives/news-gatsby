<p>Dear alumni, friends, and family,
</p><p>I often talk about the benefits of connecting to the Alumni Association and participating in one of the many activities on campus. The Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction is always a wonderful event, and I am pleased to say it was very successful again this year. I especially want to thank the members of the board of directors and all the alumni volunteers for their participation on Feb. 26. They, along with university staff and faculty, did an amazing job helping to raise funds for future scholarships.
</p><p>This is your alma mater, and I hope you will join me in making it as successful as possible. Visiting our newly redesigned website, CSUMB.edu/alumni, is a means of staying connected to your fellow alums and the university as a whole. You can also stay engaged and find out about upcoming events by following CSUMB on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or through our monthly e-newsletter.
</p><p>I have made the choice to remain active in our university through the Alumni Association. I hope you will join me by choosing to* continue the vision, give back and stay connected.*
</p><p>Sincerely, April Lee, Business 2007 President, CSUMB Alumni Association 2010-2011
