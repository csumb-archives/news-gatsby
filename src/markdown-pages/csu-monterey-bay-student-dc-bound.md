</p><p><strong><em>Camacho one of just three Californians picked for USDA conference</em></strong>
</p><p>Joey Camacho knows about agriculture from the ground up. Now, he's about to see it from the top down.
</p><p>The CSU Monterey Bay business major, who is concentrating in agribusiness management, is preparing to attend a high-level conference Feb. 18 and 19 outside the nation's capital.
</p><p>Camacho (pictured at left) is getting his chance courtesy of the United States Department of Agriculture. He is among 22 students nationwide – three from California – selected to attend the department's 2010 Agricultural Outlook Forum.
</p><p>As part of the conference's student diversity program, the Agriculture Department and agribusiness sponsors will pay for his airfare, meals, hotel expenses and conference registration fee.
</p><p>The Salinas resident grew up near lettuce fields in the north part of the city. His grandparents worked in the strawberry fields; his brother and sister-in-law work in the produce industry. But agriculture wasn't his first career choice.
</p><p>He was working at HSBC in Salinas but in August 2009 his position was eliminated, forcing him to consider other career paths. Dr. Marylou Shockley, head of the School of Business and one of his professors, suggested he investigate opportunities with the USDA. When Dr. Brad Barbeau passed along information about the forum, he quickly completed the application and required essay.
</p><p>"Joey is one of our outstanding students in the agribusiness program," Dr. Barbeau said. "He's the student coordinator for the agribusiness concentration, helping to create a social network among our agribusiness students."
</p><p>Networking is, at least in part, what the Agricultural Outlook Forum is about. The forum will provide opportunities to learn about the industry, and to do some career networking.
</p><p>"It gives the students some exposure to a wide range of opportunities," said Brenda Chapin, forum coordinator for the USDA.
</p><p>The department bills the annual conference as its biggest event of the year. This year's theme is Sustainable Agriculture: The Key to Health and Prosperity. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will deliver the keynote address. The program includes panel discussions and presentations by experts inside and outside of government.
</p><p>This year's topic fits in nicely with Camacho's interests.
</p><p>"I'm interested in agribusiness because of its importance to environmental sustainability," he said. "I'm attending the conference to learn more about what the USDA is doing to 'go green.' The environment is changing and everyone needs to do their part to help."
</p><p>Camacho, 25, isn't sure what he'll do after he graduates from CSUMB. Law school is a possibility, so is a career with the USDA.
</p><p>The Agricultural Outlook Forum is in its eighth decade, but 2010 marks only the fourth year for the student program. Student selections were based on recommendations and essays on the topic "Agriculture as a Career." The competition was open to juniors and seniors majoring in agricultural-related fields at land-grant and Hispanic-serving institutions.
</p><p>"Some students have told us that this conference was the highlight of their college careers," Chapin said. "They really participate, asking good questions at the presentations.
</p><p>"It's wonderful to see all the energy they bring to the conference."
