<p>
  ​SEASIDE, Calif., Feb. 7, 2019 – By 2023, the California State University's 23
  campuses will be eliminating the use and sale of all single-use plastics
  including plastic straws, water bottles and bags.
</p>
<p>
  A
  <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Documents/5236-00.pdf"
    >new system policy</a
  >
  enacted in December establishes purchasing practices aimed at eliminating
  disposable plastic items—which make up a significant proportion of the waste
  campuses send to landfills—while giving preference to reusable, compostable or
  recyclable products instead.
</p>
<p>
  According to the policy, all CSU campuses must eliminate plastic straws and
  carryout bags beginning in 2019. In addition, campuses must phase out
  Styrofoam food service items by January 2021 and discontinue sales and
  distribution of single-use plastic water bottles before January 2023.
</p>
<p>
  The plan expands upon the
  <a
    href="https://www.calstate.edu/cpdc/sustainability/policies-reports/documents/JointMeeting-CPBG-ED.pdf"
    >Board of Trustees' Policy on Sustainability</a
  >
  by making sustainability central to the CSU's business processes.
</p>
<p>
  "This policy further positions the CSU as a national leader in
  sustainability," said CSU's Executive Director of Strategic Sourcing and Chief
  Procurement Officer Arunkumar Casuba. "Eliminating single-use plastics across
  our 23 campuses will rid our landfills and oceans of thousands of pounds of
  waste—saving marine life and further reducing our carbon footprint."
</p>
<p>
  The momentary utility and convenience of single-use plastics like straws,
  takeout containers and water bottles comes with a big price. These items are
  not biodegradable or take hundreds of years to decompose.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, single-use plastics frequently do not make it to landfills or
  recycling plants. According to Earth Day Network, 32 percent of the 78 million
  tons of plastic packaging produced annually is left to flow into our oceans.
  Much of it ends up in the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" located between Hawaii
  and California, which is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the
  world.
</p>
<p>
  A number of CSU campuses have already eliminated the use of disposable
  plastics. For example, Humboldt State stopped selling water bottles in 2012,
  becoming the first public university in California to do so.
</p>
<p>
  Others are working to meet the goal dates outlined in the policy by preparing
  alternatives including reusable/compostable meal containers, beverage
  containers and straws. Campus procurement, dining and waste management staff
  are also working together to fit the new products in with waste processing
  capabilities.
</p>
<p>
  The new policy aligns the CSU with existing California state laws including

  (food service packaging for state agencies).

<p>
  The CSU is on the cutting edge of discovering and developing new ways to cut
  emissions, increase energy and resource efficiencies, protect wildlife and
  secure the environment for future generations. Learn more about the
