<p>
  For over 30 years, CSU Summer Arts has assembled some of the worldâ€™s best
  creative artists to teach and inspire students across all art genres. Due to
  the impact of COVID-19, CSU Summer Arts was forced to cancel the 2020 season.
  However, to foster creativity and inspire hope, the CSU Summer Arts program
  has established a one-time scholarship opportunity open to any current
  California State University student. All students are encouraged to apply and
  submit an entry regardless of their financial aid status or major.
</p>
<p>
  Two merit scholarships valued at $500 are available. All entries are due June
  5 by midnight. Winners will be announced on June 26.
