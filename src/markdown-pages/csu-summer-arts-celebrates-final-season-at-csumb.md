</p><p>The CSU Summer Arts program was created in 1985 during an arts faculty institute in the woods of the Sierra Nevada, south of Lake Tahoe. CSU faculty and administrators were striving to meet the needs of CSU arts students and supplement the CSU’s extensive and diverse art curriculum.
</p><p>CSU Long Beach hosted the first Summer Arts, beginning as a summer dance program. Summer Arts quickly expanded to include various arts genres and in 1990, the Media Arts Festival. It has been housed at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Humboldt State University, back to CSU Long Beach and then to CSU Fresno before coming to Cal State Monterey Bay in 2011.
