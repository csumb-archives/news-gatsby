<p>. . . Our campus has room for growth; our location makes us a magnet for students. We are close to a variety of ecosystems for our researchers and students to explore, and in the midst of vibrant communities in Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties. â€“ <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Aug. 22, 2012 (op-ed by President Eduardo Ochoa)
