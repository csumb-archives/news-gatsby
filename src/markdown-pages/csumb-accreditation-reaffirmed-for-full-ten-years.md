  SEASIDE, Calif., July 16, 2019 -- The Western Association of Schools and
  Colleges (WASC) Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) has
  reaffirmed California State University, Monterey Bay's (CSUMB) accreditation
  for a full 10 years, which is the longest achievable period of accreditation.
</p>
<p>
  The Commission commended CSUMB in a number of areas, particularly the increase
  in graduation rates since 2011. CSUMB was highlighted in a recent
  <i>Chronicle of Higher Education </i>publication as one of three public
  universities in the U.S. with the greatest improvements in graduation rates.
  The Commission also commended the university on its commitment to the whole
  student, culture of innovation and strong regional stewardship.
</p>
<p>
  “I would like to thank all the many faculty, staff and administrators who made
  this achievement possible through their on-going and lasting commitment to
  reflection and improvement which was visible throughout the Institutional
  Report submitted to WSCUC as part of the reaccreditation effort. I also want
  to thank the many individuals who worked on the reaccreditation process itself
  in all its many forms – committee involvement, writing and review,
  participating in the visit, and a host of other activities. Thank you all for
  your steadfast dedication to this University and to its students,” said
  President Eduardo M. Ochoa.

<p>
  The Accrediting Commission for Schools WASC accreditation assures the
  educational community, the general public, and other organizations and
  agencies that an institution has clearly defined objectives appropriate to
  education, has established conditions under which their achievement can
  reasonably be expected, appears in fact to be accomplishing them
  substantially, is so organized, staffed, and supported that it can be expected
  to continue to do so, and demonstrates that it meets criteria and
  accreditation standards.
