<p>With enrollment in the California State University system expected to top 450,000 for the upcoming school year, hundreds of new faculty members have been hired. At California State University, Monterey Bay, 14 new tenure-track professors have already been hired for the new school year and several more may join them. The university anticipates it will hire 24 more for the 2015-16 school year. The hiring is part of an effort in the CSU system to fill about 700 full-time faculty positions for the upcoming year to accommodate enrollment growth (approximately 10,000 more students are expected this year), relieve course bottlenecks and fill posts left vacant by retiring faculty members. Now that the system is getting more funding – $142.2 million in additional money for the upcoming year – the CSU has made it a priority to boost the number of tenure-track professors, according to CSU spokesman Mike Uhlenkamp.
