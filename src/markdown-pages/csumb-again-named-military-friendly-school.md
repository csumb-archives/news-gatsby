<p>For the fifth consecutive year, CSU Monterey Bay has been named a “military-friendly school” by <a href="http://www.militaryfriendlyschools.com">G.I. Jobs magazine</a>.
</p><p>The list honors the top 20 percent of colleges and universities that are doing the most to embrace America’s military members, veterans and spouses as students and to ensure their success on campus, according to the magazine’s director, Sean Collins. "Inclusion on the list of military friendly schools shows Cal State Monterey Bay's commitment to providing a supportive environment for military students," Collins said.
</p><p>The magazine polled more than 10,000 schools nationwide approved for VA tuition funding in determining the results, examining criteria such as efforts to recruit and retain military and veteran students.
</p><p>Among CSUMB’s military-friendly practices are <a href="http://catalog.csumb.edu/services-activities/campus-services/veterans-services">web pages with information specifically for veterans</a>; a designated veterans services liaison and campus support team to help veterans make the transition from active duty service to successful educational pursuits; and a Student Veterans Organization. CSUMB has seen an increase in the number of queries and applications from veterans since the webpages went up and the veterans' contact was put in place. The number of veterans contacting the university for pre-admission counseling has increased, with queries coming from veterans and active-duty service members across the U.S. and around the world. This semester, 51 military veteran students are using GI Bill education benefits at CSUMB and another 190 students are receiving state or federal education benefits as the dependent of a disabled/deceased service member.
