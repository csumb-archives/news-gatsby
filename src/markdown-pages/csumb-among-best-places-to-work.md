<p>CSU Monterey Bay can claim to be one of the best places to work in the county – for the third time in five years.
</p><p>That’s according to the Monterey County Business Council’s "Best Places to Work" study. The purpose of the program is to provide vital information to local companies about the practices they use to attract and retain talented employees. CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa accepted the award at a luncheon on Aug. 23 at the Beach Resort Monterey.
</p><p>Personal Dynamics Consulting of Florida designed a 40-question survey used to identify the top employers. Turnover rates, spending on employee development, insurance packages and retirement plans were among the 37 measurements used to determine the area's "Best Places to Work." Six employers were honored. In addition to CSUMB, Whitson Engineers, Kennedy Archer and Giffen, Allterra Solar, Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority and the Hyatt Regency Monterey were honored.
</p><p>CSUMB was named a Best Place to Work in 2008 and 2010.
