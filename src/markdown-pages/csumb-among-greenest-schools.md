<p>For the fifth consecutive year, CSU Monterey Bay has been named one of the most environmentally responsible colleges in the country by The Princeton Review.</p><p>CSUMB is featured in the 2015 edition of  “The Princeton Review’s Guide to 353 Green Colleges.” Published April 16, a few days before the annual celebration of Earth Day, the free guide can be <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/green&#45;guide">downloaded</a>.
</p><p>The university is cited for having a “<a href="https://csumb.edu/sustainability">formidable green pedigree</a>.”
</p><p>The guide noted that CSUMB was an early signatory of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, and is working toward its <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/csumb.edu/file/d/0B4wzEOCjqf0cT0pKeS1ZRHB0UUU/edit">goal of being carbon&#45;neutral by 2030</a> through projects such as the six&#45;acre solar installation that is meeting 16 percent of the university’s electricity needs.
</p><p>Also drawing praise was the university’s food service, which includes organic foods, composting of all pre&#45; and post&#45;consumer food waste, using compostable packaging and serving products and recycling cooking oil.
</p><p>In 2013, the guide noted, CSUMB achieved an “astonishing” 79 percent waste&#45;diversion rate, due to the ubiquitous blue recycle bins, an end&#45;of&#45;school&#45;year move&#45;out recycling and donation event and the fact that 90 percent of demolition material from former Army buildings is recycled.
</p><p>Even more impressive, according to the guide, is that 90 percent of campus buildings have undergone energy&#45;related retrofits in the last few years. Custodians use Green Seal Certified cleaning products.
</p><p>The green learning opportunities, which allow students to take courses in subjects as diverse as environmental writing and food ethics, were also cited.
</p><p>The guide pointed out that the commitment to green continues all the way to graduation – when students cross the stage to receive their degrees in gowns sewn with material made from recycled plastic bottles.
</p><p>The guide is based on a survey the company conducted in 2014. It asked administrators at hundreds of colleges about their institution’s sustainability&#45;related policies, practices and programs. Using survey data that covered 25 fields, the guide tallied its “Green Ratings” – scores from 60 to 99– for more than 800 schools. The schools in the guide earned scores of 83 or above.
