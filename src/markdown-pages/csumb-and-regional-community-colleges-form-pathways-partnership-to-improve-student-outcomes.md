<p>
  SEASIDE, Calif., September 26, 2018 – California State University, Monterey
  Bay (CSUMB), Cabrillo College, Hartnell College and Monterey Peninsula College
  have formed the Monterey Bay College Pathways Partnership (MBCPP), a
  partnership aimed at improving time to degree and degree completion rates for
  inter-institutional transfer students in the Monterey Bay region.
</p>
<p>
  Using the Guided Pathways model, a proven model for improving student outcomes
  within individual higher education institutions, the MBCPP seeks to extend the
  concept to inter-institutional transfer students by creating a series of 2+2
  programs (two years of community college coursework plus two years of
  university based upper division coursework). These four year cooperative
  programs are designed to facilitate degree completion and to limit students’
  amount of non-transferable coursework.
</p>
<p>
  The Pathways model includes the concept of meta-majors, clusters of majors
  that are aligned with their stated career or academic interests. By a process
  of gradually increasing degree focus from meta-majors to specific curricular
  disciplines and majors during their first two years of undergraduate
  education, students are far less likely to accrue non-transferable course
  credit.
</p>
<p>
  Intensive academic advising is another aspect of the Pathways model, with the
  intent of assisting students at not only the inception of their college
  experience, but on a consistent basis throughout their academic trajectory.
  Using a combination of digital media based technologies, increased advisor to
  student ratios, and in some cases, mandatory academic advising for first year
  students, the Pathways advising model works in concert with the meta-major
  approach to greatly increase student focus during the first year(s) of
  undergraduate education.
</p>
<p>
  The MBCPP seeks to take the individual institution Pathways model and extend
  the academic advising and academic major coursework integration to an
  inter-institutional model. Having had success with nationally recognized
  programs such as CSin3 and CS++, three and four-year cohort based computer
  science programs developed jointly by CSU Monterey Bay and Hartnell College,
  CSUMB has committed itself to creating a roster of similar degree programs. In
  disciplines ranging from Hospitality to Marine Science, these programs are
  intended to greatly accelerate time to degree and increase degree completion
  for CSUMB transfer students from the Monterey Bay region.
</p>
<p>
  “Regional Stewardship has been a focus of our university during my time at
  CSUMB,” notes Eduardo M. Ochoa, the university’s president. “The MBCPP is
  another step in advancing student success in the Monterey Bay region. By
  working with our partners in the California Community College system, we can
  streamline the transfer process and allow students to shorten the time to
  degree. Shortened time to degree is closely associated with increased degree
  completion, as any student who has faced an extra semester or year of
  coursework to complete their degree knows well. Through the efforts of all
  MBCPP partners, we hope to see dramatic improvements in regional higher
  education outputs within the next decade.”
</p>
<p>
  Increased inter-institutional cooperation is the foundation of the MBCPP, as
  well as a commitment to increasing the numbers of Monterey Bay region
  graduates with the skills and credentials for a digital/knowledge based
  economy. "Strong alliances among higher education institutions in our region
  is important as we improve pathways that lead to educational attainment for
  high-demand, high-wage 21st-century jobs,” stated Willard Lewallen, President
  of Hartnell College. “Improving social mobility is the key to strengthening
  our families and communities."
</p>
<p>
  Extending this cooperation across CSUMB’s entire service area makes the
  inclusion of Santa Cruz County’s Cabrillo College a critical piece of the
  MBCPP equation. "Regional collaboration across our colleges is important for
  our students and our local economy. I am pleased that we are partnering with
  CSU Monterey Bay and our peer institutions to ensure that we have seamless
  pathways for our students to complete bachelor’s degrees that will lead to
  living wage jobs," said Matt Wetstein, Cabrillo College president.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of Monterey Peninsula College, having an academic center
  immediately adjacent to the CSUMB main campus makes the MBCPP a promising
  program. “We serve students best when we collaborate and leverage our talents
  and resources on a regional scale, explained Walt Tribley, MPC’s president.
  ”The synergistic partnership we have will improve outcomes for students beyond
  what we could achieve as individual institutions.”
</p>
<p>
  The number of students transferring to CSUMB from the three California
  Community College members of the MBCPP has increased more than 50% in the last
  five years, a trend that all MBCPP partners expect to continue. “The Pathways
  model is a formula for regional progress and improved academic outcomes for
  our transfer students from the Monterey Bay region,” stated President Ochoa,
  “and we believe that partnerships like the MBCPP are needed to provide
  next-generation opportunities for our graduates, and a next-generation
  workforce to fuel the Monterey Bay economy of the 21st century.”
