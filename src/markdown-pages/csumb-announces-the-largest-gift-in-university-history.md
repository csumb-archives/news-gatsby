<h2>Launches public campaign to reach $100 million.</h2>
<p>
  <b>SEASIDE, CA., May 12, 2020.</b> Longtime Monterey Peninsula resident,
  Robert Darwin, has committed to a legacy gift for student scholarships to
  California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). The largest gift in the
  history of the 25-year-old university, Darwin’s generosity will provide
  necessary scholarships for talented and gifted students from low-income and
  impoverished families with the greatest financial need.
</p>
<p>
  Eduardo M. Ochoa, President of CSUMB, welcomed Darwin’s gift with the
  following remark. “We are extremely grateful for this extraordinary gift from
  Bob Darwin. The bulk of this endowment will provide over $1 million annually
  for student scholarships. It will provide the financial assistance the
  majority of our students require to complete their academic studies, graduate
  and participate in our community as astute global citizens. I have enjoyed
  getting to know Bob personally and consider him a good friend. On a personal
  level, he has an outstanding story of his own having led an extraordinary life
  that is an inspiration to all of us.”

  Darwin, who first came to Monterey in 1945 as an 18-year-old student while in
  the US Navy, graduated from Rutgers University, then began his professional
  career in Hollywood during the early 1950s as a working actor and
  screenwriter, eventually writing and directing his own full length motion
  picture. Weary of the Hollywood lifestyle and anxious to partake in more
  lucrative, mind invigorating endeavors, Darwin formed a real estate
  acquisition partnership during the late 1960s that purchased many highly
  desirable properties throughout the western states, including the Carmel
  Valley ranch where Darwin still resides today.
</p>
<p>
  Darwin’s first housekeeper in Carmel Valley was a delightful young Mexican
  immigrant woman named Ampelia DeLeón, who told Darwin she preferred to be
  called Polly, and she soon proved herself to be very hardworking and
  determined. She also proved to be very cheerful and trustworthy and remained
  in Darwin’s employ for many years. Polly always dreamed of becoming a U.S.
  citizen, getting married, raising a family in the U.S. and sending her
  children through college, and after twenty five years of working for Darwin
  and elsewhere in this county she accomplished those goals; her eldest
  daughter, Blanca Zarazua, is now a successful tax attorney in California and a
  specialist in immigration law. In Darwin’s words, “That’s what I call success.
  Polly achieved exactly what she always strove to do, and if my money can help
  one more immigrant kid earn the same kind of success that Polly achieved for
  her children, then I know I didn’t do it in vain. In essence, Polly’s
  determination became the inspiration for my bequest to the university, and I
  can only thank Polly for her having done so.”

  During his many years on the Monterey Peninsula, Darwin has also raised
  thoroughbred horses, has become a jet-rated, commercially licensed pilot, and
  during the 1980s formed Transjet, the first jet-oriented fixed-base operator
  in the area. Also an accomplished author and photographer, Darwin published a
  highly successful photo book about the Union Pacific Railroad in 1985 and Hard
  on Hollywood, a memoir of his Hollywood years in 2019. He is now in the
  process of completing his second memoir, Fragments, about his non-Hollywood
  years, as well as Yuri, a historically accurate accounting of his father’s
  five-year-long flight out of the Ukraine during the Bolshevik Revolution.

  This gift now positions CSUMB to move from the leadership or “quiet” phase of
  their first comprehensive campaign to a public campaign engaging the broader
  community.
</p>
<p>
  Barbara Zappas, Vice President of University Advancement and CEO of the
  Foundation of CSUMB explains, “We began this campaign in 2015 with the goal to
  complete our campaign in 2020 - the 25th anniversary of our founding. Working
  with our foundation board and campus leaders, we identified our top
  initiatives for student success, academic excellence, program innovation,
  state of the art facilities, and program discretionary funds. The donors we
  have connected with over the past four years have been extraordinarily
  generous and demonstrated their trust in our strategic direction with
  significant philanthropic investments. These gifts have exceeded our
  expectations and have inspired us to reach new horizons. We have raised over
  $95 million dollars and we now hope to achieve a goal of $100 million by the
  end of 2020. Our campaign,
  <a href="https://donate.csumb.edu/vision">Vision 2020</a>, comes as we enter
  uncharted waters in academic learning with the challenges of the global
  pandemic. We believe our community of donors and friends will stand beside us
  as we build CSUMB for the future and continue to show their confidence with
  their philanthropic support. We will all celebrate together in 2021!”
