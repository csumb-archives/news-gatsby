<p>. . . Artist Enid Baxter Ryce lives on what used to be Fort Ord. As a faculty member in CSUMB's Cinematic Arts and Technology Department, she and her husband share a home in repurposed Fort Ord dwellings. She is in perfect position to produce a work of art like "Planet Ord," an ambitious exhibition at the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz. â€“ <em>Monterey Herald</em>, April 3, 2014
