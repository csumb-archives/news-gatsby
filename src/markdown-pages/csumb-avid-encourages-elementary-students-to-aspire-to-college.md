  SEASIDE, Calif., March 6, 2020 - Elementary students from two Monterey
  Peninsula Unified School District (MPUSD) schools — Foothill Elementary and
  Dual Language Institute — visited CSU Monterey Bay in February as part of a
  new program called CSUMB AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination).

<p>
  Activities included attending an Otters Athletics game to experience the
  atmosphere and energy of a college campus. The goal is to encourage and
  motivate the students to pursue higher education.

  CSUMB AVID is a collaboration between CSUMB’s Pre-College Department, Otter
  Athletics and MPUSD. AVID is a national college-readiness nonprofit for
  low-income students. The organization currently serves 2 million students in
  7,000 schools nationwide.

  “It is important to us to prepare students for success in postsecondary as
  early as possible. Though it may look different than middle and high school
  preparation. It still prepares them to get excited about college,” said Kim
  Barber, director of CSUMB’s Pre-College and Early Outreach Support Programs.
  AVID programs normally focus on middle and high schoolers, but the CSUMB
  program is for younger students.

  "When elementary school students and their parents have access to and are
  welcome on a college campus, it enables them to learn to navigate a college
  environment. It builds an early connection between the student and the
  institution and can create a pathway for the student's future college
  attendance,” said Carli Peck, MPUSD’s College and Career Readiness
  coordinator.

<p>
  Experiencing a game day at CSUMB engages elementary students in a fun way and
  promotes a sense of belonging, Otter Athletics Director Kirby Garry said.

<p>
  “Introducing them to our student-athletes allows us to build a stronger
  connection and gives them role models to look up to. The kids can see
  themselves in our student-athletes and continue to aspire to attend college,”
  Garry said.
