<p>CSU Monterey Bay has received one of 24 grants from the U.S Department of Education to recruit, train and support new teachers primarily in science, technology, engineering and math &#40;STEM&#41;.
</p><p>The Teacher Quality Partnership grant totals $8.6 million over five years and will allow the university to work with high&#45;need school districts to strengthen teacher preparation programs, ensuring that teachers have the skills to improve student achievement.
</p><p>CSUMB is partnering with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and 10 school districts in Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties with a total enrollment of 75,000 students.
</p><p>The grant allows for the creation of the Central Coast Partnership for Teaching Excellence. The program will provide new and prospective teachers with skills and knowledge to meet the demands of the Common Core State Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards currently being implemented in California.
</p><p>CSUMB and Cal Poly will work closely to improve teacher credential programs to meet the demands of the new standards; CSUMB plans to add programs that allow students to earn a master’s degree and a teaching credential in 18 months.
</p><p>The grant also provides for $1 million in scholarships to students who agree to teach in a rural school located between CSUMB and Cal Poly.
</p><p>The goal is to build a clear pathway for students as they go from a credential program to their first classroom assignment to continuing education for experienced teachers.
</p><p>“Often, the professional education curriculum of the university does not connect well with professional development and teacher support provided by school districts,” said Dr. Mark O’Shea, a professor of education at CSUMB.
</p><p>“With this funding, we will plan and implement a coherent and developmental curriculum for teacher candidates and classroom teachers" on the Central Coast.
</p><p>This is the second grant from the Department of Education CSUMB has received recently. The university was awarded $14 million to start a GEAR UP program that will work with local students as they progress from middle school through high school and into college.
