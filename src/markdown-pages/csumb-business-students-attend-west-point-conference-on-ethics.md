  Two CSUMB College of Business students participated in the 34th annual
  National Conference on Ethics in America (NCEA) at the United States Military
  Academy (USMA) in West Point, N.Y, in October.
</p>
<p>
  The two-day conference is part of the USMA Cadet Character Education Program,
  and outstanding civilian students from universities across the country are
  invited to attend.
</p>
<p>
  Brandon Baughn, a business administration and marketing major, and Alice Oaks,
  who is studying business administration and accounting, were able to attend
  thanks to the generous support of a sponsor.
</p>
<p>
  This year’s conference theme was “Grit: The Unyielding Determination to
  Prevail.” It aimed to inspire and challenge attendees to overcome obstacles to
  achieve their goals, as well as find innovative solutions for pressing
  problems.

  Keynote speaker Shilo Harris, a retired U.S. Army Cavalry Scout, survived
  devastating injuries after his armored vehicle was struck by an improvised
  explosive device (IED) in Iraq. Other speakers included Karl Meltzer, an
  ultramarathon record holder; Capt. Shaye Haver, the first female Army Ranger;
  and Adrianne Haslet, the Boston Marathon bombing survivor who has won ballroom
  dance competitions and run in two Boston Marathons after losing a leg.
