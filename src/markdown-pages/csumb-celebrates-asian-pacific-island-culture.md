<p>The beauty and diversity of the Asian Pacific Island cultures will be celebrated at Cal State Monterey April 25-29.</p><p>“We create events to educate students about the API culture and traditions we share,” said Matt Menor, president of the campus <a href="http://csumbapia.weebly.com/events.html">Asian Pacific Islander Association</a>. “We would like to showcase our culture to students so they are aware of our traditions and  beliefs, and to make sure that they are educated on who we are,” he said.
</p><p>Here's the schedule:
</p><p><strong>• April 25: Showcase, 6&#45;8 p.m., East Lounge of the Student Center</strong>
</p><p>The week gets under way with an opportunity to learn about CSUMB’s Asian Pacific Islander Association, see arts and crafts from Asian cultures and learn about various Asian countries from campus clubs. The APIA dance team will perform.
</p><p><strong>• April 26: Holi Festival, noon&#45;4 p.m., Main Quad</strong>
</p><p>Holi celebrates spring in the Indian culture. Said Menor: “This is an important event to us because many people have the misconception that Asian counties are only the ones they know – China, Japan, Philippines. Many forget that India is part of Asia.”

</p><p>API faculty members are invited to tell their stories of the traditions they had growing up.
</p><p><strong>• April 28: Luau, 5&#45;8p.m., Dining Commons</strong>
