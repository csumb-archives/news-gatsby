<p>Luis Camara has added another accomplishment to an impressive cinematic career. The longtime CSUMB Cinematic Arts professor wrote a screenplay for a comedy that is now a box office success in Mexico.
</p><p>The film "Me estás matando Susana," &#40;you’re killing me Susana&#41; is based on a novel by the prominent Mexican author José Agustin. It stars Gael Garcia Bernal and Verónica Echegui and opened last week on 600 screens in Mexico, coming in 7th at the box office and earning $620,000. Reviews have been generally positive, with major newspapers such as El Norte, Reforma and Exelsior praising the film and screenplay.
</p><p>In a video review, critics for El Norte called Camara’s screenplay “a solid script” and that the “well executed film” captures “the essence of the Mexican Onda literary movement, while actualizing it to the present day."
</p><p>According to TimeOut Mexico, the film is "a cleverly effective comedy that manages to take only the necessary from the novel to work on screen." Premiere Magazine wrote that the film is "a light comedy that mocks stereotypes in Mexican society, regardless of the character's social status."
</p><p>Originally from Mexico City, Camara is a graduate of the American Film Institute. He has directed the award&#45;winning short films “Endgame” and “Ex Voto,” and the feature films “Steel Trap” and “Silencio,” winner of the best feature award at the Los Angeles Fear and Fantasy Film Festival and best cinematography award at the Queens International Film Festival.
