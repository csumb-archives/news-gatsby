<p>Works by CSU Monterey Bay students,faculty, staff and alumni will be showcased at <a href="www.firstnightmonterey.org">First Night Monterey</a>, the family&#45;friendly celebration of New Year’s Eve.
</p><p>CSUMB Creates! will include music, visual art and film and will be held at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ McGowan Center at Pacific and Franklin streets in downtown Monterey.

The theme for First Night is “art connecting communities.” Many of the CSUMB offerings represent the arts being taught in the Liberal Studies class “The Arts in Schools and Communities,” including the multicultural dance moves led by staff member LaTanya Wilson.

Music performances include alumni in the African drumming group Tam Tam Sacre, and guitarists led by Music and Performing Art student Timothy Patchin with youth from Guitars not Guns playing American standards.

The Visual Art exhibit features a project “Posts for Peace and Justice” that CSUMB students participated in with local elementary schools. From 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., First Night revelers can participate in hands&#45;on art activities at the McGowan Center.

A collection of animated short films produced by students in the university’s Cinematic Arts and Technology Department will also be shown.

New Year’s Eve performers aren’t the only CSUMB community members involved with First Night. <a href="https://csumb.edu/news/students&#45;artwork&#45;promotes&#45;first&#45;night&#45;monterey">Carly Allen designed the art that goes into the buttons, posters and on the web to promote the annual festival.</a>
