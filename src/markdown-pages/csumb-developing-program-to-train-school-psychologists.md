<p>FEDERAL GRANT PROVIDES FUNDING</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay has received $1.2 million from the U.S. Department of Education to develop a program to train school psychologists.
</p><p>This program will meet the state and national chronic, critical shortage of school psychologists, who support K&#45;12 students in a variety of ways.
</p><p>The school&#45;age population of the Central Coast includes large numbers of English language learners and students from migrant backgrounds. With that in mind, the new program will ensure that the school psychologists trained at CSUMB will have specific expertise in supporting those students.

Students in CSUMB’s new credential program will work in partnership with the university’s school social work program, also in development. They will be cross&#45;trained to work within the context of culture, specifically with Hispanic and Latino families. CSUMB will partner with more than 100 area schools that have been identified as high&#45;poverty and with a majority of English learners.T​he hope is that the experience of working in those schools will encourage credential students to stay in the area and serve local schools.
</p><p>When students complete the three&#45;year program, they will have earned a master’s degree in education; a Pupil Personnel Services: School Psychology credential; and a certificate in Behavior Analysis.
</p><p>The program is in development and will be offered once all appropriate approvals are secured. The first two classes will consist of 30 students; 24 of them will receive scholarship funding. The program has funding for five years.
