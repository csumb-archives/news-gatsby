<p>Cal State Monterey Bay’s Service Learning program has earned another honor.
</p><p>The university was recently named to the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for 2014. It is the highest federal honor universities can receive for their commitment to service learning and civic engagement.
</p><p>The Corporation for National and Community Service launched the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll in 2006 to recognize institutions of higher learning that support innovative and effective community service and service&#45;learning programs. Since the program’s inception, CSUMB has been recognized each year; it is the most decorated service learning program in the country.
</p><p>For 2014, CSUMB was recognized on the President’s Honor Roll with distinction for leadership in general community service and economic opportunity. It was also honored in the category of education.
</p><p>At CSUMB, issues of service, diversity, social justice and social responsibility are linked to the core curriculum.
</p><p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of a few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all students. Each year, nearly half of CSUMB students enroll in service learning courses, contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non&#45;profit organizations and government agencies in the tri&#45;county area.
</p><p>According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors, including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent to which service&#45;learning is embedded in the curriculum, the school’s commitment to long&#45;term campus&#45;community partnerships, and measurable community outcomes as a result of the service.
