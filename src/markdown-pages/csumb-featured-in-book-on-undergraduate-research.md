<p>Whether at a field site or in a lab, the chance to conduct research is a game-changer when it comes to earning a degree. Staff members of CSU Monterey Bay’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center – or UROC – believe that passionately, and work to offer all students that chance.
</p><p>Research, they say, can ignite a passion, build and reinforce confidence and keep students on track for graduation and success beyond commencement – in graduate school or the workplace.
</p><p>UROC was established in 2009, and since then it has earned a national reputation for excellence, achievement and leadership.
</p><p>As a result, Dr. Bill Head, UROC director, and Jessica Brown, assistant director, were invited to submit a chapter for the just published book, “Undergraduate Research Offices and Programs: Models and Practices,” published by the Council on Undergraduate Research.
</p><p>The book features programs from a range of institutions – large research universities to community colleges. UROC was asked to contribute a chapter from the perspective of a primarily undergraduate institution.
</p><p>“Writing the chapter and later comparing UROC to other offices featured in the book were exhilarating,” Dr. Head said. “We were particularly struck by how unique and comprehensive UROC is.”
</p><p>UROC works across all academic disciplines, which, as the book points out, only a few schools do. And students receive a wide range of support – from seminars on graduate school and fellowship applications to coaching on how to present their work in public settings.
</p><p>“Writing the chapter enabled us to think deeply about our short but robust history, our values and approaches, our benchmarks and where are going,” Dr. Head said.
