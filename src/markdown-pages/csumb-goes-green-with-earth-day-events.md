<h3>Mammoth comes back from extinction – at least for awhile</h3><p>Education is at the heart of Earth Day – which is really Earth <em>Week</em> at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The university will celebrate with eight days of activities intended to educate the community about the planet, sustainability and how we can make the world a better place.
</p><p>Earth Day was first observed on April 22, 1970, when 20 million Americans took to the streets, parks and classrooms across the country to demonstrate for a healthy environment and a sustainable way of life. That led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the clean air, clean water and endangered species acts. It was the birth of the modern environmental movement.
</p><p>Since that first Earth Day, people around the world have sought to celebrate the planet. But Earth Day is about more than observing the beauty and vitality of nature; it's also about renewing our commitment to saving our living planet. ??
</p><p>Associated Students Environmental Senator Tyler Belko wanted to add something new to this year’s celebration, and came up with the idea of a 3D art piece that would raise awareness of the environment, Earth Day and public art.
</p><p>He approached Dio Mendoza, an instructor in the Visual and Public Art Department, about a project that would involve the entire campus. Originally, he wanted an earth globe sculpture, but Mendoza and Steev White, VPA instructional technician, suggested a mammoth – a creature that has been extinct for thousands of years – as a symbol of climate change. 
</p><p>Over the course of several months, the 6-foot-tall sculpture was created in the VPA studio using plastic, fabric, Styrofoam and paper. On April 12, it was moved to a location outside the library, where it will be on display until commencement. <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/apr/17/mona-mammoth">Read more about Mona the Mammoth</a>.
