<p>&#42;<strong>Annual event at CSUMB raises money for student scholarships</strong>&#42;
</p><p>KSBW&#45;TV meteorologist Jim Vanderzwaan will help auction off dozens of items – including tickets to the Panetta Lecture Series and next year's AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro&#45;Am – at the 12th annual Have a Heart for Students dinner and auction at California State University, Monterey Bay on March 13.
</p><p>Thegoal is to raise $110,000 for student scholarships, a need that is more urgent than ever because of the financial crunch many families are experiencing.
</p><p>Dozens of faculty and staff volunteers take on the roles of waiters and wine stewards, all in an effort to raise money to help the 65 percent of CSUMB students who receive some form of financial aid.
</p><p>This year's planning committee is co&#45;chaired by Leslie Taylor and Shahin Anable. "Efforts like this are really community events," Anable said. "They're about our future – wherever we live."
</p><p>The theme is "Home, Sweet Home" and features a menu inspired by the Salinas Valley and the Monterey Bay. Live and silent auctions will highlight the event, which will be held in the University Center ballroom and begin with the silent auction and mixer at 5 p.m. Dinner will start at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $85 per person and can be reserved by calling 582&#45;4141. <a href="https://csumb.edu/site/x11523.xml">For more event information, click here.</a> For driving directions and a campus map, visit csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>Faculty, staff and alumni volunteers are also needed to help with the serving. To volunteer, call Christina Bailey at 582&#45;3017.

The committee is working on a behind&#45;the&#45;scenes tour of the Hollywood set for the TV series "CSI." <strong>WHAT:</strong> Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction<strong>WHEN:</strong> 5 p.m., Saturday, March 13<strong>WHERE:</strong> University Center on Sixth Avenue, CSUMB campus<strong>COST:</strong> $85 per person.
