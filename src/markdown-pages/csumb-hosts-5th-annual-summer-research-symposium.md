  Postgraduate School Internship Program (NPS) that includes students from
  Hartnell College and Monterey Peninsula College.

  “It's [the research symposium] particularly important to them to be able to
  connect with this academic community as well as be recognized by our campus
  and regional leadership,” said UROC Associate Director, Holly Unruh. “This
  year's address from Congressman Jimmy Panetta really made an impact for them.”
</p>
<p>
  The symposium included 10-minute scientific-style talks by the REU and UROC
  undergraduate students in the morning and poster presentations by the UROC,
  NPS, Hartnell and Monterey Community College undergraduate students in the
  afternoon giving the student researchers a chance to showcase their work.
</p>
<p>
  “Most importantly, we are creating equitable opportunities for students from
  throughout our region to engage in the process of inquiry, to tackle
  real-world problems - many of them particular to our area - and propose their
  own innovative solutions,” said Unruh.
</p>
<p>
  Hosting open community events is in keeping with CSUMB’s role as a community
  resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought
  and action on issues important to our community.
