  The student-researchers who presented at the symposium came from across the
  nation to conduct research, both locally and nationally, across multiple
  disciplines. Research topics ranged from atmospheric sciences, marine biology,
  physics, meteorology, agriculture, social sciences, educational research,
  cyber security, kinesiology, psychology, mathematics, conservation science,
  and more.

<p>
  The summer research symposium served as a culminating event highlighting the
  research and learning over the past ten weeks while providing a forum for
  students, faculty, community partners and guests to engage in lively
  discussion regarding research, innovation and education happening in our
  community.
</p>
<p>
  “This symposium gives students a chance to showcase the scholarly activities
  they have been conducting over the summer. For many of them, it’s a chance to
  create a culminating product highlighting their learning over the past 8-10
  weeks; it’s an invaluable experience that helps them prepare for graduate
  studies and beyond. These types of experiences often lead to further
  engagement and career opportunities for students, with all sorts of positive
  implications for regional economic growth," said Banks.
</p>
<p>
  Hosting open community events is in keeping with CSUMB’s role as a community
  resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought
  and action on issues important to our community.
