</p><p>&#42;<strong>Nationally honored program gets under way July 6</strong>&#42;
</p><p>Starting July 6, more than 250 youngsters will spend a month on the campus of CSU Monterey Bay as the Migrant Junior Otter program gets under way for its second year.
</p><p>The program offers instruction in language arts and math in the morning. Each afternoon, students will be involved in theater activities, including music, dance, art and video editing. The youngsters will also be introduced to college life and learn what it takes to be a successful student.
</p><p>They will stage a performance for their families and school district officials at a closing event on July 30.
</p><p>A collaboration among CSUMB, the Monterey County Office of Education and El Teatro Campesino – the San Juan Bautista theater group founded by Luis Valdez – the program will involve youngsters in grades four through eight from 10 Monterey County school districts.
</p><p>"We are very proud of the Migrant Junior Otters Program," said Rosa Coronado, MCOE migrant education director. "In May, it was recognized at the 2010 National Migrant Education Conference as an outstanding example of a collaborative effort.
</p><p>"We are confident that 250 young migrant students will be excited and inspired about their future holding the prospect of attending a college or university," Coronado said.
