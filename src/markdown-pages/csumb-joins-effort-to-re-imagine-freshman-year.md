<p>SCHOOLS WILL TEST PROGRAMS FOR HELPING STUDENTS SUCCEED</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay is one of 44 colleges nationwide selected for a pilot program coordinated by the Association of American State Colleges and Universities &#40;AASCU&#41;.
</p><p>The three&#45;year program, Re&#45;imagining the First Year of College &#40;RFY&#41;, aims to transform the freshman year in order to improve students’ chances of success in school and in the 21st century workplace. It is funded through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USA Funds.
</p><p>“We are honored to be involved in such a prestigious and worthwhile project,” said CSUMB Provost Bonnie Irwin. “The Re&#45;imagining the First Year of College project will allow CSUMB to continue to work on student success on campus and it will align nicely with Monterey County's cradle&#45;to&#45;career partnership, Bright Futures.”
</p><p>The first year of college is a critical barrier to student success, the point at which schools experience the greatest loss of students. The goal of the RFY is to help the 44 participating colleges implement changes that enhance the first&#45;year experience, increase retention and improve graduation rates, particularly among historically underserved populations – low income, first generation and students of color.
</p><p>AASCU has put together a list of what it calls “the most promising practices” based on tested strategies from across the country. Each campus has to commit to at least one strategy at four levels: institutional, curriculum, faculty/staff, and students.
</p><p>CSUMB will also participate in a learning community with the other colleges and universities selected for the RFY.
</p><p>By the end of three years, the goal is for each campus to have a better strategy for student success with measurable results on things such as retention and credits earned, plus a broader support network. AASCU will have a repository of best practices to share with the higher education community.
</p><p>“Our graduation rates are rising,” Dr. Irwin said, “but with this extra effort and the collaboration of our colleagues across the country, we will be able to provide even better support for students. The CSUMB project team is passionate about this work and excited to get started.”
