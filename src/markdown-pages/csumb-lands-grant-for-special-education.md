<p>Cal State Monterey Bay’s teacher education program has received a federal grant to help students obtain a special education credential. Over the course of four years, the U.S. Department of Education grant will provide $1.1 million to provide scholarships for people who want to prepare for a career teaching students with disabilities in the Monterey Bay area. The grant will provide scholarships that can be used to cover tuition, fees, textbooks and laptop computers for credential candidates. Grant money will also be used to develop computer technology that will allow students to access course content online, and use video conferencing for field supervision. Candidates will complete the program equipped to teach students with moderate to severe disabilities including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance. Credential candidates will gain field experiences in the tri-county region as well as in high-need schools. “This grant will address the critical shortage of credentialed special educators in the local area,” said Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor in the special education program.
</p><p>“It’s an opportunity for currently employed teachers who lack a credential to earn one. It’s also an excellent opportunity for those with a general education credential who are out of work due to the budget situation to go into special ed,” Dr. Harrower said.
</p><p>The grant will support a total of 40 students and is renewable for as long as a student needs to complete his/her credential. The program is designed to be completed in two years.
</p><p>The first group of students will start in summer and fall 2011. Prospective students must apply to the university and the special education program, then they can complete an application for funding.
