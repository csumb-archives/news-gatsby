<p><strong><em>President Harrison joins nine CSUMB students and staff who were recognized Feb. 20 for their outreach and tutoring service at Greater Victory Temple in Seaside.</em></strong>
</p><p>Parishioners at three local churches got more than a sermon on Feb. 20. They got a pitch for the value of a college education — straight from the pulpit.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison, Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe and Vice President for Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs visited churches in Seaside and Pacific Grove as part of a California State University program called Super Sunday.
</p><p>Administrators across the CSU system fanned out to more than 100 black churches to spread the gospel of higher education and encourage more African-Americans to attend college.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison reminded the congregation at Greater Victory Temple in Seaside that CSUMB “is your hometown university.”
</p><p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe visited Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Seaside, and Dr. Higgs spoke at the First Baptist Church of Pacific Grove.
