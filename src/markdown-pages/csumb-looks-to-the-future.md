<p>The Speakers Bureau provides speakers at no cost to service clubs, schools, senior centers, and other groups in the local area.</p><p>Booking a speaker is easy. Just e-mail your request to the CSUMB Public Information Officer.</p><p>CSUMB faculty and staff members are currently offering talks on the following topics:</p><h4>Research at CSUMB: Why we do it and what it means for the Monterey Bay region</h4><p>Researchers at the university bring in millions of dollars in grants. Those funds create jobs and support the development of new knowledge. We’re eager to discuss economic development and to share ideas for cooperation and collaboration between the university and industry.
</p><p>Presented by a university administrator.
</p><h4>From ‘You’ve got to be kidding!’ to ‘Ah-ha!’ – hope for our oceans through insight and innovation</h4><p>The talk discusses innovative ways to address the unprecedented threats of climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification, pollution, fishery declines, coastal erosion, algal blooms and storm intensification on the coastal oceans and communities.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><h4>Peeling back the blue: how we map and use 3D visualization to reveal and learn from Earth’s hidden seafloor landscapes</h4><p>Although the global ocean is the driver of weather, a highway for marine commerce, a reservoir of vast marine resources, and our playground, we know more about distant planets than we do about the seafloor. Imagine if the next time you were standing at the ocean's edge that instead of watching crashing waves, you were able to visualize submarine canyons, underwater seamounts and ridges, and even a kelp forest teeming with marine life. The State of California has undertaken a cutting&#45;edge project to make this possible by mapping the seafloor of all the state's waters. Dr. Kvitek will show you the first images created from this effort and share with you how this new information is already being used in a multitude of ways.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><h4>Science with a mission at CSUMB</h4><p>The CSUMB Science Division includes experts from both terrestrial and marine realms. Their common mission is to use sound science to solve environmental problems in the tri&#45;county area. They use cutting&#45;edge technology and student power for the good of the community.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>San Clemente Dam removal</h4><p>San Clemente Dam will be removed from the Carmel River to reduce the risk of dam failure and to foster the historic salmon run. This large&#45;scale project will have long&#45;term impacts on the watershed, and could be a model for other dam removal projects in California.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>Water resources on the Monterey Peninsula</h4><p>People on the coast between Carmel and Seaside have been seeking a sustainable water resource for decades. The search has been fraught with technical, political and legal pitfalls. What are the technical solutions? What are the political/legal constraints? What's the latest plan?
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>The geology of coastal Monterey county: resource opportunities and geological hazards</h4><p>Wherever you stand, there is a stack of rocks below your feet that records the local geological history and governs the kind of urban development that is suited to the region. We will consider the water resources and environmental hazards of our region. Water is scarce, and urban expansion is locally constrained by coastal erosion, landslides and hill slope erosion potential.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>Institute For Applied Marine Ecology (IFAME)</h4><p>The primary goal of the IfAME is to provide science in support of government decision&#45;making ranging from local municipalities to state, federal and international governments. That science includes monitoring the new state marine protected areas along California's coast, exploring the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries from Monterey to New England, studying the impact of commercial bottom trawling on seafloor habitats around the world, and diving from the world's only undersea laboratory in the Florida Keys. The closely linked secondary goal is to involve CSUMB students in the conduct of this research.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. James Lindholm
</p><h4>Math, revealed – Cracking the mysteries of math for youngsters</h4><p>New research examining thousands of students in two dozen California school districts finds that students already doing well in math in the seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math courses in high school and meet college entrance requirements. But for many students who struggle with math in grade seven, there is no clear path to learning and achievement. CSUMB math professor Hongde Hu uses math games, engaging presentations and curriculum he has been refining for years to reach those youngsters.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Hongde Hu
</p><h4>Innovation in higher education</h4><p>Higher education is facing challenges in an era of increased demand, changing demographics and declining state support. American colleges and universities will need to adopt new educational approaches and technologies to serve more students while maintaining quality. CSUMB is addressing this through a variety of ways: a new three&#45;year computer science degree developed in partnership with Hartnell College; creation of an Institute for Innovation and Economic Development; and exploring the potential to use technology for online programs.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Eric Tao
</p><h4>Eyewitness memory</h4><p>Eyewitnesses are notoriously bad in the identification of the perpetrator of a crime. If you witness a crime, can you be sure that your memory for that event is accurate? Not really. Scientific evidence explains that memory changes over time, is malleable and is easy to manipulate via suggestibility and misattribution. Find out why eyewitnesses are so bad at remembering details of the crime and in the identification of the perpetrator.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>Creating memories for events that never happened</h4><p>False memories are the remembering of events that never took place. Memory is easily manipulated and can change without our awareness. Memory research shows that it is easy to create false memories &#40;for example, a memory of getting lost in the mall&#41;. One of the issues with false memory is that you cannot tell the difference between a false memory and a real one.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>They all look the same: the other-race effect</h4><p>The other&#45;race effect is a deficit in the ability to recognize or identify a face that is of a different race. You might hear a child say, “All of the faces look the same,” which is common response when looking at faces of an unfamiliar or different race. I examine what influences the other&#45;race effect and what helps to minimize this effect.
</p><p>Presented by  Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>A vision for service: At CSUMB, giving back is a core value</h4><p>CSUMB has won national acclaim for integrating community service with each student’s academic experience, and is changing lives – and our ideas about learning and community – in the process
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Seth Pollack
</p><h4>Mexican entrepreneurs: a new look to immigration</h4><p>Immigrants aren’t always who you think they are.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Juan Gutierrez
</p><h4>Creating customer loyalty</h4><p>John Avella, head of CSUMB’s hospitality program, has 40 years of human resource development and teaching experience in the hospitality industry. He has been vice president of human resources for Marriott Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the World, and president of Human Resource Concepts. His work focused on management and executive development, Customer service and organizational strategic change. He has studied the application of emotional intelligence to customer service/loyalty, emotional labor and leadership. He has developed a process that teaches people to “connect” to the customer.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>The region’s hospitality industry – what’s ahead?</h4><p>The lingering effects of the recession and looming water problems are just two issues facing the local tourism/hospitality industry. What’s on the horizon?
</p><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>Sustainable hospitality management</h4><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>Kinesiology gains in popularity</h4><p>Kinesiology – the study of human movement – is the fastest&#45;growing major on campus. As the U.S. population skews older – and fatter – there’s a demand for fitness trainers, physical therapists and researchers who study the science of movement and performance. Dr. Kent Adams, a prolific researcher as well as head of the kinesiology department, shares his findings to help people keep fit across the lifespan.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Kent Adams
</p><h4>Nursing program will meet a need</h4><p>The health care industry is coping with the “silver tsunami” of aging baby boomers, combined with the impact of health care reform. Nurses will play a big role in meeting both challenges, but will need more than a two&#45;year degree to do so. CSUMB has partnered with four community colleges in the region to offer a four&#45;year degree that prepares them to serve as health care navigators, helping patients manage multiple conditions such as hypertension and diabetes outside a hospital setting.
</p><p>Presented by Marianne Hultgren
</p><h4>Unraveling standardized testing and evaluation</h4><p>Mark O’Shea, a professor education at CSUMB, has been studying the standards movement from the perspective of the classroom teacher for years. He has conducted extensive clinical research in standards&#45;based education and has consulted with school districts and state departments of education. He can also talk about the new Common Core standards – he helped state officials develop the science standards – and their implementation in California.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Mark O’Shea
</p><h4>Digging through time</h4><p>Dr. Ruben Mendoza is an archaeologist, writer, and photographer who has explored the length and breadth of Mexico, Central America, Europe, and the U.S. Southwest documenting both pre&#45;Columbian and Colonial era sites and collections. He has directed major archaeological investigations and conservation projects at missions San Juan Bautista, Carmel, and Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, among others. Recent efforts at the Royal Presidio of Monterey resulted in the tandem discovery of the earliest Serra era Christian houses of worship in California dated to 1770 and 1771. And he has made astronomically and liturgically significant discoveries of solstice, equinox, and feast day solar illuminations of mission church altars throughout California, the U.S. Southwest, and Mesoamerica.

</p><h4>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute is bringing seniors back to school</h4><p>Are you sitting on an idea for the next great American novel and don't know how to begin? Would you like to understand contemporary art? Ever wonder where our special brand of weather comes from? Would you like to know the history of Cannery Row? Then the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute &#40;OLLI@CSUMB&#41; is the place for you. These are just some of the topics that have been covered in courses that range from one day to eight weeks during the Fall and Spring semesters each year. For adults age 50 or better and funded in part by the Bernard Osher Foundation, many of our courses are taught by CSUMB professors. There are no test and no grades, just good fun and great fellowship with friends and neighbors in our region. Learn how and why OLLI@CSUMB came into being and how it has evolved to reflect the interests of our adult learners.
</p><p>Presented by Michele Crompton
</p><h4>Summer arts</h4><p>Sword fights, improvisational comedy, animation, painting: Summer school was never this much fun. Several hundred students – high school, college, and adult members of the local community – come to the university in July for the annual CSU Summer Arts program. The longtime CSU program relocated to CSUMB in the summer of 2012 for a five&#45;year run. The program includes a couple of dozen public events, including lectures, readings, concerts and theatrical productions – in other words, the area’s summer arts scene has gotten a lot more interesting.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Ilene Feinman
</p><h4>CSUMB goes green</h4><p>People across campus are working on many fronts to make Cal State Monterey Bay a more sustainable university. We developed a Climate Action Plan that will provide a road map for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and Issues surrounding sustainability are addressed in many classes. We've also have a robust alternative transportation program in place. Mike Lerch, CSUMB's Manager of Energy and Utilities, can speak to the many energy efficiency upgrades on campus &#40;that have cut our energy use 20% and reduced our carbon footprint.
</p><p>Presented by Mike Lerch, CSUMB’s associate director of facilities services and operations
</p><h4>Art in the service of science</h4><p>Science illustration is all around us – in books, magazines, posters, on websites, in films and TV, and in museums. Most of us don’t notice the extraordinary technical skill, the precision and carefully observed detail, or the beauty of these illustrations because we’re busy absorbing information from them. CSUMB is home to a nationally renowned science illustration program; graduates’ work is in the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History; in top science magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, Nature and Audubon; at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

More news and events, campus pics, and social chatter among students and university folk.</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay has an active and engaged faculty, staff and student body, and we love interactive ways to connect and share information online. The university encourages its faculty, staff and students to use tools such as social media to advance their work and heighten their experience as members of the campus community.
</p><p>In an effort to give direction when using social media, University Communications has developed the following guidelines. These guidelines are not intended for Internet activities that do not associate or identify a faculty or staff member with CSUMB, do not use CSUMB email addresses, do not discuss CSUMB and are purely about personal matters.
</p><h2>What is social media?</h2><p>We consider social media any technology tool or online space for integrating and sharing user&#45;generated content in order to engage in conversations. These guidelines do not attempt to name every current and emerging platform, but some examples are Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Instagram.
</p><h3>If you post/manage a social media account on behalf of Cal State Monterey Bay:</h3><p><strong>Be connected.</strong> If you have been authorized by your supervisor to create a CSUMB social media site or a video for posting in locations such as YouTube, please contact University Communications for an approved logo and other images and to ensure coordination with other CSUMB sites and content. Social media channels are not considered official unless they are developed or authorized by University Communications, which maintains and publicizes a list of all official university social media channels.
</p><p>As the administrator of a CSUMB social media channel, you accept the responsibility for maintaining current and accurate content and monitoring and moderating posts to that channel, including deleting comments and posts that do not meet the criteria set forth in these guidelines.
</p><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> As a CSUMB employee or representative, you should be mindful of the university’s public mission as a forum for thoughtful discussion of opposing ideas. Some online communities can be volatile, tempting users to behave in ways they otherwise wouldn’t. Your reputation, and CSUMB's, are best served when you remain above the fray.
</p><p><strong>Be responsive.</strong> If a question or comment is directed toward you via your social media site or page, you should do your best to reply in a timely and appropriate fashion. If the comment is a complaint or critique, follow these tips to resolve the situation: <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/7&#45;tips&#45;for&#45;dealing&#45;with&#45;upset&#45;facebook&#45;fans/">http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/7&#45;tips&#45;for&#45;dealing&#45;with&#45;upset&#45;faceboo...</a>
</p><p><strong>Be transparent.</strong> If you participate in or maintain a social media site on behalf of the university, clearly state your role and goals. Discuss with your supervisor when you are empowered to respond directly to users and when you may need approval.
</p><p><strong>Be thoughtful.</strong> Before you jump into a discussion thread or respond to a posting, think about the implications. Will your response stimulate positive discussion, provide new information or insight, or inflame? If you have any questions about whether it’s appropriate to enter into a social media discussion or write about certain kinds of material in your role as a CSUMB employee, ask your supervisor before you post or contact University Communications.
</p><p><strong>Know the rules.</strong> Comply with FERPA, the CSUMB honor code and policies related to Conflict of Interest, Privacy, Security, Safety, Intellectual Property, Computing and Technology Resources, and Human Resources. Become familiar with the terms of service and policies of sites and networks in which you participate. Pay attention to updates. If the legal language is hard to follow, follow a respected blogger or two who discuss service changes in their posts.
</p><p>You are responsible for gaining the expressed consent of all involved parties for the right to distribution or publication of recordings, photos, images, video, text, slideshow presentations, artwork and advertisements whether those rights are purchased or obtained without compensation.
</p><p><strong>Keep your personal views separate</strong>. Uphold the university’s mission and values in your activities. Don’t include political or personal comments. This includes changes to your photo or avatar in relation to political or social issues. Do not use CSUMB's name to promote or endorse any product, cause, or political party or candidate.
</p><h3>Personal site guidelines</h3><p><strong>Be authentic</strong>. Be honest about your identity. In personal posts, you may identify yourself as a CSUMB faculty or staff member, but please be clear that you are sharing your personal views, not representing CSUMB. This parallels media relations practices at CSUMB.
</p><p>A common practice among individuals who write about the industry in which they work is to include a disclaimer on their site, usually on their “About Me” page. If you discuss higher education on your own social media site, we suggest you include a sentence similar to this: “The views expressed on this &#91;blog, Web site&#93; are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of CSUMB.”
</p><p><strong>Don’t be a mole.</strong> Never pretend to be someone else and post about CSUMB. Tracking tools enable supposedly anonymous posts to be traced back to their authors. There have been several high&#45;profile and embarrassing cases of company executives anonymously posting about their own organizations.
</p><p><strong>Take the high ground.</strong> If you identify your affiliation with CSUMB in your comments, readers will associate you with the university, even with the disclaimer that your views are your own. Remember that you’re most likely to build a high&#45;quality following if you discuss ideas and situations civilly.
</p><p><strong>Be aware of liability.</strong> You are legally liable for what you post on your own site and on the sites of others. Follow the same CSUMB honor code, FERPA, Conflict of Interest Policy, Privacy and general civil behavior guidelines cited above including respecting copyrights and disclosures, and not revealing proprietary financial, intellectual property or similar sensitive or private content. Individual bloggers have been held liable for commentary deemed to be proprietary, copyrighted, defamatory, libelous or obscene &#40;as defined by the courts&#41;.
</p><p><strong>Remember that all content contributed on all platforms becomes immediately searchable and can be immediately shared.</strong> This content leaves the contributing individual faculty/staff/students members’ control forever. Employers are increasingly conducting Web searches on job candidates before extending offers. Be sure that what you post today will not come back to haunt you.
</p><p><strong>Follow a code of ethics.</strong> There are numerous codes of ethics for bloggers and other active participants in social media, all of which will help you participate responsibly in online communities. If you have your own social media site, you may wish to post your own code of ethics or adapt an existing code already on the Web. Monitor comments. Most people who maintain social media sites welcome comments; it builds credibility and community. However, you can set your site so that you can review and approve comments before they appear. This allows you to respond to comments in a timely way. It also allows you to delete spam comments and to block any individuals who repeatedly post offensive or frivolous comments.
</p><p><strong>Share and link back.</strong> Please share content posted on official CSUMB social media channels across your personal networks, and link back from your site to CSUMB.EDU. By virtue of self identifying as part of CSUMB in such a network, faculty/staff/students connect themselves to, and reflect upon, the university.

</p><p>Tony Boles has joined California State University, Monterey Bay as associate vice president of Campus Development and Operations.
</p><p>He will oversee campus master planning and building space management, all campus design and construction services, environmental protection and facilities maintenance.
</p><p>" I see coming to the CSU MB as a great opportunity to be part of the growth and development of a new and exciting campus in one of the most beautiful places in the world," Mr. Boles said.
</p><p>He brings 25 years experience in all phases of architectural design work, planning and construction project development for a wide range of private- and public-sector facilities. He comes from Gafcon Construction and Project Management, where he managed the development of a $1.1 billion, 1,700-acre park project in Irvine.
</p><p>Earlier, he was senior deputy director/county architect for the County of San Diego, where he managed the capital improvement and master planning programs. He also served as associate director and construction administrator at San Diego State University, where he oversaw more than $50 million in campus improvement projects.
</p><p>Mr. Boles served in the U. S. Navy's Civil Engineer Corps, where he directed major construction projects throughout the world. He completed his Navy career as the base closure manager for the Marine Corps air stations in El Toro and Tustin.
</p><p>He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture from Cal Poly Pomona and also earned a master's degree in city and regional planning from San Diego State University. He is a registered architect in California.
</p><p>Mr. Boles joined the university on Oct. 18. He replaces Niraj Dangoria, who left CSUMB earlier this year to become assistant dean, facilities planning and management, at Stanford University.
</p><p>Location, location, location.
</p><p>The real estate agents’ mantra may also explain the next undergraduate major to be added to the curriculum at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>It is location that attracted Elyssa Farmer, a freshman from Pacifica.
</p><p>“As a 10-year-old, I fell in love with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and wanted to become a marine biologist just like the ones at the aquarium,” she said. When it came time to choose a college, she decided on CSUMB because “it’s located next to one of the richest marine regions in the world. Because of that, I figured it would be sensible to study it here.”
</p><p>As faculty member Bill Head, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, points out, “When you think of Monterey Bay, you think of marine science.
</p><p>“We have a more concentrated number of marine science institutions here than anywhere in the country.”
</p><p>Marine science has been part of the curriculum almost since the beginning of the university, offered as a concentration called “marine and coastal ecology” within the Environmental Science, Technology and Policy degree program. Courses have been added over the years, including a scientific diving program that was introduced last spring. It filled up in a day-and-a-half.
</p><h5>A new degree is born</h5><p>As soon as the approval process is completed, that concentration – which has by far the largest enrollment of the five available in the ESTP major – will be renamed “marine science” and elevated to a separate program, leading to a bachelor of science degree.
</p><p>Elevating the popular program to degree status meets student demand for a degree with a more recognizable name and serves to make the program more visible and attractive to prospective students.
</p><p>“Our job is to present students with a suite of opportunities,” said Dr. James Lindholm, the Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine Science and Policy. “It’s the Field of Dreams approach – create it and they will come.”
</p><p>And it meets the needs of employers.
</p><p>“Employer surveys show a demand for graduates who can address real-world, interdisciplinary problems and have good technical skills,” said Dr. Marsha Moroh, dean of the College of Science.
</p><p>An important part of the program is the hands-on experience students get with advanced technologies for collecting, analyzing and communicating scientific data.
</p><h5>Hands-on experience</h5><p>Students get that hands-on experience in the laboratory and through fieldwork, often working alongside professors on real-world research projects. Teaching and mentoring are at the heart of the experience.
</p><p>“We give students training in geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and seafloor mapping,” Dr. Lindholm said.
</p><p>A prolific researcher, he involves students – undergraduates as well as graduate students in the Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy program – in much of his work.
</p><p>Since joining the faculty at CSUMB in 2007, Dr. Lindholm has established the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology. The goal of the institute is to understand the interaction of marine ecological systems and human activities.
</p><p>Among the institute’s many projects is one surveying deep-water habitats in the newly created marine protected areas along California’s north central coast ­– from San Mateo County north to Mendocino County, using a remotely operated vehicle. The information gathered will serve as the foundation of a program to evaluate the status of fish, invertebrates and their seafloor habitats inside and outside the new MPAs.
</p><p>Another project involves collecting video and photos that help to explore, describe and catalogue the resources of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
</p><p>He’s also researching the recovery of seafloor habitats off Morro Bay and the Gulf of Maine following the cessation of trawling.
</p><h5>Ten days in an undersea laboratory</h5><p>Perhaps the project with the highest visibility is Dr. Lindholm’s work with Aquarius, the world’s only underwater laboratory.
</p><p>In 2008, he led a mission that studied the movement and behavior of coral reef fish off Key Largo in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Dr. Lindholm supported the mission from the surface, but three CSUMB graduate students spent 10 days in the lab, 60 feet below the sea surface.
</p><p>He returned in October to lead Aquarius 2010: If Reefs Could Talk, a mission designed to educate the public so they can make informed decisions about how their actions impact the world’s most important resource – the ocean.
</p><p>Dr. Lindholm and a graduate student lived in the laboratory, which he says is similar to the International Space Station in size and functionality. Two students worked from the surface, and two more were “ambassadors” for the program, working with Monterey County schools that showed live broadcasts from the lab.
</p><p>Qualifying for the mission isn't easy. The physical requirements are similar to what potential astronauts face. All participants have to be experienced divers with research and rescue certifications.
</p><p>"This is truly a remarkable opportunity for these students," Dr. Lindholm said. "What they are going to experience is extraordinary."
</p><h5>Students work on seafloor mapping</h5><p>Other opportunities – and jobs – are available to students through the university’s Seafloor Mapping Lab.
</p><p>Supported through grant and contract work, the Seafloor Mapping Lab conducts marine habitat survey work from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The lab has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California's state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles.
</p><p>The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>“We know more about the surface of Mars than the three-mile strip of state waters along our coast,” Dr. Kvitek said. “If the goal is to protect and sustainably manage our marine resources, we don’t have the tools to do it without that basic map. You can see everything down to the size of a lawn chair, and you can look for changes year after year.”
</p><p>Dr. Kvitek’s work has been featured on the Discovery Channel and in National Geographic magazine, among other publications.
</p><p>These opportunities to do hands-on research appeal to students.
</p><p>“I chose CSUMB because the fieldwork with the marine program is a big part of it, and I like working outside, with people,” said Jazmyn Julius, a freshman from Santa Maria.
</p><p>Katie Wrubel can tell Jazmyn about that.
</p><p>Wrubel, a 2010 graduate of the ESTP program, spent the summer working with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The 10-week program was identified by CSUMB’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center and sponsored by Oregon State University.
</p><p>She’s now pursuing a Ph.D. in environmental science at Washington State University in Vancouver.
</p><p>“The people I met are the best part,” Wrubel told OSU. “The marine science world is so small and it seems that everyone knows everyone, so joining that circle has opened so many doors for me.”
</p><p>AT A GLANCE
</p><p>Currently, more than half of the 300 Environmental Science, Technology and Policy majors at Cal State Monterey  Bay and about 30 percent of the 400 biology majors are pursuing marine-related concentrations.
</p><p>No other school in the 23-campus California State University system offers a B.S. in marine science. Pending approval, the degree is scheduled to be offered at CSUMB in the fall of 2012.
</p><p>Marine scientists deal with a variety of issues ­– from climate change, declining fisheries and eroding coastlines to the invention of new technologies to explore the sea.
</p><p>According to NOAA, there’s a huge potential for growth in the field as researchers learn more about the ocean and its interactions with the land and atmosphere, how humans affect the ocean, and the impact of ocean resources on our quality of life.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison urged faculty and staff of Cal State Monterey Bay to answer a call to service and excellence for the university and its students in her annual State of the University address in August.
</p><p>“… In spite of the still-sluggish economy and the unresolved state budget, I have never been so proud of our entire university or felt more confident of its continued progress,” she said.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison pointed out the positive response the university has received from the organization reviewing its application for re-accreditation. “California State University, Monterey Bay has turned an important corner from its formative years and is maturing as a comprehensive university for the 21st century,” she said.
</p><p>More than 1,100 new students – freshmen and transfers – attended campus orientation sessions during the summer. But Dr. Harrison reminded her audience that more than 3,200 qualified applicants had to be turned away because of a budget-imposed cap on enrollment.
</p><p>The new students, she pointed out, “come with high expectations, and they are counting on us to help them achieve their goals – regardless of the state budget.”
</p><p>Money will continue to be tight for years to come, she said. “A scarcity of public dollars has become the new normal.”
</p><p>But Dr. Harrison quickly moved beyond money to talk about a few of the university's recent accomplishments.
</p><p>The biology, psychology, kinesiology, business, math and computer science majors have clearly resonated with students. And so does the new Master of Social Work program, which started its first class with approximately 40 students.
</p><p>“We will not be stymied by state budgets or be satisfied to simply ride out the storm,” Dr. Harrison said. “Together we will continue to innovate and be leaders in our disciplines and services and in higher education.”
</p><p>The number of CSUMB students from the tri-county area increased in Fall 2010. Residents of Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties now make up 33 percent of enrollment, compared with 31 percent last year. Northern California and Southern California each supply approximately another third of students.
</p><p>Total enrollment is 4,790 this semester, including 829 freshmen and 490 new transfer students. This year’s incoming class has a grade-point average of 3.25, up slightly from last year.  
</p><p>Marina Mayor Bruce Delgado presented a ceremonial key to the city to President Dianne Harrison as part of Otter Fest 2010, the city’s welcome-back event for students held Aug. 29, the first Sunday of the fall semester.
</p><p>Prior to the event, Delgado told the City Council, Marina “wants them, loves them and needs them,” referring to students and the potential boon they represent to the city. Otter Fest included extended hours at the weekly farmers market, food, cooking and gardening demonstrations, live music from a trio of bands, and a business promotion with “Otter Fest passports” and prizes designed to get students into many of the city’s businesses.  
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay is one of the most racially diverse schools in its category, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report in the 2011 edition of America’s Best Colleges.
</p><p>CSUMB is tied with Amherst College at No. 11 on the magazine’s “diversity index” among national liberal arts colleges – schools that award at least half their degrees in the fields of liberal arts. Approximately 265 colleges and universities are in the category. The “diversity index” factors in the total proportion of minority students and the overall mix of groups. The information is drawn from each school’s 2009-10 student body.
</p><p>CSUMB also was a leader in the U.S. News category of least debt owed by students. Members of the class of 2009 who borrowed money had an average debt of $15,254.
</p><p>Washington Monthly magazine rated CSUMB highly, as well.
</p><p>The university ranked second among the nation’s public liberal arts colleges in its contribution to the public good, according to the magazine’s 2010 College Guide.
</p><p>The Washington Monthly rates schools based on: recruitment and graduation of low-income students; cutting-edge scholarship and Ph.D.s; and students who give back to their communities.  
</p><p>For the third straight year, CSUMB has received a grant from the outdoor recreation retailer REI for the university’s Return of the Natives project.
</p><p>The $15,000 grant will support work with school children and local teachers, university students and community volunteers on habitat-restoration projects on Fort Ord public lands, the creeks of Salinas and Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District lands in Locke-Paddon Park and Marina Dunes Preserve.
</p><p>Return of the Natives is dedicated to bringing people closer to nature and nature closer to people through hands-on experience in restoring habitats. The REI grant is one of many received by CSUMB, totaling $18.2 million in 2009-10.  
</p><p>In an effort to maximize the education students receive outside the classroom, CSUMB now offers residents the opportunity to live in “themed” learning communities.
</p><p>Students can choose to live on residence hall floors set aside for those interested in science and math, outdoor adventure, liberal studies or business. While no academic content is tied to the living arrangement, leisure-time activities are scheduled around the topics.
</p><p>Freshmen also have the option of participating in Project Higher Ground, where they live in residence halls with a group of students who take at least two courses together.  
</p><p>Filmmaker Magazine has honored CSUMB alumni Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck.
</p><p>The magazine, a quarterly publication and website devoted to independent film, named the pair to its annual list of “25 New Faces.”
</p><p>The list is the magazine's “bet on the individuals who will be shaping the independent film world of the future.”
</p><p>When Machoian (Class of '07) and Ojeda-Beck ('09) met as students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, they had different styles but found a third when working together.
</p><p>The films they have made together display classic art house film style, according to the magazine. Visuals are the key, along with colorful imagery and solitary characters in simple situations, with editing that tells a story without much dialogue.
</p><p>At CSUMB, their goal was to make as many films as they could over the course of a semester, resulting in 14 shorts. “Ella and the Astronaut” was shown at festivals all over the world, and “Charlie and the Rabbit” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last January.
</p><p>Machoian has become the first TAT alumnus to get a university teaching job. He has a full-time position this semester at Cal State Sacramento, replacing a faculty member who is on leave. Ojeda-Beck is enrolled in the Master of Fine Arts program at UC Berkeley with a fellowship to help cover the cost.
</p><p>Dance is at center stage for the World Theater’s 10th anniversary season.
</p><p>The Paul Taylor Dance Company returns Nov. 11. Taylor has choreographed a new dance called “Brief Encounters,” in celebration of his 80th birthday. The piece is set to the music of Claude Debussy’s “Children’s Corner.”
</p><p>On Oct. 21, Madrid-based Noche Flamenca made its first visit to campus, presenting the Spanish folk art form of rapid, fluid guitar playing, heart-piercing vocals and impassioned dancing.
</p><p>The fall schedule will close Dec. 11 with a Hawaiian family holiday performance featuring slack key guitarist George Kahumoku. Known as Hawaii’s Renaissance man, Kahumoku is an accomplished musician as well as a sculptor, painter, teacher, farmer and captivating storyteller.
</p><p>All performances start at 7:30 p.m. For ticket information, visit the theater online at <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu/">CSUMB.EDU/worldtheater</a> or call 831-582-4580.

</p><p>After a career in the Army, and a second one spent in the mining industry in Peru, Dick Guthrie of Pebble Beach was looking for ways to satisfy his curiosity about, well, almost everything.
</p><p>He heard about the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute from someone he knew and discovered that for a $149 annual fee, he could participate in a variety of programs for a single price.
</p><p>Guthrie signed up, and is now in his second year.
</p><p>“I have a wide range of interests, and OLLI satisfies them,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for everyone in the area.” This year, he’s taking writing classes and one in archaeology.
</p><p><strong>TO GET INVOLVED:</strong> An annual OLLI membership fee of $149 covers up to six classes. Become a member by going online at <a href="http://csumb.edu/olli">CSUMB.EDU/olli</a>. The site has course and enrollment information. Membership includes a university parking pass and discounts to the World Theater and athletic events, as well as use of athletic facilities. Students may also choose to pay a per&#45;class fee. To register by mail, call the OLLI office at 831&#45;582&#45;5500
</p><p>Guthrie is one of several hundred people participating in OLLI, which was established at Cal State Monterey Bay four years ago with funding from the Bernard Osher Foundation of San Francisco. The 80&#45;year&#45;old Osher is a champion of lifelong learning who backs up that passion with donations of hundreds of millions of dollars. His generosity has funded 119 OLLI programs around the country.
</p><p>The program is intended for people over 50. Classes focus on personal enrichment and come in a variety of formats: Some are lectures, others are discussions; still others are hands&#45;on. The courses require no tests, research papers or grades.
</p><p>Most classes are held on campus, though a few are held at other community locations. Topics this semester include gospel choir; modern spiritual masters and integral philosophy, both taught by John Provost; weather and hurricanes; a cultural history of jazz; autumn bird migration; and the California elections, taught by former State Assemblyman Fred Keeley.
</p><p>Guthrie and nine others turned out on a Thursday morning in September to resume the OLLI Writers’ Circle. All of them are continuing students. They range from beginning writers to published professionals. They’re working on all kinds of projects and all receive constructive feedback on their work. Guthrie is writing a memoir about his experience as a company commander in Vietnam. And he’s serious about it.
</p><p>“I won’t rest until I’ve told about the soldiers’ bravery and sacrifice under trying conditions,” he said. “The OLLI writing courses have helped me stay focused and productive.”
</p><p>If he can’t secure a traditional publisher, he intends to self&#45;publish the book.
</p><p>Kathy Whilden of Monterey, a retired social worker, has been in the Writers Circle since it formed.
</p><p>“I always thought of myself as a writer – I loved that part of my job. I’m reporting on my life now; I reported on other people’s lives then,” she said.
</p><p>“Writing about my life is a way to give it validation.”
</p><p>Andrea Gilliland, a psychology major and certified pastry chef, works for Sodexo in the Catering Department and the Otter Bay Cafe.
</p><p>During last year’s Otter Orientation, she inquired about a gluten-free meal for her mother. This inquiry, along with her culinary experience, landed her a chef position for Sodexo while she continues as a full-time student. Gilliland has since introduced gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian and vegan options for diners.
</p><p>“Working in the Catering Department has provided me with challenges and also the ability to branch out in my creativity,” said the senior from San Luis Obispo. She also created menu items for the Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction, the Business Showcase Dinner, and this year’s post-Commencement luncheon.
</p><p>After graduation in spring 2011, she plans to cook her way through school as she completes a Master of Social Work degree.
</p><p>Austin Long, a senior in the Visual and Public Art Department, already has the sensitivity and worldliness of a great photographer. The son of an artist and a military officer, he spent half of his high school career in Bolivia, where he soaked up the culture and dabbled in photography.
</p><p>But what was once a hobby is now his career focus. Last year, Long received recognition for his talents as a photographer, winning the first Roy De Carva/Carrie Mae Weems Photo Prize, a $1,000 scholarship awarded by CSUMB’s VPA program to outstanding student photographers.
</p><p>“I’m more at home in the VPA program,” he said. “The program’s strength is teaching us how to think like artists, how to conceptualize our work, not just produce it.”
</p><p>Long needed a compelling portfolio to receive the award, and he had one.
</p><p>Two summers ago, while on a trip with his grandfather to the Dominican Republic, he documented daily life.
</p><p>Cupping a 1987 Model Nikon N4004 camera in his hand and shooting with Velvia slide film, Long traversed the cities of Jaibon and Santo Domingo. The simple moments of children playing jump rope, elderly men relaxing in the afternoon, and teenagers chatting under a tree caught his eye.
</p><p>Long plans to be a commercial photographer when he graduates this spring while continuing to pursue his art.
</p><p>“Everyone here actually has an art career, on top of teaching,” he said. “It is cool to be able to talk to people who are working artists.”  
</p><p>For the first time since its inception in 1985, CSU Summer Arts will reside at CSU Monterey Bay, bringing an artistic explosion to Monterey County. On July 2, the first of Summer Arts' five-year residency at CSUMB began. – <em>California State University website,</em> July 2, 2012
</p><h3>CSUMB librarian part of group performing in London</h3><p>Cal State Monterey Bay didn’t land an athlete at the Olympics, but the university will be represented in another way.
</p><p>Reference and instruction librarian Sarah Dahlen is a member of the Monterey Peninsula Choral Society. The 113-member group will perform at several venues in London during the Games, one of just six choirs in the world invited to sing during the 17-day run of the Olympics.
</p><p>“The choir typically has rehearsals once a week, but for the weeks leading up to our departure, we’ve had four each week,” Dahlen said. “And I’ve done a lot of work on my own as well, and am usually singing in the car.”
</p><p>The choir is scheduled to perform at Olympic Park, where as many as 30,000 people are expected to be in the audience. The singers will also perform at Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and several other venues.
</p><p>“Our repertoire includes about 25 songs and I’ve pretty much got all of them memorized at this point,” she said.
</p><p>The society will present a bon voyage concert July 27 at a church in Carmel; Dahlen will leave for Paris the next morning.
</p><p>“We’re skipping the craziness of the Opening Ceremonies to sing at a couple of venues in Paris: La Madeleine Church and EuroDisney,” Dahlen said.
</p><p>The group, which also includes retired CSUMB staff member Diane Ehlers, will take a ferry to the United Kingdom on Aug. 1, in time to do some sightseeing before their concerts.
</p><p>“I’ve never been to the Olympics before, but I think it’s an amazing event and it will be great to be around the energy of the athletes and spectators in the park, even if we’re not able to attend a competition” Dahlen said.
</p><p>The organizers were not able to secure tickets for the large group, but “they made up for it by getting us tickets to see Wicked in London’s West End.”
</p><p>Most members of the group will return home on Aug. 6, but Dahlen will head to Finland for a couple of weeks. She’ll attend a meeting of the International Federation of Library Associations, where she’s scheduled to present a workshop on using rubrics for information literacy instruction. And then she’s headed to Kuusamo, 37 miles south of the Arctic Circle, for a week of vacation.
</p><p>“I’m hoping to do some hiking there and enjoy the long daylight hours,” she said.

</p><h3>An insider’s look at Seattle’s outsider poet</h3><p>The Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay will present a screening of “I Am Secretly an Important Man” at the Osio Theater in Monterey on March 5.
</p><p>The documentary film, directed by Peter Sillen, will be shown at 7 p.m.
</p><p>In the film, Sillen examines the life of subculture hero Steven Jesse Bernstein. Bernstein, a songwriter, poet and performance artist, was a literary rebel and vivid presence in Seattle’s underground scene in the 1970s and ’80s. Cited as the “godfather of grunge,” he opened concerts for Nirvana and Soundgarden and recorded albums of songs and poetry for Sub Pop Records.
</p><p>The film’s title comes from one of his poems, “Come Out Tonight.” It became an inspiration and an anthem for the grunge-rock movement.
</p><p>Using video and audio clips of his subject, along with interviews with the artist’s family, friends and colleagues, and powerful footage of the darker side of Seattle, Sillen shows the poet’s self-examination and what Bernstein called just plain “doing your job.”
</p><p>The director will be on hand to introduce the film and to take questions from the audience after the showing. A New York based documentary filmmaker, Sillen is best known for his low-tech approach and sensitivity to his subjects and their environment. He has screened his films at a wide array of festivals and venues including the Sundance Film Festival, Berlin Film Festival, South By Southwest, Slamdance, the Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Academy of Music and San Francisco’s Castro Theater.
</p><p>Mike Plante, an associate programmer of the Sundance Film Festival who has worked with TAT for several years, selected the film.
</p><p>According to TAT department chair Enid Blader, “Mike selected it not only because it fits with the literary tradition of the Monterey Bay area, but also to continue championing films that might otherwise go unseen, and to support a filmmaker who is telling a story in a distinct and stylish way.”
</p><p>Tickets can be purchased at the door at the regular Osio prices: $9 for general admission, $6.25 for seniors, $6.75 for students/military with ID.

</p><h3>Campus will participate in systemwide workshop</h3><p>Whether at a field site or in a lab, the chance to conduct research is a game&#45;changer for many CSU Monterey Bay students when it comes to earning a degree.
</p><p>The experiences, they say, can ignite a passion, build and reinforce confidence, keep them on track for graduation and provide a head start on graduate school.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the challenge of pursuing a hypothesis down a rigorous line of research is infused throughout the curriculum. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center – UROC – builds on the curriculum to engage students in research beyond the classroom.
</p><p>UROC is a cross&#45;campus center that serves students in multiple disciplines. These experiences help students make the link between their classroom and the wider world and help them to develop critical skills for success in graduate school and professional life.
</p><p>Now, campuses in the CSU are coming together to do some serious thinking about undergraduate research across the 23&#45;campus system. Because of its leadership in this area, CSUMB has been selected to participate in a workshop next October designed to improve and expand the opportunities for students. Eight other campuses will also participate. The emphasis will be on the STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – fields.
</p><p>The workshop will emphasize connecting current undergraduate research activities across campuses, developing databases to track students’ progress, building undergraduate research into faculty workload and identifying a curriculum model that would provide every undergraduate access to research opportunities.
</p><p>UROC began in January 2009. Since then, nearly 200 students have been served; currently, 60 students are engaged in or pursuing research placements.
</p><p>“We know the power of undergraduate research here at CSUMB,” said Dr. Bill Head, UROC director and professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy. “We’re proud of the commitment and leadership our campus has shown at providing these opportunities for our students.
</p><p>“We look forward to collaborating with our partner campuses to expand these opportunities throughout the CSU educational experience.”

</p><h3>UCLA’s Cheryl Keyes visits CSUMB </h3><p>Dr. Cheryl Keyes, professor of ethnomusicology in the School of Music at UCLA, will lecture on the development of rap/hip-hop music when she visits CSU Monterey Bay on Dec. 6.
</p><p>The free lecture will be held from 10 to 11:50 a.m. in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue and Butler Street.
</p><p>Dr. Keyes is the author of “Rap Music and Street Consciousness,” which received a CHOICE award for outstanding academic books when it was published in 2004.
</p><p>This professor speaks the language of the streets; she also speaks on panels and at seminars as a nationally recognized rap/hip-hop scholar whose academic credentials include a Ph.D. from Indiana University.
</p><p>While “rap” defines the music, Dr. Keyes told the Long Beach Press-Telegram, hip-hop embodies a larger “youth art movement,” composed of music, graffiti, attitude and dress. Her work draws on research she has done in West Africa, New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles and London.
</p><p>Rap music, according to Dr. Keyes, is a forum that addresses the political and economic disenfranchisement of black youths and other groups, fosters ethnic pride, and displays cultural values and aesthetics. Blending popular culture with folklore and ethnomusicology, she offers a nuanced portrait of the artists, themes, and various styles reflective of urban life and street consciousness. A filmmaker, she has completed a documentary called “Beyond Central Avenue: Contemporary Female Jazz Instrumentalists of Los Angeles,” funded by UCLA’s Center for Community Partnerships. Her musical creative works have been performed by the Women’s Jazz Orchestra of Los Angeles. As a performer, she played with trumpeter Clark Terry’s All-Girl All-Star Jazz Band, and she has recorded with New Orleans rhythm-blues pianist Eddie Bo, and with jazz clarinetist Alvin Batiste. Her debut CD, Let Me Take You There, won an Image Award from the NAACP in the category of Outstanding World Music Album.” Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>. While the lecture is free, visitors must buy a parking permit from machines located on the adjacent lot.

</p><p>Imagine if, over a decade, San Francisco Bay lost enough sediment to fill about 5,000 Olympic swimming pools with sand and gravel, and some mud.
</p><p>That's appears to be what happened.
</p><p>According to research just published by CSU Monterey Bay professor Rikk Kvitek (pictured at right) and U.S. Geological Survey researcher Patrick L. Barnard, an analysis of bathymetric (or sea-bottom) measurements taken in 1997 and again in 2008 indicates that the west-central San Francisco Bay – roughly from the Golden Gate to about a mile east of Angel Island and Alcatraz – lost about 14.1 million cubic meters of sediment. That's the equivalent of about a square mile piled about 17 feet high – or those 5,000 pools.
</p><p>The report appears in the current issue of San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science. Access it here.
</p><p>The 2008 analysis, they wrote, benefited from advances in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that virtually eliminated inaccuracies due to changing tides or rocking vessels; and from recent improvements in multi-beam sonar, seafloor sampling and underwater video that more clearly reveal the depth and nature of sediments above bedrock.
</p><p>"The seafloor position can now be mapped with unprecedented detail and precision," the researchers wrote.
</p><p>Their mapping covered about 15.6 square miles, about one-fourth of which was under lease for aggregate mining. The leased areas, they found, lost sediment at more than four times the rate of the non-leased areas. (Overall, based on soundings taken from 1947 to 1979, San Francisco Bay appears to be losing sediment three times faster than it did in the mid- to late-20th century.)
</p><p>Kvitek and Barnard conclude that the recently lost, predominantly coarse, sediment was "material that would otherwise have been available for transport to eroding, open-coast beaches" along the San Francisco shoreline.

</p><h3>CSUMB Rotaract Club organizes March 29 event</h3><p>The CSU Monterey Bay Rotaract Club will host a Zumbathon to benefit the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life from 10 a.m. to noon, Saturday, March 29 at Water City Skate in Marina.
</p><p>Relay for Life is more than just a fundraiser. It’s a time to “celebrate, remember and fight back” against cancer. CSUMB Rotaract, a campus organization dedicated to community service and affiliated with Rotary International, is doing just that with this upbeat, high-energy event.
</p><p>According to club co-president Charn Singh, a junior biology major, Rotaract brings together college students for the purpose of humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting peace around the world. Said Singh: “One thing that makes our club unique is that we’re not university-based; instead, we’re community-based. Students from Monterey Peninsula College, Hartnell College, Monterey Institute of International Studies and the Defense Language Institute can join, and we have several members from each of those institutions.”
</p><p>Zumbathon participants are asked to make a $10 minimum donation. All proceeds will go to the American Cancer Society. Raffles, prizes and giveaways from local restaurants and businesses will be part of the fun.
</p><p>Relay for Life is a life-changing event that gives everyone a chance to celebrate the lives of those who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost and fight back against the disease.
</p><p>“Everyone knows someone touched by cancer, which in itself is really scary. It’s important for our community to come together and help finish the fight against cancer,” Singh said.
</p><p>“Sometimes, it’s easy to feel small when you want to do something major. As long as we have passionate individuals who want to help in any way, then I know we can make a difference. It’s all about ‘Service Above Self’.”
</p><p>Participants should bring water, a towel and a smile to this event. To find out more about the Zumbathon, contact Carina at <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x63;&#97;&#x6e;&#x64;&#114;&#x61;d&#101;&#x40;&#99;&#115;&#x75;&#109;&#x62;&#x2e;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">candrade@csumb.edu</a>.

</p><p>. . . CSU Monterey Bay is ranked fourth among the nation's public liberal arts colleges in its contribution to the public good. The university is also ranked third overall in research expenditures, according to the Washington Monthly 2011 College Guide published this week. – <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Sept. 3, 2011
</p><p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has once again honored CSU Monterey Bay for its focus on service and public engagement, making it one of only 361 institutions in the United States to hold the classification.
</p><p>The 2015 Community Engagement Classification documents CSUMB’s “excellent alignment among campus mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices that support dynamic and noteworthy community engagement,” according to the foundation. Community engagement, as defined by the foundation, focuses on the collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources. “We appreciate this recognition by the Carnegie Foundation,” said CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa.
</p><p>“Community engagement has been a cornerstone of CSUMB since our founding and its importance has only grown over the years. We want to continue to build on our tradition of service learning and to seek new and meaningful ways to build partnerships that help move our community forward,” the president said.
</p><p>In 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed the first <a href="http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu">classification system</a> for American colleges and universities as a research tool to describe and represent the diversity of U.S. higher education. The Community Engagement category was first created in 2006, and the designation was awarded to CSUMB that year. It is one indication of the growing importance of community service and civic engagement as a priority for higher education.  <strong>About the university’s community engagement initiatives</strong> ?CSUMB's community engagement initiatives are diverse and originate from every academic program, emblematic of CSUMB's commitment to active learning and its concern for its role as a "steward of the region."
</p><p>CSUMB is one of the few universities in the nation – public or private – to have made <a href="http://service.csumb.edu">service learning</a> a graduation requirement for all students. Through service learning, all CSUMB academic departments and programs have been able to develop strong relationships throughout the community.
</p><p>Nearly half of CSUMB students enroll in service learning courses each year, contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non&#45;profit organizations and government agencies in the region. A few examples of the university’s outstanding accomplishments in service learning and community engagement include:
</p><p>• CSUMB's <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/programs/chinatown&#45;renewal&#45;project">Chinatown Renewal Project</a>, which involves over 100 students each year in the revitalization of Chinatown neighborhood in Salinas;
</p><p>• <a href="http://ron.csumb.edu">Return of the Natives</a> environmental restoration project, which works with over 60 students in various environmental efforts;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://seafloor.otterlabs.org">Seafloor Mapping Project</a>, which develops detailed maps for state agencies;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Courses/MissionArchaeology/introduction.htm">Mission Conservation Program</a>, which involves dozens of students in conservation and interpretation projects at the region's historic missions;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/aug/1/mastering&#45;math">Algebra Academy</a> and <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/jun/25/high&#45;school&#45;students&#45;imagine&#45;college">Imagine College</a>, which work directly with local youth in college preparation courses. The university was honored with another community engagement award in December – the 2014 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, awarded by the Corporation for National and Community Service. CSUMB is the only two&#45;time recipient of the prestigious President’s Award for Community Service in Higher Education.
</p><h3>‘Steinbeck: The Art of Fiction’ includes sculpture by VPA grad</h3><p>Work by alumnus Lew Aytes will be on display at the American Tin Cannery through March 31. The exhibit, “Steinbeck: The Art of Fiction,” features artistic interpretations of John Steinbeck’s work in sculpture, photography and painting.
</p><p>Aytes’ pieces are three&#45;dimensional faces that represent his visions of Steinbeck’s characters.
</p><p>Works by photographer Robert Nease and painter Warren Chang are included in the exhibit, along with the Robert Lewis exhibit of Cannery Row photographs from 1957&#45;58.
</p><p>The exhibit was created for the National Steinbeck Center by Aytes and Nease, and displayed there last year. The current exhibit has been expanded to include Chang’s paintings of fieldworkers and Lewis’ historic images of Cannery Row.
</p><p>Aytes earned a bachelor’s degree from Sacramento State, where he studied music performance and conducting, and an MBA in finance from California Southern University. A re&#45;entry student at CSUMB, he earned a degree in Visual and Public Art in 2012.
</p><p>On his <a href="http://www.lewaytes.com">website</a>, he says: “In one form or another, art has existed in my life as long as I have memory. My first conscious production of art was musical . . . Music also transported me into the medium of sculpture later in life.”
</p><p>The exhibit is on display on the second floor of the American Tin Cannery, 125 Ocean View Blvd., Pacific Grove. The building is located around the corner from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. &#42;Photos Top: John Steinbeck sculpture by Lew Aytes Above: Aytes hanging his work at last year's exhibit at the National Steinbeck Center&#42;

</p><p>For the fifth consecutive year, Cal State Monterey Bay has been named a "military-friendly school" by G.I. Jobs magazine. –* The Salinas Californian*, Sept. 16, 2013
</p><p>The community is invited to a screening of Godfrey Reggio’s prophetic 1982 film, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> at 4 p.m., Oct. 1, in the TAT studio. The director will make a presentation and then screen the film. <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> – “life out of balance” in the Hopi language – is a visual tone poem with no dialogue and no conventional plot, which the director describes as a reversal of the typical saying that “a picture is worth a thousand words,” and is instead “a thousand images to convey the power of one word.” The film presents a stunning montage of images from urban traffic to desert vistas to electronic circuits, accompanied by a score from Philip Glass to explore the threats posed to nature by modern civilization. One critic called it a “unique, contemplative film.”
</p><p>Said Walter Ryce in the Monterey County Weekly: "It is a wordless work that said much about the world then (1982), and the world we live in now."  The showing and talk kicks off the Philip Glass Center for the Arts, Science and the Environment's annual Days and Nights Festival at Big Sur's Henry Miller Library and Carmel's Sunset Center. <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2013/sep/25/faculty-filmmakers-featured-days-and-nights-festival"><em>Faculty filmmakers' work screened at Days and Nights Festival</em></a>
</p><p>A seven-year stint in the U.S. Coast Guard offered Bridget Hoover many exciting experiences. It was also a time when she saw the water quality of the ocean at its worst.
</p><p>After responding to many oil spills off the Eastern Seaboard and the Northwest, this 1999 CSUMB graduate knew she had the potential to do something more.
</p><p>“It became very disheartening, and I wanted a job that was more proactive and preventative in nature. So that is how I directed my education,” said Hoover, who received a B.S. in Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy.
</p><p>For her senior capstone project, Hoover measured the water quality of runoff flowing from the outfalls in Monterey. She attributes her current career to the ESSP’s strong scientific foundation.
</p><p>Today, she is director of water quality protection for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within the program Hoover and her staff work with cities to implement storm water management, assist agricultural industry efforts to reduce runoff into the ocean, and educate the community about preserving the Earth’s most valuable resource – water.
</p><p>“We all contribute to the pollution entering the sanctuary,” she said, “and we are all part of the solution.”
</p><h4>Public invited to free workshop Dec. 6</h4><p>“Save the Carmel River – Conserve Water Today” is the topic of the last class of the year offered by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The free, hourlong class will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 6 in the OLLI annex, located on the corner of Inter-Garrison Road and Sixth Avenue on the CSUMB campus.
</p><p>The session will be led by CSUMB students Erin Frolli, Jessica Chapman, Kat Miller and Sarah Jeffries.

</p><h3>Monologues tell women's stories</h3><p>The Vagina Monologues returns to CSU Monterey Bay Feb. 12, 13 and 14.
</p><p>The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the "Vagina Monologues" tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world.
</p><p>CSUMB's production is student&#45;run, student&#45;directed and features student actors. The monologues address issues such as rape, birth, sex and relationships; some are serious, some are funny, all are enlightening and explore new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.
</p><p>The play's staging at CSUMB is part of this year's V&#45;Day campaign. V&#45;Day's mission: to celebrate women and girls and to stop the sexual violence being perpetrated against them all over the world. V&#45;Day has raised millions of dollars since it started 15 years ago and has been named one of Worth Magazine's "100 Best Charities." V&#45;Day has grown exponentially, from an underground feminist event to a mainstream media one. Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine's Day.
</p><p>The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about violence against women. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to local organizations working to do just that. This year's production will feature new monologues. Parents, please note the mature content and adult themes of the play.

</p><p>For more than a century, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority has been committed to public service, with a primary focus on the black community. Now, there is a chapter at CSU Monterey Bay, the first historically African American sorority established on campus. The Upsilon Xi chapter was chartered in April with seven members: Diamond Gaskins, Shiyla Goodie, Nancy Her, Brigette Johnson, Tyler Posey, Courtney Thomas and Tiffany Williams.
</p><p>The chapter plans service projects for the fall that focus on physical and mental health issues that include all students, specifically geared toward under-represented women.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the largest black Greek organization in the country. More than a thousand chapters have initiated 200,000 members. It was founded in 1913 at Howard University to promote academic excellence and provide assistance to those in need.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the eighth sorority to be chartered at CSUMB; six fraternities are also active. (A complete list can be found <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/multicultural-greek-council-0">here</a>.)
</p><p>"We are grateful for CSUMB's enthusiastic support for a collegiate chapter. Upsilon Xi will extend Delta's legacy of scholarship, service and sisterhood to the campus community, while connecting members committed to public service," said Brenda Grayson Shinault, the chapter's primary adviser and a member of the sorority’s Monterey Peninsula alumnae chapter.

</p><h3>Kinship Center collaborates with CSUMB</h3><p>Cal State Monterey Bay faculty member Kathryn England-Aytes believes in the power of real-world experience. As a lecturer in psychology, she works to give her students a chance to learn first-hand from professionals. This semester, students in her clinical psychology course are getting that opportunity thanks to a collaboration with the Kinship Center, a nonprofit that provides mental health and counseling services to children and families touched by adoption, foster care, relative caregiving or legal guardianship. Professionals at the Kinship Center are providing students with a look at the field of child welfare and mental health. Using clinical theory, hands-on activities and lectures at the center’s Salinas campus, the course brings real-life applications to students considering careers in the mental health field. The Kinship Center, a member of the Seneca Family of Agencies, has been honored nationally for its life-changing outcomes for more than 2,500 children each year through therapeutic foster care, kinship (relative) care, mental health services for children and families, intensive support for families in crisis, prevention programs to keep children out of child welfare, adoption and education and training for parents and professionals. “We’re excited about this collaboration,” Professor England-Aytes said. “It’s already connecting students with the community in ways that make us proud." Kinship staff members will deliver six lectures during the course of the semester, covering topics including cultural issues, child trauma, behavioral psychotherapy, group and family therapy and working with children and adolescents. After two lectures, students are clearly enthusiastic. Student evaluations have included these comments:
</p><p>?• “This experience has helped me choose my area of future study.” • “Great information from first-hand accounts.” • “The lectures get me thinking about what I really want to do with my education.” Kinship co-founder Carol Biddle said she is “delighted” to partner with the university to give students a better understanding of the practical applications of their educational program. She noted that the center has hired a number of CSUMB psychology graduates over the years. The center has also provided placements for students in CSUMB’s master’s program in social work, including two former students of England-Aytes.
</p><p>"Being able to share our remarkable psychology students with the mental health care community before they are seeking career positions is helpful for them; Kinship Center makes it truly meaningful," Professor England-Aytes said. <a href="http://csumb.edu/psychology">Learn about the psychology program at CSUMB</a>. <a href="http://www.kinshipcenter.org">Learn about the Kinship Center</a>

</p><p><strong>CHECK OUT THE VIDEO FROM THE MISSION <a href="http://isc.gso.uri.edu/oceanslive">HERE</a></strong>
</p><p>On Oct. 12, Dr. James Lindholm and graduate student Jessica Watson embarked on a scientific mission inside the world's only undersea research station.
</p><p>The station, named the Aquarius Undersea Laboratory, is similar to the International Space Station. But while astronauts explore outer space, "aquanauts explore inner space," said Watson.
</p><p>The pair, along with four other researchers, will live underwater for 10 days, diving eight hours a day to study coral reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Two other CSUMB students, Chelsea Parrish-Kuhn and Alexandra Davis, are also in Florida, working from the surface to support the underwater team.
</p><p>The Aquarius is about the size of a mobile home. It's equipped with hot showers, an Internet connection and other communications equipment. (And it's loaded with freeze-dried "hiker foods, reconstituted with hot water," Dr. Lindholm said.)
</p><p>It's owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and operated by the University of North Carolina Wilmington. It sits 60 feet underwater, four miles from shore off Key Largo. Its mission: scientific research, coral reef and ocean observation, undersea technology development, training, and ocean education and outreach. Since 1994, it has hosted 90 missions.
</p><p>The current mission is entitled "Aquarius 2010: If Reefs Could Talk." It is designed to bring the science of ocean conservation and the underwater world to classrooms and communities nationwide. Live broadcasts each day will focus on biodiversity, climate change and technology for field science.
</p><p>Although the aquanauts will be taking the time to conduct live broadcasts, their main focus is still the science behind the mission. They are studying the behavioral interactions of fishes that live in a range of coral habitats across the reef area.
</p><p>Living in Aquarius, Dr. Lindholm said, allows scientists to conduct research over an extended period of time. It's called saturation diving, when the body is completely saturated with nitrogen.
</p><p>Surface diving allows scientists a limited amount of time to reach the bottom and collect data before the body begins to "bend" ­– experiencing pain, said Dr. Lindholm, director of the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology or IfAME at CSUMB. But with saturation diving, he said, they can spend hours each day swimming with the fish they are studying.
</p><p>"There's a lot more time to observe things, things that you may not see elsewhere," he said.
</p><p>All this information will help marine biologists everywhere have a much better understanding of coral reef communities and how diverse species interact to find prey and avoid predators.
</p><p>The reason for the educational component is simple: A more informed public will make better decisions about what they do in their everyday lives and how those actions impact the world's most important resource – the oceans.
</p><p>This is Dr. Lindholm's fifth saturation mission and Watson's first.
</p><p>"I'm so thankful to have this opportunity," she said a few days before leaving for Florida. "I'll get to see the fish I'm studying." For her master's thesis, Watson is exploring how the feeding and swimming behaviors of three kinds of fish influence their movements.

</p><h3>‘Harold Heath’ is back in the water</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s new research vessel, the Harold Heath, was launched on May 16 after three months of extensive work in dry dock.
</p><p>Santa Cruz attorney Paul Meltzer donated the 46-foot Hatteras sport fishing yacht to the university last December. The boat was renamed “Harold Heath” in honor of Mr. Meltzer’s great-grandfather, a marine scientist and Stanford University professor.
</p><p>With the refitting – which included mounting sonar devices and other equipment – the vessel is ready for use by CSUMB’s Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML), where it will support marine research, training and education. It is also equipped to support remotely operated vehicles and habitat survey work done by the university’s Institute for Applied Marine Ecology.
</p><p>After the launch in Moss Landing Harbor, finishing touches were added in preparation for the SFML’s field season this summer.
</p><p>That work involves mapping the last remaining section of state waters, along the southern Big Sur coast. “Because of the remote nature of this part of the coast, the work will require that we spend four or five days at a time at sea,” said Rikk Kvitek, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the lab.
</p><p>“The Hatteras – which can accommodate a crew of five for extended stays at sea – is ideal for this work.”
</p><p>The SFML has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California’s state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles. The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>Once the seafloor mapping project is finished, the boat will be used as a base for launching smaller vessels, like jet skis, rigged with video equipment and other devices to conduct further research near coastlines and other hard-to-reach spots.

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay was a finalist for the Presidential Award as part of the 2012 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition a college or university can receive for its commitment to community service.
</p><p>The Corporation for National and Community Service received applications from more than 640 colleges and universities. Five received the Presidential Award; 14 were named finalists.
</p><p>In 2006, the program’s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one of three recipients of the top award. It has been named to the Honor Roll each year since then. The university earned the top honor again last year, making it the only two-time recipient of the President’s Award.
</p><p>"Not only is service learning woven into our curriculum," President Dianne Harrison said, "it also is part of our university's ethos of engaging with and contributing to our surrounding communities."
</p><p>The university was honored in the category of general community service, which recognizes the quality of and commitment to community service initiatives, and emphasizes long-term partnerships and measurable outcomes as a result of the service.

</p><p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB’s students enroll in service learning courses contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies in the tri-county area. And service learning is an academic department, where issues of service, diversity, social justice and social responsibility are linked to the core curriculum.
</p><p>“It’s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally and even internationally,” said Dr. Seth Pollack, director of CSUMB’s Service Learning Institute.
</p><p>“No other university in the country has made as significant a commitment to developing students’ capacity for service and social responsibility,” Dr. Pollack said.
</p><p>“We have a very special program, and it feels great to again be recognized as a national leader.”
</p><p>The awards ceremony was held March 12 in Los Angeles.
</p><p>According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors, including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the school’s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and measurable community outcomes as a result of the service. <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/">Learn more about the Service Learning Institute at CSUMB</a>.
</p><h3>Lysley Tenorio visits campus April 8 as part of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month</h3><p>Short-story writer Lysley Tenorio will read from his work April 8 at CSU Monterey Bay. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Tenorio is the author of <em>Monstress</em>, which binds together eight tales of isolated misfits in San Francisco and the Philippines. They have been described as “tender” and “quirky,” written from the point of view of charlatans, B movie starlets, superhero obsessives and transgender cocktail waitresses.
</p><p>NPR said of the stories: “Filipino traditions meet Californian modernity again and again, each encounter revealing something unexpected about both cultures.”
</p><p>The roots of Tenorio's tales are buried in his family's decision to immigrate to California when he was 7 months old. He grew up in a home eager to assimilate.
</p><p>His stories have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine and <em>The Best New American Voices</em> and Pushcart Prize anthologies. A Whiting Writer's Award winner and a former Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, he has received fellowships from the University of Wisconsin and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</p><p>Tenorio lives in San Francisco and is an associate professor at Saint Mary’s College of California.
</p><p>The event will be held at 7 p.m. in the University Center living room, located on Sixth Avenue and B Street. While the reading is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>. 
</p><p>Tenorio’s appearance is part of CSUMB’s celebration of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month and is part of a series of readings called Writers from the Edge. In March, poet Aimee Suzara read from her first full-length collection, <em>Souvenir</em>. The series started in February with a reading by novelist Keenan Norris.
</p><p>For more information, contact Professor Ernest Stromberg at 582-3114.
</p><p>The reading is sponsored by the Division of Humanities and Communication; the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; Student Activities and Leadership Development; Asian Pacific Islander Association; and the Office of Inclusive Excellence.
</p><p><em>Tenorio…has taken a uniquely Filipino-American perspective, polyglot and glittering with cinema dreams, and used it to make a bold collection of stories of the rejected, the helpless and the lost. Monstress is the debut of a singular talent.</em> ?– NPR

</p><p>Head baseball coach Walt White’s tenure at CSUMB is off to a good start with the early signing of nine recruits for fall 2011.
</p><p>“This is the best early-sign class I have had in my 16 years of coaching,” White said. “This is a deep, balanced, dynamic, and athletic class that will come in and have a huge impact on our program. Every one of these players has great baseball ability, but more importantly, they bring an attitude and personality to our program that will set the tone for this baseball team from here on out.”
</p><p>With the new recruits, White thinks his team will have the potential to emerge as a national power.
</p><p>“The recruiting process by our staff was all about building relationships, trust, and the belief in our program by these players. This is the first step of something very special. We will put this recruiting class up against any other one in the nation . . . at any level.”
</p><p>The recruits are:
</p><p>• Matt Blake, right-handed pitcher from West Ranch High School. Blake was part of two playoff teams in the very tough Foothill Athletic League. Through fall games, he sports a 1.81 ERA.
</p><p>• Chris Blanton, first baseman, outfielder, left-handed pitcher from Burlingame High School. Blanton’s team won the Central Coast Section Division II Championship in 2010. As a junior, he was named All-Peninsula Athletic League first team, All-San Mateo County first team and All-Northern California second team. Blanton was also named to the all-tournament team in the prestigious NorCal World Series. He holds Burlington school records for RBI in a game (6) and in a season (37).
</p><p>• Steven Farnworth, right-handed pitcher from West Ranch High School. In the Valley Invitational League, Farnworth compiled a 2.62 ERA with 32 strikeouts in 24 innings, and a 4.5 strikeout/walk ratio. • Devin Finn, outfielder from Amador Valley High School. Finn led his team to an East Bay Athletic League title and the first North Coast Section title in school history. During his junior year, Finn batted .330 with five doubles. • Nolan Flashman, right-handed pitcher from University High School. During his junior season at University, Flashman earned an All-League first team selection with a 4-2 record, 2.28 ERA and.197 opponent batting average. He was also dominant at the plate, hitting .426 with 30 RBI.
</p><p>• Garrett Gemgnani, catcher from Culver City High School. As a junior, he was the most valuable player in the Ocean Athletic League, batting .326 with 30 runs scored and 32 runs batted in while flashing supreme defensive skills. • Matt Urakami, infielder from Branham High School. An All-Blossom Valley Athletic League first team infielder in 2010, he hit .402 with a .622 slugging percentage and a .510 on-base percentage. He is widely considered one of the premier defensive players in Northern California. • Cody Van Aken, right-handed pitcher and catcher from Live Oak High School. Van Aken is a threat on the mound and behind the plate. The All-Blossom Valley Athletic League first-team selection batted .391 with a .596 slugging percentage and 18 runs batted in. As a pitcher he went 4-3, striking out 29 batters in 35 innings. • Jesse White, catcher from Salinas High School. White led the Cowboys to a 22-8 record in 2010 behind the plate with his stellar glove work and rocket arm. He was named to the All-Tri-County Athletic League second team.
</p><p>Coach White joined CSUMB in July after 15 seasons as an assistant at Sonoma State. In 2008, he was instrumental in leading the Seawolves to a third-place finish in the NCAA Division II World Series after winning the CCAA and NCAA West Regional championships.
</p><p>He was the starting shortstop at Sonoma State in 1993 and 1994, then spent five seasons in the Florida Marlins minor-league system and three years at Triple A Tucson in the Arizona Diamondbacks’ organization. In 2002, he returned to Sonoma State to earn his bachelor’s degree in kinesiology. In 2005, he received a master’s degree in education from the University of Phoenix.

</p><p>CSUMB had a notable fall sports season when it came to academics. Thirty-two student-athletes were selected for CCAA all-academic teams. – <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Dec. 19, 2014
</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater will present a tribute to the greatest hits of the 1950s and ’60s when The Alley Cats perform on Oct. 20.
</p><p>Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>By bringing their own contemporary style to tunes from that era, The Alley Cats appeal to fans of all ages, breathing new life into everyone's favorite doo-wop classics.
</p><p>For the uninitiated, doo-wop is an ebullient, rhythm and blues-fueled harmony vocal style where one person sings lead and the others harmonize or mimic the sounds of instruments behind them. It rose to prominence in the 1950s. The first real boy bands, before N’Sync and the Backstreet Boys, were doo-wop groups like the Del Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts, and in the Motown era, The Temptations, Four Tops and Miracles.
</p><p>The four members of The Alley Cats are a perfect blend both vocally and personally. Every Alley Cat performance is accompanied by the sounds of laughter and voices joining in to sing the melodies we all know and love.
</p><p>The Cats' engaging wit and humor have won over audiences nationally as they relate directly to the crowd with jokes, stories and audience participation that appeals to young and old alike. Tight harmonies, universal humor, and unbelievable a cappella energy have made The Alley Cats America's premier doo-wop group.
</p><p>The group has performed with Jay Leno, the Beach Boys and at the White House.
</p><p>Tickets are $40 premium, $29 general. Discounts are available for students and seniors. Tickets can be purchased online at csumb.edu/worldtheater or by calling the box office at 582-4580.

</p><p>The CSU Monterey Bay’s fall athletic teams – cross country, soccer and volleyball – kicked off their 2011 seasons on Aug. 15 with each team’s first official practice.
</p><p>The Otter soccer programs are under new leadership, with Rob Cummings guiding the men's side and Erin Reinke leading the women's team. With a lot of new faces, both squads will strive to garner some attention in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) this season.
</p><p>“I'm not sure how much you actually learn from the very first practice, but it was great to finally get out on the field and start working,” Cummings said. “We have a lot of new faces and it will be fun to start putting the pieces together.”
</p><p>Reinke echoed that feeling.
</p><p>“It's great to finally get everybody on the field,” Reinke said. “This is an important time for us. The work and preparation we do over the next few weeks is where we will learn to compete at the level we expect.”
</p><p>Practicing on a freshly resurfaced floor in the Kelp Bed, the Otter volleyball student-athletes came out crushing balls. Their focus is on preparing for their first game, a newly scheduled home match-up against Notre Dame de Namur on Aug. 30.
</p><p>“Day 1 is down,” said volleyball head coach Jody Garry. “I was really impressed with our returning starting libero Dionna Lucas. You can tell she had another good summer.”
</p><p>The key to any team is defense and the defensive leader, Garry said.
</p><p>The men's and women's cross country teams will field the most talented runners in program history. The full squad of 25 can be found running the old Fort Ord trails.
</p><p>“It was almost overwhelming seeing so many new faces on the first day,” said cross-country head coach Greg Rhines. “It was very exciting to see so many talented runners training together.”

</p><p>Elementary and middle-school students from across Monterey County are jump-starting their college careers with a summer program at the local state university. As part of CSU Monterey Bay's Junior Otters program, now in its third year, 240 migrant education students are practicing their math and language arts skills on the college campus. – The Salinas Californian, July 23, 2011
</p><p>With a computer keystroke on July 29, President Dianne Harrison filed a report that earned CSU Monterey Bay a gold rating from the nation’s leading advocacy group for sustainability in higher education. The university is one of only 18 institutions to receive that distinction.
</p><p>CSUMB becomes the first campus in the California State University system and the second public university in California to qualify for the gold rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.
</p><p>The rating, awarded in the organization's STARS program, signifies that the university is doing an outstanding job of going “green” in areas ranging from curriculum and construction to conservation of resources. STARS – which stands for Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System – measures and encourages sustainability in education and research, operations, and planning, administration and engagement.
</p><p>The rating is the result of a thorough, yearlong self-evaluation process that involved faculty, staff and students. STARS is a widely used sustainability self-assessment tool that helps colleges evaluate and publicly report how they’re doing, where they can improve, what peers are doing and mark progress over time.
</p><p>Examples of CSUMB’s sustainable practices: • Education and research: All students are required to take service learning courses that address sustainability; 35 percent of tenure-track faculty members are conducting research relating to sustainability. • Waste reduction: 90 percent of construction and demolition debris is diverted from landfills. • Water conservation: drought-tolerant landscaping, waterless urinals • Energy efficiency: reduced energy consumption by more than 25 percent over five years • Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions: All members of the campus community have access to free public transportation throughout the region.
</p><p>“The idea of sustainability is embedded in the curriculum here at CSUMB,” said Kevin Saunders, vice president for administration and finance. “We’re educating the region on these issues.”
</p><p>And because it is embedded in the curriculum, “Our students – who are our future leaders – can move through their lives and careers with this ethic of sustainability,” President Harrison said. In the innovation category, the university earned the maximum four points for: • The annual Focus the Region event, a daylong teach-in on environmental issues  • The Chinatown Renewal Project, an effort to help revitalize a blighted though historically rich neighborhood in Salinas. Sustainability has been a consistent theme in these efforts, which include a community garden where organic food is grown; workshops on natural building techniques; a composting enterprise; a solar-energy-generating gazebo; and a vermiculture micro-enterprise. • Planning for and use of electric vehicles • The TRIPwise program, an effort to educate the campus community about alternate forms of transportation and make them accessible.
</p><p>With the evaluation complete, CSUMB will continue to seek further gains in such areas as energy management, alternative transportation and waste reduction.
</p><p>“This is a starting point,” President Harrison said. “We know there are many more things we can do."  
</p><p>John Avella has been elected to the Monterey County Hospitality Association’s board of directors. Dr. Avella, assistant professor of hospitality management and hotel/resort management in CSU Monterey Bay's School of Business, will join the board in January. He’ll serve on the association’s education committee. His background includes 40 years of human resource development and teaching experience in the hospitality industry and higher education. He has been vice president of human resources for Marriott Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the World, and president of Human Resource Concepts. His work focused on management and executive development, customer service and organizational strategic change. His clients included Marriott Corporation, University of Florida, and Hilton Hotels, to name a few. Dr. Avella has taught on the graduate and undergraduate level at Columbia University, Empire State College, Fairleigh Dickinson University and City University of New York. In 2001, he was director of human resources for the food service group at the Salt Lake City Olympics – an operation that served 125,000 meals per day. In 2011, he was a consultant on tourism issues in Anhui Province, China. He has a doctorate from Columbia University, with a concentration in Adult and Organizational Learning. Among his research interests is the application of emotional intelligence to customer service/loyalty, emotional labor and leadership. He has developed a process that teaches people to “connect” to the customer and staff to create loyalty.

</p><p>Each year, hundreds of CSU students study abroad. Some debate international politics in Germany, some savor gelato in Italy, some learn about architecture – and enjoy the beaches of South Africa. This year, Guadalupe Arias is one of 81 CSU Monterey Bay students studying in 26 countries. The senior humanities major from Sacramento is spending the year at the Universidad de Granada in southern Spain.
</p><p>Like Arias, the majority of CSUMB students who study abroad do so for a full academic year.
</p><p>“We encourage students to stay that long in order to learn the language and customs and feel like a local rather than a traveler," said Holly White, CSUMB's international program manager.
</p><p>As she begins her second semester, Arias said she has adapted quite well to the culture and customs of Spain.
</p><p>“I start my day with a warm <em>café con leche</em>, a Spanish <em>tostada</em> and fresh orange juice,” she wrote in a photo essay on the CSU website. “From 2 to 4 in the afternoon, the Spanish have their siestas. At the beginning, I felt guilty for having two hours to nap and relax, but I have adjusted to the Spanish way of living. “I use that free time to do homework or take walks around the city.” She reported that she’s enjoying her classes and likes Granada’s proximity to the Mediterranean.  “I left home with an open mind and ready to absorb other cultures. Half of Granada’s population is composed of students from all over Europe and the Americas. I have learned so much about other parts of the world since I’ve been here,” she said. “This is my new home.” View a photo essay of Arias’ time in Spain <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/ip/photo-essays/country/spain/2011/arias/">here</a>.

</p><h3>Annual event celebrates legacy of late labor leader </h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay will be closed on March 30 in honor of Cesar Chavez.  Chavez led the non-violent movement for farm workers’ rights, a movement that extended beyond the fields and into cities and towns across the nation, and helped found the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farm Workers (UFW). Even with campus closed, the university community is still in action. On that day, and during the following weeks, many faculty, staff and students dedicate their time to both service and learning. ??March 30 will mark the start of CSUMB’s second annual Cesar Chavez Challenge, a 36-day community service drive – it ends on Cinco de Mayo – coordinated by the Purposeful Service Opportunities program. PSO is a joint project of the AmeriCorps VIP program and the Service Learning Institute. The theme for this year’s challenge is “Creating a Culture of Service,” and involves a friendly competition among student clubs, Greek organizations, athletic teams and residence halls to document 3,600 hours of service.
</p><p>This year, extra points will be awarded for uploading photos to a Facebook page that show volunteers at work, and registering for an online volunteer account with the Volunteer Center of Monterey County. Also new this year: Points will be awarded for philanthropic efforts, such as fundraisers and food drives, and for civic engagement, such as voter registration and attendance at city council meetings.
</p><p>Registration, contest rules and point system can be found <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/cesar-chavez-challenge">here</a>. Volunteer opportunities on or around Cesar Chavez Day include: • The Comics for Kids fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monterey County, March 27-31
</p><p>• The PURSUIT Youth Expo at the University Center ballroom, April 13. Mandatory volunteer training, March 31 • The 30-Hour Famine, sponsored by the Otter Christian Fellowship, March 30 and 31 • <a href="http://ron.csumb.edu/">Return of the Natives</a> clean-up effort, March 31

</p><p><em>The end of all education should surely be service to others. – Cesar Chavez</em>  
</p><p>Oct. 12, 2010
</p><p>As part of the California Library Association's "Snapshot: One Day in the Life of California Libraries," CSU Monterey Bay joined others throughout the state – including 19 other CSU campuses – to gather statistics for a typical day.
</p><p>All information was collected for one day during the week of Oct. 4; CSUMB collected its data on Oct. 5.
</p><p>The information reflects the libraries' invaluable services and will be used to advocate for libraries in Sacramento in November. Insights gathered from "snapshot" data will also help the CSU libraries improve and enhance their collections and services, according to the CSU Chancellor's Office.
</p><p>On Oct. 5, nearly 3,700 people visited the Tanimura and Antle Family Memorial Library at CSUMB. Kathlene Hanson, the library's electronic resources coordinator who was in charge of gathering data, said that number needs to be put in context.
</p><p>It represents the total number of times people walked through the doors. "That includes everyone who used the building as a shortcut to get from the café side to the classroom side; and, it counts people who entered multiple times," she said. "Nevertheless, it's an impressive number."
</p><p>Perhaps more important is the number of times the library's website was accessed that day: 40,670. Nearly 400 people used the library's computers, and another 600 used their own computers in the building.
</p><p>Despite today's transition to digital media, the American Library Association reports that visits to college libraries are on the rise – partly due to the fact that academic libraries are adapting to meet students' changing needs.
</p><p>University libraries are unique. Not only do they foster research and innovation, they prepare students to enter the knowledge&#45;based workforce upon graduation.
</p><p>Support for academic success is the primary mission of the CSUMB library. It's student&#45;centered, with student&#45;friendly spaces for study, for group work, and for co&#45;curricular programs. It's an active social space &#40;with a café and outdoor patio&#41; that supports student learning.
</p><p>Like other modern libraries, the one at CSUMB is collaborative, technology&#45;infused and adaptive to change. It's a place to get access to information in many formats and from many sources. Mobile access as well as "Ask a Librarian," a program that allows students to get help via instant messaging, are extending services beyond the physical walls of the building.
</p><p>Kim Bui&#45;Burton, California Library Association president and director of the Monterey Public Library, has pointed out that library usage is up across the state and demand is growing for books and other resources, knowledgeable staff assistance and computer/Internet access – despite budget cuts, reduced hours and programs.
</p><p>"Snapshot" statistics will demonstrate to decision makers the extent that students, other library users and future leaders rely on California libraries for critical services, resources and programs – "now, more than ever," Bui&#45;Burton said.

</p><p><strong>Francisco Alarcon among poets at CSUMB on Oct. 28</strong>
</p><p>Francisco Alarcon, Odilia Galvan Rodriguez and Abel Salas will be featured at Voces de Justicia-Voices of Justice, a poetry reading to be held at 7 p.m. Oct. 28 in the University Center ballroom at CSU Monterey Bay. The event is free and open to the public. 
</p><p>Alarcon, award-winning Chicano poet and educator born in Los Angeles, has written 11 volumes of poetry. He teaches at the University of California at Davis, where he directs the Spanish for Native Speakers program.
</p><p>Moved by student protests against Arizona's immigration law, he created a Facebook page called Poets Responding to SB 1070. Many of the poems from the page have been republished on La Bloga at labloga.blogspot.com.
</p><p>He told the Tucson Weekly that he started the Facebook page on April 20, when he saw the demonstration in front of the Arizona State Capitol, and learned that nine students had been arrested.
</p><p>"Those Latino students were sitting in front of the Capitol, very Gandhi-like in nonviolence, protesting the xenophobia of SB 1070," he told the paper. "In response, I wrote a poem, 'For the Capitol Nine.' . . . I posted it on my Facebook page, and I kept getting a lot of responses. Now, we have more than 3,500 members."
</p><p>He added that his Facebook page gets responses about the posted poems from all kinds of writers, all over the world. "That means there are a number of poets who
</p><p>have taken the time and are motivated to respond to this discriminatory law."
</p><p>Galvan Rodriguez and Salas, who work with Alarcon to moderate the Facebook page, will also read their work at CSUMB.
</p><p>Galvan Rodriguez is a poet, writer and teacher. She teaches writing workshops, "Empowering People Through Creative Writing."
</p><p>Salas has written for the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine and is editor and publisher of Brooklyn &amp; Boyle, an L.A. arts, culture and community paper. He occasionally teaches creative writing in Los Angeles County juvenile halls. His poetry has appeared in a variety of publications.
</p><p>All three poets will answer questions and copies of Alarcon's books will be available for purchase. He'll sign copies before and after the reading.
</p><p>The reading is sponsored by the Department of Human Communication, Student Activities and Leadership Development, and the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><p>When Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, arrives, family members of departed souls set out water, candles, food and decorated sugar skulls to welcome their lost loved ones. Widely celebrated in Latin America, the day honors the dead as living entities. It celebrates the departed, and helps keep them present in life.
</p><p>This year's Dia de los Muertos celebration at California State University, Monterey Bay, will be held on Nov. 2.
</p><p>The free event will begin at 6 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue with performances by Aztec dancers and musicians and will include a processional, an outdoor exhibition, live music, pan dulce and hot chocolate. The main altar will be displayed in the University Center ballroom; smaller altars constructed by student and community groups will also be on display.
</p><p>Members of the community are invited to honor the memory of their departed relatives and friends by registering them for the university's Wall of Remembrance. A photo, name and brief memorial message can be submitted at <a href="http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm">http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm</a>. Photos, which should be submitted in jpg format no larger than 500kb, will be printed and displayed on our Wall of Remembrance and a candle in each name will be placed on the large community altar.

</p><p><strong>UROC PLAYS BIG ROLE IN SUCCESS OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EFFORTS</strong>
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay students took a first&#45;place award and a third at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science conference Sept. 30&#45;Oct. 3 in Anaheim.
</p><p>Maren Mitch, a McNair Scholar who works in the campus laboratory of Professor Corey Garza, won first prize in the undergraduate poster competition in marine biology. Approximately 60 posters were entered in that category.
</p><p>Mitch &#40;pictured at left&#41; is a senior Environmental Science, Technology and Policy major.
</p><p>According to Dr. Garza, "The judging was razor thin. The deciding factor was the fact that in addition to having a broader understanding of her project's relevance, it was clear to the judges that Maren was conducting her own research as opposed to working on a small part of a larger project."
</p><p>Mitch looked at how to use GIS models to predict the distribution and abundance of sea stars as a function of intertidal habitat complexity in Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Dr. Garza added that the judges were impressed that CSUMB students are able to integrate geospatial technologies into their research as undergraduates.
</p><p>Anthony Basilio, another marine science student, took third place. He is studying fish bio&#45;mechanics at Moss Landing Marine Labs.
</p><p>Both students are part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center. With training and support from UROC, students work on innovative research projects at CSU Monterey Bay and at regional research institutions. Their work is guided by a research mentor and includes training in proposal writing, presentation and communication skills. It also helps students apply to graduate school. <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Learn more about UROC.</a>
</p><p>SACNAS presents the poster sessions at its annual conference to help students prepare for science careers and the rigors of professional conferences.

</p><p>Dr. Jack Tchen, keynote speaker at the Salinas Chinatown: Once and Again Symposium on Oct. 15,  told the gathering of 200 people at CSU Monterey Bay, "We, too, are in search of America."
</p><p>He was referring to the subtitle of John Steinbeck's book, <em>Travels with Charley</em>. "In some ways," he said, "the legacy of Steinbeck's writing is what keeps us going."
</p><p>Dr. Tchen, a historian, professor at New York University and co-founder of New York's Museum of Chinese in America, as well as several other museum professionals and artists were invited to the university to talk about the Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum, which will be housed in the former Republic Café on Soledad Street. They were joined by university faculty members, students and community members.
</p><p>Dr. Tchen (pictured at right) pointed out that the museum will be important nationally, because it will share a history that is often overlooked. Most Asian cultural museums represent the urban experience. The one in Salinas will cover the rural and agricultural history of the Chinese, Japanese and Filipino communities who lived there from the nineteenth century into the 1950s.
</p><p>Karin Higa, curator of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, advised the group to define "community" broadly as it goes about the work of preparing the museum to open its doors.
</p><p>Wellington Lee, Wally Ahtye, Alfred Baguio and Larry Hirahara – community members with ties to Chinatown ­– talked about their experiences.
</p><p>A plea for community members to share their artifacts and their memories of Chinatown was made by Dr. Lila Staples, who teaches museum studies classes at CSUMB. In collaboration with the National Steinbeck Center, Dr. Staples and her students are assembling the material that will be displayed in the center.
</p><p>The last words came from architect Richard Fe Tom, who drew up the plans for the museum.
</p><p>"You guys are going to get there. It's just a matter of time," he told the group.

</p><p>Andrea Valdez, a senior biology major, is on a microbe mission. Valdez, in conjunction with Dr. Gretchen Hofmann’s lab at UC Santa Barbara, is studying a wasting disease contributing to the recent demise of sea stars, a keystone species in the near&#45;shore environment. Valdez is using molecular techniques to determine the diversity of bacterial organisms found on sea stars with wasting disease, and comparing them to bacterial populations on healthy sea stars.
</p><p>The work, which comprises much of the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program application that Valdez is writing this semester, will contribute to a greater understanding of this complex disease. Valdez began the study in Hofmann’s lab last summer, and continues it this semester in the campus lab of <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/staff/aparna/aparna/Welcome.html">Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan</a>. She is funded in part by the <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu/lsamp">Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation</a> and CSUMB’s <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a>, and hopes to present this project at regional and national conferences this year. She has also found time to serve other students in a variety of ways. She’s an officer in the university’s chapter of Beta Beta Beta, the national biological honor society; helps other students through the Peer&#45;to&#45;Peer Mentor program; works as a teaching assistant for molecular biology and organic chemistry courses; and co&#45;directed last semester’s Undergraduate Research Week events.

</p><h3>CSUMB to host Startup Weekend Jan. 23-25</h3><p>Ever wonder what it takes to be an entrepreneur? CSU Monterey Bay will be a great place to find out when the university hosts Startup Weekend Monterey Bay Jan. 23&#45;25. Startup Weekend will connect local entrepreneurs, developers, designers and startup enthusiasts with mentors and resources. Throughout the course of this 54&#45;hour event, attendees will share ideas, form teams and launch startups.“Startup Weekend is a great way to get into entrepreneurship and test it out, said Mary Jo Zenk, a member of the organizing team. “This event will foster an innovating environment for entrepreneurs to share, vet and launch their ideas.” Here’s how it works: The weekend opens with open mic pitches on Friday, where attendees are encouraged to bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. You don't have to have an idea to attend. Teams form around the top ideas &#40;as deemed by popular vote&#41; and then it’s a 54&#45;hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing and market validation.
</p><p>On Sunday evening, teams demonstrate their prototypes in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback. Startup veterans and mentors – including faculty members and local entrepreneurs – will be on hand throughout the weekend to provide expertise and give talks on their experiences. About 70 people participated in CSUMB’s Startup Weekend in 2014. With the help of 18 coaches and five judges, 10 companies were formed over the weekend.
</p><p>The event is organized by the College of Business’ <a href="http://innovation.csumb.edu">Institute for Innovation and Economic Development.</a> The institute focuses on the need for more job opportunities in the region and offers programs that work toward developing entrepreneurs and supporting innovative ideas that lead to new business opportunities. Participants must purchase a ticket prior to the event. Tickets are currently on sale as Early Bird discounted prices of $75 and $39 for students. Tickets will increase to $99 and $49 after Jan. 3. Each ticket includes registration, meals for the weekend, snacks and parking. <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/monterey&#45;bay/startup&#45;weekend/4824">Register here</a>. The public is invited to attend the final team presentations and judging, and to meet these new entrepreneurs starting at 4 p.m., Sunday, Jan. 25. Tickets are $25 and include dinner. <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/monterey&#45;bay/startup&#45;weekend/4824">Register here</a>.

</p><h3>Sacramento visit to advocate against more budget cuts</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison joined Chancellor Charles Reed and her fellow CSU presidents today in a meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown in Sacramento to discuss the state budget and its impact on higher education.
</p><p>Like her counterparts, Harrison was accompanied at the meeting by a local business leader, Mary Ann Leffel, president of the Monterey County Business Council.
</p><p>Harrison said she was encouraged by Brown's continued commitment to avoiding an "all-cuts" budget for fiscal year 2011-2012, which could mean a $1 billion reduction in funding for the CSU.
</p><p>"The governor clearly understands how devastating an all-cuts budget would be to our universities and to the people of California," Harrison said. "We are all looking to the Legislature to fulfill its responsibilities and support the extension of needed revenue."
</p><p>Brown's proposed budget contains a $500 million cut to the CSU, which would result in a deep $5.1 million funding cut to CSUMB. If necessary state taxes are not extended, an additional system-wide cut of up to $500 million would force the CSU to increase tuition up to an additional 32 percent and possibly close admissions for 2012.
</p><p>Harrison said the debate over extending the taxes is more philosophical than financial – a fundamental choice about whether California should maintain its investment in such basic services as higher education and public safety.
</p><p>"If we're not going to invest in these things, then we will have to deal with the ramifications," she said.
</p><p>Leffel, who emphasized the role of higher education in preparing a workforce to meet local needs, said a decline in state support means that more qualified students will be shut out of the state's public universities.
</p><p>"Educating fewer students will slow our economic recovery and ultimately lead to a smaller tax base,” she said.  
</p><h2>Ejan headed to Washington, D.C.</h2><p>Jihan Ejan, a retention adviser with the Center for Student Success at CSU Monterey Bay, was chosen to participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Kika de la Garza Education Fellowship Program this summer in Washington, D.C.
</p><p>The program is named for the Texas Congressman and former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. It is part of the USDA’s Hispanic-Serving Institutions program.
</p><p>Ejan is one of 13 college and university faculty and staff members chosen for this year’s program. Fellows experience first-hand the education policymaking process and build linkages to research and funding opportunities. In addition to meeting with USDA personnel, fellows connect with and work on short-term projects with other federal agencies and organizations such as the Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Commerce Department, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
</p><p>She will be in Washington from June 26 through July 16.
</p><p>“The opportunity to be a Fellow will further my understanding of the educational challenges and career opportunities facing the Latino community,” Ejan said. “With this information, I hope to be a better advocate and adviser. The fellowship will give me ideas on how to better serve our students.”
</p><p>Ejan joined the university in July of 2010. She earned bachelor’s degrees in sociology and Asian American Studies from UC Davis and a master’s degree in counseling with an emphasis in college student personnel counseling from San Francisco State University.
</p><p>Her work experience includes academic and career counseling, mentoring, college retention, college outreach and recruitment, admissions evaluations and teaching. She has worked with students at all levels – from elementary school through university. She previously worked at CSU Channel Islands, UC Berkeley, City College of San Francisco, and for the nonprofit League of United Latin American Citizens National Educational Service Centers, Inc.
</p><h3>Dining Commons event raises more than $1,000</h3><p>It seems that people and food come together in times of great tragedy.
</p><p>After the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan, Aya Kamata, an international student from that country, contacted Campus Dining at CSU Monterey Bay with the idea of featuring Japanese cuisine as a fundraising opportunity.
</p><p>Kamata and Sodexo, the university's food service provider, had worked together in the fall semester when her entry in the “Favorites from Home” contest was selected as one of the winners. She had submitted a recipe for tonkatsu, a meal traditionally served in Japan before a major competition – such as an exam or sports event.
</p><p>Charles Wesley, campus general manager for Sodexo, readily agreed to the idea. As a result, Tuesday, March 29, was designated Japanese Relief Day. Food from that country was offered all day in the Dining Commons. Fifty percent of cash sales  – on all food sold, not just the Japanese dishes – was donated to the relief effort. By the end of the day, more than $1,000 had been raised.
</p><p>During the lunch and dinner hours that day, visitors to the Dining Commons were able to get a lesson in origami (Japanese paper folding), get their name written in Japanese characters and learn some basic facts about the country.
</p><p>Japanese exchange students at CSUMB, as well as students in the Japan Club and the International Club began raising money to help victims almost immediately after news reports broke. By March 17, when most students left campus for spring break, $700 had been raised. That money was  donated to the Japan Democratic Medical Organization. Donations are still being collected at various locations around campus.

</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay now offers a Professional Science Master’s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy. The new program complements the traditional, thesis-based master of science degree in applied marine and watershed science that has been offered at CSUMB for five years.
</p><p>The “plus” element includes a professional internship and training in advanced geospatial technologies; professional and scientific communication; scientific ethics; and environmental economics and policy analysis.
</p><p>Students typically do their internships in the second year, or over the summer between the first and second years of the program. Some work on campus in the Seafloor Mapping Lab and the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology. Others work with government agencies such as NASA and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as with environmental consulting groups and non-profit agencies.
</p><p>Sixteen students are enrolled this semester. “We capped it at 16 because we wanted to be able to place them in the best internships,” said Dr. Susan Alexander, director of the program.
</p><p>“Students find this new option appealing because of the ability to link applied marine and watershed science to professional skills and jobs,” she said.
</p><p>“Many of the students we’re seeing are returning professionals. They have several years of work experience and are looking to gain advanced scientific and technical skills that will help them move forward in their careers.”
</p><p>Academic research groups, government agencies and non-profits are likely to employ these graduates, but the program will also address the needs of regional “green” business and consulting firms.
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay volleyball coach Jody Garry says this year’s squad is “not afraid to lose.” As the 2010 season continues, it is very clear they aren’t afraid to win, either.
</p><p>The Otters piled up a 10-2 record by early October, earning a no. 21 national ranking and demonstrating the chemistry that Garry strives for.
</p><p>“We’re playing as a team and not as six individuals on the court,” said junior Rheann Fall, an outside hitter from Elk Grove, who on Sept. 21 was named NCAA Division II National Player of the Week by the American Volleyball Coaches Association.
</p><p>Fall’s strong performance in the season’s opening weeks was capped by her school-record 29 kills in the Otters’ thrilling 3-2 victory over No. 11-ranked UC San Diego. A kill is a spiked shot that is not returned by the other team, resulting in a point.
</p><p>Even with the Otters’ strong start this season, Garry said she’s equally excited about the team’s future, thanks to a strong recruiting effort that brought in four promising freshmen, including three from the Monterey-San Jose region.
</p><p>“Yes, we’re going to do well this year,” she said, reflecting back on last year’s 13-19 record. “But we’re going to get better and better and better. It’s not a quick fix. I’m not a quick fix coach.”
</p><p>Garry credits the success of CSUMB volleyball camps, including free Youth Otter Clinics this spring for youngsters in eighth grade and under, paid for with grant funds.
</p><p>Through the camps, the recruits had a chance to meet her and the returning players, as well as spend time on campus.
</p><p>“They knew me; they knew my program,” said Garry, who is now in her fourth season at CSUMB. “They assimilated so well. The key is to have that relationship.”
</p><p>The Otters can’t match most conference opponents in size or strength, she said, so they have to be smarter.
</p><p>“They’re not the biggest, they’re not the fastest,” Garry said. “They’re just kids who are willing to put the work in.”

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay's first class of 10 nursing graduates participated in a pinning ceremony on Dec. 20. The ceremony marked a milestone for the students and for the university. – &#42;Monterey Herald&#42;, Dec. 31, 2014
</p><p>Generations of California elementary school students have visited the adobe missions that dot the state from San Diego to Sonoma. The 21 missions, begun in 1769 by Father Junipero Serra, had a big impact on Dr. Ruben Mendoza.
</p><p>“My interest in history started on a fourth-grade field trip from my home in Fresno to Mission San Juan Bautista,” Dr. Mendoza explained. “I fell in love with it, but I wanted to know more.”
</p><p>That school trip ignited a lifelong passion.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza went on to earn an undergraduate degree from CSU Bakersfield and graduate degrees in archaeology at the University of Arizona. He came to CSU Monterey Bay as a founding faculty member in 1995.
</p><p>A chance meeting with the pastor of Mission San Juan Bautista resulted in an invitation to work there. That was 15 years ago. Since then, he’s worked at many of the California missions, as well as some in the American Southwest and Mexico. Dr. Mendoza is also a charter board member of the California Missions Foundation. He’s become the local go-to expert on the subject and one of only a handful of mission archaeology and conservation specialists in California.
</p><p>Students in CSUMB’s Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies can pursue a concentration in archaeology. Each year, 15 to 20 students do so, many of them attracted by the prospect of working with Dr. Mendoza. Some continue on to graduate school. Public agencies and contractors hire others. Because much of the California coast is archaeologically sensitive, contractors need trained people to determine whether an area under construction is historically significant.
</p><h5>Hands-on-learning</h5><p>When asked what appeals to students about the subject, Dr. Mendoza has a ready answer. “They see it as sexy, interesting ... the ‘Indiana Jones’ mystique. My job is to demystify the field,” he said. He may “demystify” it, but he does it in a way that attracts students.
</p><p>Adrian Lopez, a 2007 graduate of CSUMB, is pursuing a master’s degree in urban and regional planning at San José State University, focusing on historic preservation. That interest is the result of Lopez’s work at the Soledad Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista and the Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey while enrolled in Dr. Mendoza’s classes.
</p><p>“He’s involved with students in a very direct way,” Lopez said. “He’s an educator, a motivator and an inspiration. He inspired me to continue my education.”
</p><p>When they work with him at the missions, students take on specific community service projects. Some of what they do involves answering questions from the public, conducting tours and installing museum exhibits. They also do fieldwork, learning to identify, catalog and interpret their findings through the science of archaeology, and they learn about public service.
</p><p>“There’s nothing better than putting them in the field for hands-on work,” Dr. Mendoza said.
</p><p>Brenna Wheelis enrolled in his Mission Archaeology class in 2007 to fulfill a Service Learning requirement. “I was hooked. I completed over 160 Service Learning hours that semester,” she said, well beyond what she needed.
</p><p>Since graduating last spring, Wheelis has been part of the excavation and recovery of a Native American burial site in Carmel Valley, and she co-authored a historic structures report on the 1932 Maryknoll Rectory at Mission San Juan Bautista with Dr. Mendoza. Many of his students are cited in his scholarly publications for their contributions to the work.
</p><p>“He’s highly accessible to his students,” Wheelis said, “and never discourages their curiosity. He takes a genuine interest in what his students think ... and creates a curriculum that develops individual scholarship. He’s had a tremendous influence on my decision to apply to graduate school in order to pursue archaeology as a career.”
</p><h5>"Column of light"</h5><p>Digging into the missions’ past is more than an academic exercise or teaching tool for Dr. Mendoza. He believes that knowing what went on there helps us understand who we are today, and how California became what it is.
</p><p>Asked to name the most significant work he’s done, he didn’t hesitate.
</p><p>“Discovering the Serra chapels at the Royal Presidio of Monterey,” he said. He’s referring to the discoveries in the summer of 2008 of the “first” and “second” chapels, each consisting of rectangular adobe buildings located directly in front of the present San Carlos Cathedral (constructed in 1791-95). The area marks the spot where, in 1770, Father Junipero Serra celebrated the earliest Mass in a formally constructed church on the California coast.
</p><p>“And the solstice studies are turning out to be a big thing. It’s like a Dan Brown novel,” he said, referring to the author of ‘The Da Vinci Code.’
</p><p>“I’m looking at symbology, iconography and ancient secrets. I’ve got competitors, I’ve got collaborators.”
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza has documented that 12 missions in California alone are aligned to mark the winter or summer solstice. The solar geometry was first brought to his attention on the morning of Dec. 21, 1997, at Mission San Juan Bautista by the pastor, when the altar was bathed in sunlight, casting what he calls “an intense column of light” directly on the tabernacle. He is convinced it’s the result of a deliberate design by the Spanish missionaries who built the missions.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza predicted and documented a similar illumination at Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Carmel on the summer solstice on June 21, 2003. He has gone on to document scores of other solstice and feast day sites in the American Southwest and Mexico and presented his findings before the Society for American Archaeology in St. Louis this April.
</p><p>The public will have an opportunity to learn more about Dr. Mendoza’s work at Mission San Juan Bautista. PBS television plans a documentary on the archaeology, historiography and conservation efforts there.
</p><p>Mission study is an emerging field, he said: “There’s so much that’s unknown. Many records have not yet been scrutinized. We’re in a post-colonial era. What happened in the colonial era?
</p><p>“No answer you give in this moment will hold in the next moment. For me, that’s exciting,” he said. “When I see the fourth-graders at the mission ... I do this for them.”
</p><p>Fortune shone on Stacy Mauzey of Salinas the day in 2009 when she met Carolee Bull. "Without Dr. Bull's help, I wouldn't be where I am today," Mauzey said. "Working with her has proven to be consciousness-raising."

</p><p>Twenty&#45;nine students and two faculty members from CSU Monterey Bay are preparing income taxes for free during the next few months at various locations around the area through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program. VITA is coordinated by the United Way of Monterey County.
</p><p>The volunteer tax&#45;preparers took training classes over the semester break and were certified by the IRS through an exam before beginning to work with clients. The student volunteers come from the university's School of Business. Most are in the accounting concentration; some are satisfying their service&#45;learning requirement.
</p><p>The service is available at four locations in Salinas, and in Seaside, Castroville, Soledad and King City. Some students also work at locations in Santa Cruz County.
</p><p>This is the second year that business students and faculty members are volunteering with the program. Approximately $100,000 in income tax refunds was returned to clients, and by extension, the local community, as a result of their work last year.
</p><p>Susan Morse, service&#45;learning instructor in the School of Business, is “always looking for ways to incorporate community involvement addressing issues of justice, culture and equity with activities that use and expand students’ business skills,” she said. “VITA does both.”
</p><p>Accounting professor Cathy Ku was also involved with recruiting students and coordinating the various agencies involved.
</p><p>The program reaches out to low&#45;income wage earners who can’t afford income tax preparation assistance or are not aware that they may be eligible for tax refunds. To be eligible for the program, household income must be less than $49,000.
</p><p>“The community also benefits from an infusion of otherwise lost income as the refunds are, for the most part, spent locally,” Morse said.

</p><h2>Meatless Monday returns to campus</h2><p>If you're thinking of having a burger for lunch at CSU Monterey Bay – and it's a Monday – you might want to reconsider that choice.
</p><p>An initiative by Sodexo, the university's food service provider, is highlighting meatless options at all five campus dining locations every Monday during the school year. They're making it easy for diners to abstain from eating meat one day a week.
</p><p>If you're a carnivore and you've already scarfed down a double cheeseburger, don't worry. You're not in trouble. It's voluntary.
</p><p>"The idea isn't to take any choices away," said Tyler McBrian, Sodexo's campus marketing and sustainability manager. "The idea is to add vegetarian options and to make them visible," he said.
</p><p>Sodexo is doing that by featuring a special serving station for vegetarian fare in the Dining Commons.
</p><p>In addition, the library café features veggie hummus wraps, the Otter Express offers veggie sandwiches and the Otter Bay Restaurant has a new Meatless Monday option every week.
</p><p>The company's website says it is offering more vegetarian fare to improve students' health and reduce their environmental impact.
</p><p>"Did you know that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to make one pound of beef," McBrian asks people.
</p><p>The Meatless Monday trend is sweeping through learning institutions from elementary to graduate schools. Pioneers include UC Davis, Yale University and the Baltimore City schools.
</p><p>Dozens of colleges and universities now highlight meatless options each week, according to Sodexo. Many of the efforts to bring Meatless Monday to campuses were student&#45;led, a testament to increased awareness about the connections between diet and overall health. Each college has added its own promotion style to the campaign, including videos, Facebook pages and pledge drives.
</p><p>And it's not just schools that have signed on to the idea.
</p><p>When celebrity chef Mario Batali starts to push people to eat their vegetables, you know something is happening. The famous chef and restaurant owner has joined the Meatless Monday movement, which is backed by a broad array of public&#45;health advocates.
</p><p>In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a study of fruit and vegetable consumption. It found that only 26 percent of adults eat vegetables three or more times a day – which falls far short of guidelines set by the federal government. When it comes to fruits and vegetables, the average American eats less than half of what public health officials suggest. And that figure hasn't budged since 2000.
</p><p>Nor is the idea new. During World War I, people were urged to skip meat one day a week as a rationing effort. Now, that idea has been reinvented as a hip, easy way to be environmentally friendly and health conscious.

</p><p>Oct. 26, 2010  A redesigned website for Cal State Monterey Bay debuted on Oct. 25, after more than a year of work by members of the Strategic Communications and Information Technology departments and an outside contractor, White Whale Web Services of Oakland.
</p><p>Dozens of staff members and students gathered for the official launch in the University Center Living Room. President Dianne Harrison cut the ribbon that “launched” the site. “Today is an exciting day for our campus,” Dr. Harrison told the group. “This is a massive undertaking. Our website reflects who we are, what our identity is, what kind of research our faculty and students are doing . . . the website reflects the personality of the campus.” She quoted an Information Technology student as saying: “ ‘I feel like this website reflects me as a student.’ And that’s the best thing that can be said.” Chief Information Officer Chip Lenno explained that the site was created using open source software. “As of today, we have contributed more than 25,000 lines of code back to the open-source community,” he said with obvious pride. The president and founder of White Whale, Jason Pontius, was complimentary of CSUMB’s web team. “We work with a number of colleges and universities, and I have never in my career worked with a team of people who were as calm, confident and prepared for this re-design,” he told the gathering, singling out Elizabeth MacDonald, Kevin Miller, Kevin Garcia and Greg Pool by name. “The code has been masterful . . . ,” he added, a reference to Miller’s work. In addition to the people Pontius named, many others worked behind the scenes to make the redesign successful, including Joan Iguban and Molly Nance of Strategic Communications, Paul Hall of IT and student assistant Chi Tran. The redesigned site features work contributed by members of the campus community, including student-produced photos and videos. The site has also been geared for ease of use, with a blend of need-to-know information and room to click around and discover unexpected stories about the university, and its students and faculty.
</p><h3>Photographer Jeff Sheng lectures at CSUMB Nov. 30</h3><p>The President’s Speaker Series resumes Nov. 30 when photographer Jeff Sheng visits campus. His talk will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater.
</p><p>Sheng, an artist who teaches Asian American studies and photography at UC Santa Barbara, will talk about his work, which deals with sexuality and homophobia. He’ll also talk about his experiences as an activist of color.
</p><p>He’ll present “Fearless,” a series of photos he has worked on since 2003 that depict lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender high school and college athletes who are open about their sexuality.
</p><p>“Fearless” was shown at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and, in the last four years, has toured more than 40 colleges and high schools. It’s exhibited mostly in student centers and gymnasiums – high traffic areas that allow a large audience to see the photos.
</p><p>He’ll also talk about his recent series of photos depicting closeted members of the military, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” In 2008, when “Fearless” was first featured in the national media, Sheng received e-mails from service members, saying they had been moved by the photos. He realized he had found his next project.
</p><p>“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is a series of portraits of gay men and lesbians, all of them shown in uniform but with their faces obscured in some way. In one image, an airman sits on a hotel bed, his hand cupping his face to shield it from the lens. The portrait conveys a sense of isolation and loneliness. It’s the image that landed on the book cover, and in Time magazine last February.
</p><p>He traveled around the country to interview and photograph military personnel. At first, he paid his own expenses; later, he was helped by a grant.
</p><p>While the “Fearless” photos were shot on film, Sheng used a digital camera for “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” That way, he could show his subjects their pictures right away – and so, he told the New York Times, help build their trust.
</p><p>He describes his subjects, identified only by pseudonyms, as people who didn’t want to risk their careers, but wanted to take some kind of stand.
</p><p>The photos have attracted national attention and have been featured in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, ABC World News, Time magazine, NPR and the BBC, among other media outlets.
</p><p>“I think photographs have the power to move people that sometimes words don't," Sheng says. "And you look at these images and what you see is that people who are gay look very similar, the same, as people you would assume to be straight. That's a powerful message.”
</p><p>In conjunction with the lecture, “Fearless” will be exhibited on campus. From Nov. 8-19, the photos can be seen in the University Center on Sixth Avenue during normal business hours. From Nov. 22-30, the photos will be displayed in the lobby of the World Theater. Please call the theater at (831) 582-4580 for exhibit times.
</p><p>The lecture and exhibit are free. Reservations for the lecture are recommended and can be made online at csumb.edu/speakers. For more information, or to request disability accommodations, call (831) 582-4580.  
</p><p>The dozen students who were selected to receive scholarships from the Fort Ord Alumni Association cover the spectrum of academic majors available at Cal State Monterey Bay: human communication; business; liberal studies; global studies; teledramatic arts and technology; environmental science, technology and policy; health and human services; marine science; kinesiology.
</p><p>And they aspire to varied careers: sports journalist; pharmacist; public relations practitioner; master chef; teacher; filmmaker; environmental engineer; nurse; scientist; physical therapist.
</p><p>One plans to study abroad; two are members of the university’s athletic teams; some come from military families or have been on active duty; all have served their communities in some way.
</p><p>What the 12 students have in common is the ability to embrace the opportunities that life offers. The awards, which were given at the association’s annual luncheon on Oct. 27, bring to 112 the total number of scholarships – all in the amount of $1,000 – given by FOAA since its scholarship program began. The Fort Ord Alumni Association was established in 1996 – shortly after the university opened its doors on a portion of the former Army base – to provide financial assistance to students and to honor and preserve the heritage of Fort Ord and the contributions of the soldiers, civilians and their families who lived and worked there. Membership is open to anyone who wishes to join in these efforts. This year, more than 140 scholarship applications were received. Grade-point average, leadership, participation in extra-curricular activities and volunteer work at school or in the local community were considered in the evaluation process. Recipients and the scholarships they were awarded:

</p><p>Huddled over a gray robot, a student pushed the start button and watched as the small machine lurched forward, completed a turn and moved toward an obstacle.
</p><p>Then disaster struck. The robot veered off course, driving over white masking tape and spinning around several times – disqualifying the team that programmed it.
</p><p>It was back to the computer for a team of students in the First Year Seminar: Otter DotCom class.
</p><p>The class is part of Project Higher Ground, a program where students live in the same dormitory (in this case, Avocet Hall) and take at least two classes together.
</p><p>The 25 students in the class formed themselves into eight teams. Each team assembled a Lego Mindstorm robot, then programmed it via computer “to do what we want,” one student explained.
</p><p>The teams competed on a recent Thursday morning. Each team’s bot covered two courses. One was an oval-shaped track (think NASCAR); the robots had to stay inside a set of parallel lines marked off with masking tape. The other course was oddly shaped and was covered twice, once with obstacles obstructing the way, the other obstacle-free.
</p><p>The competitive part of it clearly engaged the students.
</p><p>“We even made a test track in the lobby of their dorm, so they could practice over the weekend when the lab was locked,” said Dr. Kate Lockwood, assistant professor of Computer Science and Information Technology.
</p><p>Team No. 4 – whose robot was named “Cookie” – was the overall winner. Team members Megan Louth, Ryan Lorea and Chris Carpenter piloted Cookie to victory on the oval track, and covered the obstacle course – successfully avoiding the pair of obstacles placed in its way – in 42.3 seconds to top that race as well.
</p><p>Winner of the obstacle-free race was Team No. 5, whose robot was named “Yellow” (for the color of the Lego box, they said). Members of the team: Gonzalo Sanchez, Brayant Galvez and Ben Fulanovich.
</p><p>If you’re interested in robots, there’ll be another opportunity to see them in competition.
</p><p>In mid-December, students in Dr. Sathya Narayanan’s computer architecture class will face off with sumo wrestling robots they have assembled, wired and programmed.
</p><p>Art historian Laura Meyer comes to campus on Nov. 10 as the visiting artist lecture series continues.
</p><p>Dr. Meyer is the author of “A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Experiment,” and organized an exhibition and symposium on that theme last year at Fresno State University. Her work documents the nation’s first feminist art education program, which was established at Fresno State in 1970, and its enduring legacy in contemporary art. Meeting off campus in a Studio of Their Own, 15 female students and instructor Judy Chicago helped pioneer key strategies of the early feminist art movement, including collaboration, the use of “female technologies” such as costume, performance, and video, and early forms of media critique.
</p><p>Many art history textbooks trace the roots of feminist art education in the U.S. to the program established by Chicago and Miriam Schapiro at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, overlooking its beginnings at Fresno State the previous year. “A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Experiment” highlights previously undocumented painting, sculpture, photography, film, installation, and performance art produced during the first year of the Fresno experiment, as well as recent work by program participants. Together, all helped lay the groundwork for what one critic has called “a whole new relationship between art and society.” Dr. Meyer earned an MFA in painting from CSU Los Angeles and a Ph.D. in art history from UCLA. She is an associate professor of modern and contemporary art at Fresno State. The event, sponsored by the Department of Visual and Public Art, will start with a reception at 6 p.m., followed by the lecture at 6:30 in the University Center living room. The public is invited. No reservations are needed for this free event.
</p><p>Earl Lawson was sworn in as the chief of police at Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 2, three weeks after university President Dianne Harrison named him to the position.
</p><p>Several dozen members of local law enforcement agencies joined the campus community to witness Nate Johnson, chief law enforcement officer for the California State University system, administer the traditional oath of office.
</p><p>Lawson’s wife, America, pinned the chief’s badge on while their daughter, Brianna, looked on.
</p><p>Lawson has served in a number of important roles since joining the University Police Department in 1995, most recently as operations lieutenant and briefly as interim police chief upon the retirement of former chief Fred Hardee in June.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison said Lawson was selected for the breadth of his experience, which includes special training in disaster preparedness and collaboration with local law enforcement. “Chief Lawson understands that the police department is essential to ensuring a safe environment for our students, employees and visitors and helping to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and personal growth,” she said. “I know he will do an outstanding job.” Praise came from Chief Johnson, who called Lawson “an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the big picture.” In his brief remarks, Lawson reiterated his commitment to the university. “This is my home; the people on this campus are my extended family. I’m heavily invested in the success of this university,” he said. His top priorities are to expand the university’s emergency preparedness and community policing programs. He promised to be “accessible and flexible,” and to “always do what I think is right for the community.” Lawson has a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Cal Poly Pomona and a minor certificate in criminal justice. His extensive professional education includes training at the FBI National Academy. He started his law enforcement career in 1993.

</p><h4>Slack key maestro George Kahumoku presents holiday concert</h4><p>“Slackheads” will get a rare treat on Dec. 11, when Grammy-winning slack-key guitarist George Kahumoku brings a bit of the islands to Cal State Monterey Bay’s World Theater for a Hawaiian holiday show.
</p><p>And in the true spirit of Hawaiian family tradition, Kahumoku will be joined on stage by his wife and son, Keoki, an accomplished musician and entertainer.
</p><p>The performance isn’t just for transplanted Hawaiians. It’s a chance for lovers of diverse music to hear a style that – despite a rich tradition – isn’t all that well known on the mainland.
</p><p>Slack-key performances have a laid-back Hawaiian feel, with performers “talking story” between songs, spinning yarns and tales from back home.
</p><p>In contrast to many Hawaiian traditions, the slack-key guitar style is a relatively recent invention. Spanish and Mexican cowboys introduced the acoustic guitar to the islands in 1830. The Hawaiians quickly developed their own style of playing, which became known as slack key.
</p><p>The term refers to a finger-picking guitar style, in which one or more strings are loosened – slacked – to change the tuning. The guitarist can then play the bass and treble parts of the music, which makes it sound as if several guitars are playing at once. One result is a ringing sound that lingers behind the melodies being picked.
</p><p>And Kahumoku is one of the best. He’s been called Hawaii’s Renaissance man, and with good reason. He’s a songwriter, performer, high school and college teacher, artist, sculptor, storyteller, writer, farmer and entrepreneur.
</p><p>He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. Following a stint working on the Alaska pipeline, he returned to Maui, where he teaches drawing, painting, ceramics, guitar and ukulele at a high school and at Maui Community College. When he’s not teaching, he’s working on his three-acre farm, tending his goats, chickens and ducks and growing vegetables and fruit. He’s a busy man. Kahumoku’s music and voice have been described as "earthy and organic – one with the `aina (the land)." His love and respect for Hawaii and planet Earth are embedded in his music, which he likes to think of as nature songs: songs of love, hope, desire, and lament.
</p><p>He’s played for Elizabeth Taylor; for 15 years, Henry “the Fonz” Winkler requested his presence at his new Year’s Eve parties; he’s even played for the Queen of England.
</p><p>In a 2002 interview with Santa Cruz’s weekly publication, Good Times, he said, “This music gives you a sense of balance, completeness, even to the guy that’s playing it as well as the listener; . . . you feel that <em>one</em>, almost with the universe."
</p><p>Bring the entire family for this evening of story, song and dance from the enchanting islands. Tickets range from $10 to $33 and can be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580 or online at csumb.edu/worldtheater. The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue on the CSUMB campus. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h4>Former Army medic pursuing degree in health and human services</h4><p>Heather Cusson’s local roots run deep, but a circuitous route brought her to Cal State Monterey Bay. She grew up in Carmel Valley. Her father was stationed at Fort Ord during the Vietnam War. Her uncle graduated from CSU Monterey Bay. And now Cusson, 26, is a junior transfer student at the university, majoring in Collaborative Health and Human Services. She hopes one day to be a public health nurse — a dream backed up by two tours in Afghanistan as an Army medic. Her experience in Afghanistan — administering medical care to locals in remote villages, assisting in the treatment of gunshot wounds, amputations, burns and blast injuries to American soldiers — reinforced her passion to pursue a career in health care. When she returned to the U.S., she hoped to find a job as a trauma specialist but her lack of formal education in the field prevented that. Instead, she enrolled in Monterey Peninsula College. “Like most veterans, I was unaware of services that were available for someone in my situation. But thanks to the help of the veterans’ representatives at Monterey Peninsula College and CSUMB, I was guided down the right educational path,” she said. After earning an associate’s degree in 2010, she applied to MPC’s Maurine Church Coburn School of Nursing. When she realized that the school has a three-year waiting list, she decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree at CSUMB in the interim. “I believe the CHHS department really promotes making a positive impact in the community. A career in health and human services will provide me with a sense of service, similar to what I felt in the Army,” she said. Transition from Army life to civilian life has been challenging for Cusson. There’s a lack of the “Army family” she once knew so well. Luckily for her, she has support from her brother and husband, both veterans. And the fact that CSUMB is on the grounds of the former Fort Ord Army base is helping her, too. With former military buildings around campus, Cusson is reminded of her days at Fort Drum, N.Y., where she was stationed. “Having my classes in these kinds of buildings is welcoming. I also enjoy taking the time to observe the footprints left behind by fellow soldiers,” she said. At CSUMB, Cusson is in the company of other veterans. Last spring, 53 CSUMB student veterans were using various GI Bill benefits (38 of them using the new Post 9/11 GI Bill) and another 20 were using the Dependents Educational Assistance program as eligible dependents of veterans. And 89 students were eligible for the College Fee Waiver Program for Veterans' Dependents through the California Department of Veterans Affairs. These students, as family members of disabled or deceased veterans, receive a waiver of fees. This fall, 48 students are using the Post 9/11 GI Bill program. Among the university’s military-friendly practices are web pages with information specifically for veterans; a specially designated counselor and support team to help veterans make the transition from active duty service to accomplishing their personal educational goals; and a Student Veterans Organization that is currently in the planning stages. Cusson knows she is surrounded by people and resources that will keep her on the right track to obtain her dream job. “As far as the everyday transition, I’m still confronting issues of post-traumatic stress. However, I feel like I’m lucky to live in a community that acknowledges and supports my struggles as a veteran,” Cusson said. <em>– By Molly Nance, University Advancement</em>
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay can claim to be one of the best places to work in the county – for the second time in three years.
</p><p>That’s according to the Monterey County Business Council's “Best Places to Work” study. The purpose of the program is to provide vital information to local companies about the practices they use to attract and retain talented employees.
</p><p>Employers were recognized in two categories – those with 75 or fewer employees and those with more than 75. Two organizations in each category were honored.
</p><p>More than 40 businesses applied for the awards. Winners in the small business category were Medialocate, a language-services company, and the Central Coast Federal Credit Union. Robert Mann Packaging joined CSUMB as a winner in the large-employer division.
</p><p>Personal Dynamics Consulting of Florida designed a 40-question survey used to identify the top employers. Turnover rates, growth percentages, spending on employee development, insurance packages and retirement plans were among the 37 measurements used to determine the area’s “Best Places to Work.”
</p><p>CSUMB President Dianne Harrison accepted the award on Sept. 24.
</p><p>The Monterey County Business Council includes professionals from business, government and education working together on countywide issues. Founded in 1995, the nonprofit corporation seeks to promote the concept of private-public partnerships by bringing business experience and techniques to the public arena.
</p><p>The Nov. 13 performance of December People at the World Theater was sold out, with standing room only. Another high point of the evening was the success of the theater’s food drive.
</p><p>The drive was a collaboration between the World Theater and radio station HIPPO 104.3 FM. Food for people and pets was collected and donated to the food banks of Monterey and San Benito counties and the Monterey County SPCA. The World Theater lobby was filled with an estimated 2,000 lbs. of donated food to help those in need during the holiday season.
</p><p>“Because of the fantastic audience response and the food drive, the producers plan to bring December People and the canned food drive back again next year,” said Joe Cardinalli, director of the World Theater.
</p><p>Over at Campus Dining services, through the generosity of CSUMB students, staff and faculty, and the sponsorship of Sodexo, the Helping Hands Food Drive netted 965 lbs. of food in time for needy families at Thanksgiving. The food was donated to the Food Bank for Monterey County.
</p><p>The drive is an annual event put on every October and November by Sodexo. This year, students could donate meal plan blocks which campus dining converted into food. The food was converted into bulk items such as bags of rice, cake and brownie mix, canned milk and vegetables.
</p><p>“On the last day of the food drive, Otter Athletics joined in and asked community members to donate canned food for admission to the women's basketball game,” said Jennifer Harris, marketing and  sustainability manager for Sodexo campus dining. “They added nearly 200 lbs of food in one night.”
</p><p>Due to the support from the campus community and Otter Athletics, the Helping Hands Food Drive donated nine times more food than last year.  
</p><p>A donor wall, memorializing the contributions of significant donors to the university, was unveiled Oct. 9 at the Alumni &amp; Visitors Center during an annual dinner in appreciation of the university’s largest donors.
</p><p>The wall contains the names of 120 donors, both individuals and organizations, with room for many more to be added in the years to come. Each name signifies a cumulative donation of $25,000 or more. The wall lists various “society” giving levels, ranging from $25,000 to over the $10 million level.
</p><p>“The donor wall will be updated with new names each year,” said Pilar Gose, annual giving officer in University Advancement. “When the wall was unveiled at the donor dinner, the guests who were recognized for their generosity really loved it.”
</p><p>An existing donor wall in the lobby of the University Center also lists donations, but it has not been updated since 2006. It will remain there, but will no longer be the memorial of record for future contributions.  
</p><h4>Local resources for parents, teachers is topic of Dec. 1 event</h4><p>With the diagnosis rate estimated to be 1 in 110 children, it’s imperative that parents and teachers of students with autism know what local resources are available.
</p><p>That topic will be addressed at Cal State Monterey Bay on Dec. 1 when the university’s chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children and the state CEC sponsor a free panel discussion from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>“Meeting the Needs of Students with Autism: Community Perspectives” will feature panelists Laura Harris, executive director of local nonprofit Special Kids Crusade; Stella Lauerman, community services manager of Easter Seals Central California; and Marcia Weber-Olsen, program specialist with Monterey County’s Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).
</p><p>Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor of special education at CSUMB, will be the moderator.
</p><p>Students, parents, teachers and community members with an interest in autism are invited to attend. A light dinner will be provided.
</p><p>Please RSVP to Jacquelline Means at 582-4612. For more information, contact Dr. Cathi Draper Rodriguez at 582-3652.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><h3>President's speaker series continues Jan. 30</h3><p>“America Fast Forward?: Demographic Shifts, Economic Challenges, and the Future of California” will be the topic addressed by University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor on Jan. 30, when the President’s Speaker Series resumes at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The social and economic changes in California in the last few decades foreshadowed what is now happening in the nation as a whole; indeed, the demographic change in the state between 1980 and 2000 is what the U.S. is projected to experience between 2000 and 2050.
</p><p>In our passage, rising immigration, widening inequality, and a strained fiscal system challenged the state &#40;and now the nation&#41;, but we are now at a critical turnaround as our demography stabilizes, our economy catches its breath, and public finances are finally on &#40;slightly&#41; firmer ground.
</p><p>What’s ahead for the Golden State? How do we ensure economic, social and environmental sustainability for the next generation of Californians? And what are the lessons for a nation experiencing widening divides by income, geography and politics?
</p><p>Dr. Pastor is a professor of sociology and American Studies &amp; Ethnicity at USC. He directs the university’s Program for Environmental and Regional Equity and the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. His research focuses on movement building and the economic, environmental and social conditions facing low&#45;income communities.
</p><p>He has written several books and speaks nationally on issues including demographic change, economic inequality, and community empowerment.
</p><p>His presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. A question&#45;and&#45;answer session and a public reception will follow. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling the World Theater box office at 582&#45;4580 or going <a href="http://csumb.edu/rsvp">online</a>.
</p><p>The theme of this year’s speaker series is “Future Monterey Bay.” During the school year, three speakers will visit campus to address various aspects of the theme. The series kicked off in November with a talk by Stanford University professor and futurist Paul Saffo.
</p><p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay’s role as a community resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought and action on issues important to our community.
</p><p>Rheann Fall, outside hitter on CSUMB's volleyball team,  is the first Otter athlete to earn All-American honors in any sport.
</p><p>Fall was selected to the Daktronics All-American first team on Dec. 2.
</p><p>"Cal State Monterey Bay is very proud of Rheann,” said Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.  “Her work in the classroom and on the court is impressive and we want to thank Daktronics for recognizing this and awarding Rheann this wonderful honor. She has earned it. She is a wonderful teammate and helped lead the team to record heights this year.”
</p><p>It was the second national honor to come her way recently. Earlier in the week, she was named to the the American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American honorable mention team. That's in addition to  her selection to the All-California Collegiate Athletic Association first team.
</p><p>Fall was the CCAA’s leader in kills and finished the season seventh in the nation in points and kills. She recorded 16 double-doubles (kills-digs) and had 20 or more kills 11 times. She also had two matches of 20 or more digs this season.
</p><p>She was named a Sport Import/AVCA National Player of the Week and CCAA Player of the Week after leading CSUMB to two victories over nationally ranked teams.
</p><p>“Coach Garry's approach over the last three years has been consistent and this year has paid off, for Rheann and the team,” Otoupal said.
</p><p>“CSUMB volleyball set records this year. I'm honored to have Rheann as a member of Otter athletics; she is one of those student-athletes who make people around her better."
</p><p>Three decades after the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia, echoes from the Vietnam War still reverberate in 21st-century America. A recently published book edited by Dr. David Anderson, professor of history at CSUMB, offers new perspectives on the political, historical, military and social issues that defined the war and its effects on the U.S. and Vietnam. “The Columbia History of the Vietnam War” opens with an introduction by Dr. Anderson on the war’s major moments and enduring relevance.
</p><p>In it he says, “The history of the American war in Vietnam is not a remote academic subject. It is, or it should be, a continuing and real part of policymaking and public discourse on the role of American power and ideals throughout the world.”
</p><p>Dr. Anderson has published a number of books on the Vietnam War. He is a past president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, and is an Army veteran of Vietnam.
</p><p>Publication of the book followed his participation in an international conference in Washington, D.C., in the fall. He was invited to participate in “The American Experience in Southeast Asia, 1946-1975” by the Bureau of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the Department of State. He participated in a session on the U.S. war debate, “Ours to Reason Why: Intervention in Vietnam, Reaction in America.”
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay’s teacher education program has received a federal grant to help students obtain a special education credential. Over the course of four years, the U.S. Department of Education grant will provide $1.1 million to provide scholarships for people who want to prepare for a career teaching students with disabilities in the Monterey Bay area. The grant will provide scholarships that can be used to cover tuition, fees, textbooks and laptop computers for credential candidates. Grant money will also be used to develop computer technology that will allow students to access course content online, and use video conferencing for field supervision. Candidates will complete the program equipped to teach students with moderate to severe disabilities including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance. Credential candidates will gain field experiences in the tri-county region as well as in high-need schools. “This grant will address the critical shortage of credentialed special educators in the local area,” said Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor in the special education program.
</p><p>“It’s an opportunity for currently employed teachers who lack a credential to earn one. It’s also an excellent opportunity for those with a general education credential who are out of work due to the budget situation to go into special ed,” Dr. Harrower said.
</p><p>The grant will support a total of 40 students and is renewable for as long as a student needs to complete his/her credential. The program is designed to be completed in two years.
</p><p>The first group of students will start in summer and fall 2011. Prospective students must apply to the university and the special education program, then they can complete an application for funding.

</p><p>Works by CSUMB student filmmakers will be on display at the Teledramatic Arts Presentation Showcase Dec. 8 in the TAT Studio on Sixth Avenue. The showing is scheduled to run from 7 to 10 p.m.; doors open at 6:30. The presentation is free and the public is invited.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by the Media Arts Club and will include animations, narratives, documentaries and other short films produced this semester by students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program.
</p><p>The TAT building is located adjacent to the World Theater. A campus map and driving directions are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>The Teldramatic Arts and Technology Building will become a giant canvas on Dec. 15 when students project their work onto the building.
</p><p>The videos were created as final projects in Ben Wood’s TAT 421, Motion Graphics class. They include composited and animated graphics, images and sound. The first video will be screened at 5:45 p.m. onto the front façade of the building. The show will last about an hour.
</p><p>The best place for viewing the projections will be directly in front of the building on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>In his own work as a visual artist, Wood has done a number of large-scale public projections. (View a video of his projection onto Coit Tower in San Francisco <a href="http://www.coitlive.com">here</a>.)
</p><p>“The focus is to produce graphics to be integrated with the architecture of the building in order to animate the structure as an alternative form of electronic cinema . . . as a showcase of what is going on within TAT,” Wood said.
</p><p>During the semester, the class has “covered the tools and methodologies to create animated video, graphics and text which may be applied to fields such as special effects, advertising and independent visual projects,” Wood said.
</p><p>The class created this <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/550337">piece earlier </a>in the semester. It’s representative of the work that will be shown on Dec. 15.

</p><p>As last month's election battle over growth on part of Fort Ord showed, the debate over the future of the former Army base is far from over. To look at the various issues from several angles, CSU Monterey Bay and the Fort Ord Reuse Authority are sponsoring a two-day gathering of experts aimed at the public and local decision-makers. – <em>Monterey Herald</em>, Dec. 6, 2013
</p><p>There are gingerbread bakers and gingerbread artists.
</p><p>And then there are gingerbread overachievers.
</p><p>The group representing Focus the Region, the annual teach-in on climate change, fits into the latter category. The faculty and staff members and the single student on the team came up with a “house” they called CandyLEED Campus. Apparently, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) is flexible enough to apply to all building types – gingerbread as well as wood and cement.
</p><p>Their entry earned enough credits to be awarded a platinum rating, using such things as skylights made from salvaged hard candy, melted and cooled into sheets, a garden with drip irrigation, chocolate bar solar panels and a living sweets roof. And they had a LEED®-accredited professional on hand.
</p><p>For their efforts, Team Focus the Region took first place in CSUMB’s seventh annual gingerbread house contest on Dec. 10. They were awarded a tin of butter cookies, a pizza party for 10 (courtesy of Sodexo) and possession of the trophy until next year’s competition.
</p><p>The contest drew nine teams representing several dozen employees. Each group was given a kit consisting of the basic pieces and encouraged to let their imaginations run wild.
</p><p>A panel was invited to judge the entries. Judges included Ken Turgen of Wald, Runke and Dost architects, and chair of the Marina Planning Commission; Julie Ann Lozano of Monterey Bay Office Systems; Charles Wesley of Sodexo catering; and former CSUMB staff member Courtney Kuhn of Quail Lodge.
</p><p>The judges selected the top three finishers. Those who attended the staff and faculty holiday party on Dec. 10 were invited to cast their vote for the People’s Choice Award. The team representing Student Housing and Residential Life took that honor with their model of Chocolate Mountain from the CandyLand board game.
</p><p>All nine entries were displayed in the lobby of the University Center during the party, and then went to local community organizations for display.

</p><p>Artwork by recent CSUMB graduate Jacob Kernodle is gracing the marketing materials for First Night Monterey – the result of a longstanding relationship between the university and the event’s organizers. This year’s theme for the annual event is “Imagine, Create, Participate.” Members of Professor Bobbi Long’s Publications Design course have been designing the poster and button for First Night Monterey since 2003.
</p><p>“These projects give students real-world experience of working with a client and progressing through various stages of the design process,” said Professor Long.
</p><p>Publication Design is not an art class "where students just have a muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you have to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their ideas, and you interpret that," she said.
</p><p>"This program gives students a chance to show their talents, skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a project." Kernodle combined graphic design, business management, marketing and art to earn a degree in integrated studies. After graduation, he returned home to Shingle Springs, a town in the Gold Country near Placerville, where he plans to start an artists’ collaborative to showcase the work of designers and artists. According to its website, First Night Monterey seeks to foster the public's appreciation of visual and performing arts through an innovative, diverse and high-quality program which provides a shared cultural experience accessible and affordable to all. The centerpiece is its alcohol-free celebration on New Year's Eve in downtown Monterey. The First Night concept was created in 1976 by a group of citizens in Boston. It has grown to include celebrations in over 200 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada. First Night Monterey premiered in 1993. The volunteer core has grown from 50 to 500; the audience has grown from 9,000 to 40,000; and participation as a performing or visual artist becomes more competitive each year. First Night Monterey has won awards for promoting the arts, building community, and creating innovative programming. To learn more about the design program at CSUMB, click here.
</p><p>Graduates of the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU Monterey Bay continue to earn recognition and accolades for their work.
</p><p>For the second consecutive year, the university will be represented at the Sundance Film Festival – the biggest independent film gathering in the U.S.
</p><p>“Prairie Love,” produced by 2003 graduate Douglas Mueller, will have its world premiere in the festival’s NEXT competition. Eight films were selected for their innovative and original work on a budget of less than $500,000 – a pittance in the movie industry. Although the NEXT category is non-competitive, an audience choice award is up for grabs.
</p><p>Over 10,000 films – a record number – were submitted to Sundance this year, and just under 200 were accepted, according to the festival website.
</p><p>Sundance will be held in and around Park City, Utah, Jan. 20-30. “Prairie Love” will be screened four times – Jan. 23, 25, 27 and 28 – and Mueller (pictured at left) plans to be on hand for all of them.
</p><p>“The Teledramatic Arts' faculty and staff are ecstatic for Douglas,” said department chair Enid Baxter Blader. “He remains a highly regarded member of our TAT community. This recent accomplishment is a fantastic recognition of his talent and vision."
</p><p>The film was shot in Minot, N.D., in January 2009. It’s a dark comedy about a nomad traveling the rural roads of North Dakota who saves the life of a stranded man. When the nomad discovers the man is headed to visit a pen-pal girlfriend he has never seen, the nomad assumes his identity in hopes of having a relationship with her.
</p><p>The shooting was completed over 23 days, and in sub-zero weather. “On a rare occasion we would do less than 12 hours, and only because we ran out of daylight,” Mueller said. The weather created problems – “cameras fail at about 20 below” – but the filmmakers didn’t let them derail their plans.
</p><p>As the film’s producer, Mueller’s work took a variety of forms.
</p><p>“I focused on the creative end, as opposed to the business or financial elements,” he said. “I gave the director notes on his script from the start, I worked on storyboards, location scouting, casting, costumes, coordinating between the departments, along with making sure whatever we were shooting next was going to be ready.”
</p><p>He was quick to add that his role included a lot of things that weren’t so much fun – cleaning up, shoveling snow, getting cars out of ditches, and “asking for things for free.”
</p><p>After graduating from Minot High School – where he met several of his colleagues on the film – he was determined to go to school in California. He looked for a small school with a good film department. CSUMB filled the bill on both counts.
</p><p>It was a good fit. “There was always a faculty or staff member who was eager to help me with what I needed and ultimately, I walked away with more experience producing and directing than my friends did at New York University,” Mueller said.
</p><p>He believes that the university gave him a “great” education, “not only about film, but many things. My classes and my peers helped me look at social issues in a way I never had. . . .”
</p><p>When he completed his degree in 2003, he stayed in the area. A year later, he joined the Carmel Bach Festival as production manager, a job he still has. His work with the festival inspired him to make “Intermezzo No. 1,” a short documentary about the festival's keyboard tuner that premiered at the Nashville Film Festival this year and will screen at the Ozark Foothills Festival in 2011.
</p><p>"Doug is one of the students who really kept the dream of making movies,” said TAT instructor Steven Levinson. “He was always a great writer and producer. Once he got into the real world, he seriously applied the ‘real world’ training he got here at CSUMB."

</p><p>Last year’s Sundance festival saw the premiere of “Charlie and the Rabbit” by TAT alums Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck. “Charlie” and their previous film, “Ella and the Astronaut,” were shown at film festivals around the world.
</p><p>They were named to Filmmaker Magazine’s list of “25 New Faces” for 2010, a list recognizing the top up-and-coming talent in the independent film industry.

</p><p>Paul Meltzer, a Santa Cruz attorney, has donated his 46-foot Hatteras sport fishing yacht to CSU Monterey Bay for use in the university’s marine science program.
</p><p>The boat will be renamed “Harold Heath” in honor of his great-grandfather, a marine scientist who was a Stanford University professor for nearly 40 years and led research at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove. Dr. Heath and his family lived across the street from the Marine Station campus.
</p><p>The vessel will be used by CSUMB’s Seafloor Mapping Lab, where it will support marine research, training and education. It will also be used to support remotely operated vehicles and habitat survey work done by the university's Institute for Applied Marine Ecology.
</p><p>“The Harold Heath will allow us to take the Seafloor Mapping Lab to a new level of performance and service,” said Dr. Rikk Kvitek, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the Seafloor Mapping Lab. The lab conducts marine habitat survey work and has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California's state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles. The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>One of the first uses of the Harold Heath will be to map the last remaining section of state waters, along the southern Big Sur coast. “Because of the remote nature of this part of the coast, the work will require that we spend four or five days at a time at sea,” Dr. Kvitek said. “The Hatteras is very well equipped, in excellent condition and is ideally suited for this work.”
</p><p>It’s that kind of useful research that inspired Mr. Meltzer, an avid deep sea fisherman, to make the gift.
</p><p>“The university is conducting interesting and important marine research that will be immediately useful. This is exactly the kind of research project that would have fascinated my great-grandfather. My father was a commercial fisherman and he would have also been thrilled to see a detailed map of the sea floor,” Mr. Meltzer said.
</p><p>Dr. Heath was involved in coastal marine survey research off the coast of California, Alaska, Mexico, Japan and Brazil. He was one of the first professors at Stanford University, where he joined the Department of Zoology in 1894. He spent most of his scientific life at the Palo Alto campus and at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station. He first taught at the Pacific Grove facility in the summer of 1895. Dr. Heath retired in 1933, but continued his research at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. He died in 1951. In a memorial tribute, his Stanford colleagues described him as “kindly, quizzical and inspiring.”
</p><p>The Harold Heath will be berthed along the Coast Guard pier in the Monterey harbor. “We will begin outfitting the boat to support seafloor mapping, diving, remotely operated vehicles and video tow-sled surveys right away,” Dr. Kvitek said.

</p><p>Over the course of the season, the Otters have knocked off two teams that were undefeated, beat a team that was nationally ranked at the time, and stunned Division I UC Santa Barbara.
</p><p>In her third year as head coach, Jimenez has transformed a program that won three games the year before she arrived into a unit that’s forcing opponents to take notice.
</p><p>“There was no timetable to turn the program around,” Jimenez said. “But we didn’t want to sit around and wait.”
</p><p>In her first season, the team won 11 games; last year, it set a school record with 18 wins. To read more about the Otters, click <a href="http://otterathletics.com/index.aspx?path=wbball&amp;">here</a>.
</p><p>Young filmmakers eager to see their work on a screen bigger than YouTube will get the opportunity in April, when Cal State Monterey Bay holds its third annual Teen Film Festival.
</p><p>The Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department is accepting applications for the festival, which will be held at CSUMB's World Theater on April 9. Entries can be submitted online at montereybayfilmfestival.com by Feb. 11.
</p><p>Filmmakers between 13 and 19 years old are invited to submit films and videos up to five minutes in length. Entries may be in English or Spanish and there is no entry fee.
</p><p>TAT students will organize the event and handle the judging, according to Professor Enid Baxter Blader.
</p><p>"It's an educational experience for our students, who want to go out in the world and have their films screened in film festivals. A great way to understand that process is to curate a film festival," Blader said.
</p><p>CSUMB also hopes the festival will serve as a way to interest local teens who might not have considered going to college. By inviting them to campus and showing them what the university offers, they may consider enrolling.
</p><p>While local teenagers are encouraged to enter the competition, it's also open to teenagers from around the world.
</p><p>Last year's event drew more than 200 entries; films were submitted from the Central Coast region as well as Great Britain, El Salvador and Armenia. Some of last year's entries can be viewed online at montereybayfilmfestival.com.
</p><p>The teen festival is part of the larger Monterey Bay Film Festival. MBFF will also feature three programs curated by Mike Plante. Mike is an associate programmer of the Sundance Film Festival, and curates many other festivals internationally. This will be Mike's second year as the programmer of the Monterey Bay Film Festival.
</p><p>Focused on independent short films with innovative technologies, the events and web festival introduce Monterey Bay’s unique opportunities for the film industry.

</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received a $15,000 grant from Bank of America to support its Small Business Development Center, an innovative program that provides counseling and training to small businesses or people who are trying to start them.
</p><p>“The Bank of America grant allows the Small Business Development Center to maximize the efforts of the whole team,” said Andrea Nield, the center’s associate director.
</p><p>“Small Business Development Centers are America’s best-kept secret for businesses. The Bank of America grant will allow us to strengthen our outreach in order to help more aspiring and existing business owners to achieve their goals,” Nield said. The center, which opened in the fall of 2009, is located in a storefront in Gonzales and has other offices in areas that it serves along the Highway 101 corridor from Gilroy to King City. It provides critical services to small business owners, helping them create jobs and solidify the local economy.
</p><p>The center helps people develop business plans, secure financing, set up bookkeeping systems, improve operations, plan for expansion, project cash flow, determine technology needs and provide a variety of other services helpful to small businesses. In addition to the free one-on-one consulting, the center offers a variety of workshops and seminars.
</p><p>Working in partnership with community leaders, Bank of America's local market leadership directs its giving through local grants that address pressing social, economic, and cultural needs of communities served by the bank. Over the last decade, the bank has supported CSUMB’s Recruitment in Science Education program, the Service Learning Institute and the Green Job Corps program.

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay has gotten a prominent mention by a blogger for the Huffington Post. Danielle Wiener-Bronner, who writes about higher education issues for the website, included the university on a list of nine “Forward-Thinking Colleges."
</p><p>“There are myriad colleges and universities that exhibit what the future of higher education looks like. Some are new and some more established, but all nine of the schools mentioned below are distinctive in some way – and are worth watching in 2011,” the blog’s introduction says.
</p><p>“When Cal State Monterey Bay was founded in 1994, it called itself ‘the 21st campus for the 21st century,’ and has proven to be as forward-thinking as promised. The state college – which encourages students of low socio-economic backgrounds to enroll and offers around 70 percent of undergrads financial aid – requires each student to conduct a capstone research project and put together a skills portfolio before graduation,” the university’s entry says.
</p><p>Among other schools on the list are Evergreen State College in Washington, Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, Florida A&amp;M and the Global College of Long Island University.
</p><p>To list is available <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/31/9-forwardthinking-schools_n_803008.html#s217483&amp;title=Cal%20State-Monterey%20Bay%20">here.</a>  
</p><h3>Student-industry networking on the agenda at annual conference</h3><p>Students and faculty from CSU Monterey Bay will join colleagues from other California State University campuses to present research on genes, proteins, cancers, crops, water quality and other topics at the 23rd annual CSU Biotechnology Symposium Jan. 7 and 8 at the Hyatt Regency Orange County. Six CSUMB students – four undergraduates and two master’s degree students – will present their work. Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan, who teaches cell and molecular biology, is one of the organizers of the event and helped to select one of this year’s award winners. CSUMB’s Erin Stanfield is a finalist for the annual Eden Graduate Student Research Award, worth $1,750 to cover educational and travel-related expenses. Stanfield’s research uses molecular methods to tackle a problem in the Monterey Bay area – the presence of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria in local lakes. She worked for more than a year at Pinto Lake in Watsonville; her work will help inform water management agencies around the area and garner new information about how these complex organisms sense their environment and produce toxins. Undergraduates Jen Cleveland, Kevin Johnson, Mark Callaghan and Pierre Boivin and grad student Maren Mitch are also presenting their work at the two-day conference. With roughly 500 CSU students and faculty joining nearly 100 industry professionals, community college representatives and elected officials, the symposium is the major annual event dedicated to developing biotechnology researchers in California.
</p><p>The symposium will also feature expert panels of scientists, engineers and journalists addressing healthcare solutions for the developing world, public understanding of human DNA analysis, and the commercialization of life-science innovations. CSU scholars will also discuss innovative research on using databases to discover new drugs, biogeochemistry and cellular physiology, and insulin production in pancreatic cells.
</p><p>Networking sessions for students and workshops for faculty are also on the agenda.
</p><p>It is sponsored by the CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB), which serves as the CSU’s primary liaison to industry and academic partners in the realm.
</p><p>According to CSU Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic Officer Ephraim P. Smith, “Each year, the CSU Biotechnology Symposium showcases the research of hundreds of students working toward high-demand science, technology, engineering and math degrees. Biotechnology and other knowledge-based industries represent the future of California's economic growth. CSUPERB's symposium helps to advance well-educated individuals who are critical to this workforce.”
</p><p>CSUPERB Executive Director Susan Baxter said the interface with industry speakers and expert panelists allows faculty-student teams to “stay connected to the grand challenges.”
</p><p>Said Baxter: “They can see how discoveries they’ve made in the laboratory might lead to a new vaccines for childhood diseases or how applied projects might lead to improvements in bioenergy production,” Baxter said. “For many of the students, the symposium marks their first research presentation to the broader scientific community. That’s a major milestone – somewhere between their first science fair and a job as a scientist or engineer or a future PhD.”
</p><p>According to the National Science Foundation, from 1997 to 2006, roughly 7,000 individuals with a bachelor's degree from CSU campuses went on to receive research-based doctoral degrees. (With the exception of recently announced nursing doctorates, the CSU itself does not award doctoral degrees in science.)

</p><p>A San Francisco art exhibit that invites spectators to take part by “dressing to transgress” features the work of CSU Monterey Bay faculty members.
</p><p>“<a href="http://www.somarts.org/glamorgeddonopens/">Glamorgeddon: The Spectacle</a>,” curated by Visual and Public Art Department professors Johanna Poethig, Dio Mendoza and Angelica Muro, is on display through Feb. 4 at the SOMArts Cultural Center.
</p><p>In Poethig’s words, the exhibit “celebrates how we choose to be fabulous, even as we critique the excesses of our own endangered species.”
</p><p>Poethig, a well&#45;known muralist and performance artist, has always been interested in the trappings of culture, media and advertising. “It was important for me to look more critically at product&#45;oriented culture and the ways media and the marketplace have placed a huge burden on us, especially women, to look and act a certain way,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle.
</p><p>Her own contribution to the show includes a series of bedazzled hard hats, which are available for spectators to pose with.
</p><p>The show features the work of more than 20 artists, including Dr. Amalia Mesa&#45;Bains, professor emerita at CSUMB and former chair of the Visual and Public Art Department. All works explore the concept of “glamour” via visual art, mixed media and performance.
</p><p>A series of <a href="http://www.somarts.org/limolectures/">30&#45;minute lectures</a> with some of the artists and scholars will be held on Jan. 30 – in a hot pink limousine.
</p><p>The <a href="http://www.somarts.org">SOMArts Cultural Center</a> is located at 934 Brannan St., between Eighth and Ninth streets, in San Francisco. The exhibit will close on Feb. 4.  Alumni John Elliott, Stephanie Sumler, Rachell Hester and Matt Florianni helped with the exhibit.

</p><p>It was about an 80-minute walk for Jose Hernandez from his home to his middle school in the village near San Luis Potosi, Mexico. . . . Hernandez traveled more than 1,800 miles from his hometown to Salinas, but even further on his educational road. He was named the Hearst Scholar at CSUMB, one of the top honors for students in the CSU system. – <em>Monterey Herald,</em> Oct. 9, 2012
</p><h3>Glass, Plastic, Paper, Oh My</h3><p>Glass, plastic containers, paper and aluminum cans – they all have their place at CSU Monterey Bay. And it’s not in trash cans.
</p><p>Campus recycling efforts got a big boost in the fall of 2009, when each room in the residence halls and all East Campus apartments were equipped with bright blue recycling bins – 3,100 in all. That’s about the time the university’s custodial contract was updated to include emptying of employees’ desk-side recycling bins.
</p><p>This year, CSUMB is measuring itself against other universities when it comes to recycling. As part of a commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, the university is making its first competitive appearance in the annual RecycleMania competition. (It participated last year, but in the non-competitive benchmark division.)
</p><p>RecycleMania is a nationwide, friendly student-led competition that pits colleges and universities in a contest to see which can reduce, reuse and recycle the most campus waste. It offers bragging rights and special awards made out of recycled materials to the winning schools.
</p><p>During last year’s 10-week competition, more than 600 campuses collectively recycled or composted over 84.5 million pounds. The 2011 installment officially runs for eight weeks between Feb. 6 and April 2. Leading up to the main event, colleges participated in two weeks of non-binding “trials” that began Jan. 24.
</p><p>This year, 630 schools – representing six million students – are registered, 391 in the competitive division, 239 in the benchmark division.
</p><p>Throughout the 10 weeks, CSUMB will report its recycling and trash weights and be ranked on RecycleMania’s results page. With each week’s reports and rankings, CSUMB can watch how its program stacks up against its competitors. As results fluctuate, the campus community will make a concerted effort to reduce and recycle even more. The first results should be posted on Feb. 18.
</p><p>"Our goal is to spread more awareness of recycling, to build our own campus recycling program and to reduce our carbon footprint," said Associated Students Environmental Affairs Senator Duane Lindsay.
</p><p>"We want to prove that we truly are a sustainable campus."
</p><p>The Environmental Affairs committee has established a group called the Green Team that will handle the recycling efforts and tabulate the weekly results. The Green Team also plans to work to make campus events such as homecoming and commencement zero waste. And it intends to hold random “awareness walks” around campus, where students spotted recycling – “caught green-handed” – will be given prizes.
</p><p>For more information, visit the RecycleMania website or CSUMB's <a href="http://ideals.csumb.edu/news/students-work-make-university-green">webpage</a>. To view the weekly results compiled by residence hall, check the display cases in front of the Otter Express.  
</p><h2>Convenience, savings with free rides</h2><h4>CSUMB username serves as transit pass on all MST routes</h4><p>It’s really a free ride.
</p><p>Starting Jan. 15, Cal State Monterey Bay students enrolled in the spring semester, as well as faculty and staff members, will be able to ride all Monterey-Salinas Transit buses for free.
</p><p>The UPASS program makes taking the bus more convenient than ever. No more fumbling for exact change – Otter identification card holders can just flash their IDs to the bus driver and take a seat.
</p><p>Using the free service to get around can eliminate the costs of driving a car – gas, insurance, parking fee and tickets, vehicle maintenance – for an annual savings of $9,600, according to a national survey released this month by the American Public Transportation Association.
</p><p>In addition to the convenience and money savings, using public transit spares the air from unhealthy pollutants. And if the closest transit stop is a bit far to walk, people can consider rolling there on a bike, skateboard or roller stakes.
</p><p>MST lines 16 and 25 (the Otter Trolley) stop at 24 locations on main and east campus. Both lines go through campus every hour in each direction, and can be used for on-campus shuttling as well as to reach destinations in Seaside, Marina and Salinas. Until now, riders were able to board on campus for free, but had to pay the return fare.
</p><p>Now, CSUMB username card holders can use those routes, as well as take the bus to Big Sur, Carmel, South Monterey County, and as far north as San Jose – all for free.
</p><p>The 2011 MST Rider’s Guide contains maps and schedules for all routes and is available at the Student Center, in Suite A of Mountain Hall, and online at <a href="http://www.mst.org" title="www.mst.org">www.mst.org</a> and csumb.edu/trip.
</p><p>Fifty-three students from Rolling Hills Middle School in Watsonville voluntarily spent their last week of winter break studying algebra – and having fun.
</p><p>The Algebra Academy was held at the headquarters of Graniterock in Watsonville from Jan. 3 through 6. On Friday of that week, the youngsters spent the day on the campus of California State University, Monterey Bay, then returned to Graniterock for a graduation ceremony on Saturday, where they received certificates.
</p><p>CSUMB math professors Hongde Hu and Lorraine O’Shea, assisted by four university students, taught the classes.
</p><p>Dr. Hu said he designed the program to get students up to speed with standards recently adopted by the California Department of Education that mandate preparation in algebra.
</p><p>“The academy is also intended to build a strong math foundation through hands-on activities with algebra applications in the real world,” he added.
</p><p>Among the problems they worked on: figuring out the odds of winning the state lottery and determining why California license plates need three letters.
</p><p>At CSUMB on Friday, the middle school students spent time in a math classroom where they played a game called “Survivor: Math Camp” that called on the skills they learned earlier in the week. One of the problems –10-5 (2-3) = ? – stumped all but three of them. The answer: 15.
</p><p>They also got a tour of campus, had lunch in the dining hall and learned what they have to do to prepare for college.
</p><p>Rollling Hills principal Rick Ito appreciated the opportunity for his students to participate in the program.
</p><p>“I think the important thing is that students have seen math in a different way. They have seen how math can affect very aspect of their lives,” he said. “It’s not just in a classroom. It’s all around us.”
</p><p>Ito also complimented the work of the four CSUMB students.
</p><p>“The teaching assistants have really made a connection with the students. They’re a bridge between the professors and the youngsters.
</p><p>“The CSUMB students have done a great job.”
</p><p>Graniterock CEO Bruce Woolpert and assistant general counsel Kevin Jeffery spearheaded the academy. The company has worked with Rolling Hills for four years, sending tutors from the company to help with English, art, math and science as well as hosting events such as awards ceremonies for students who get good grades.
</p><p>The students worked with tablet PCs provided by HP as part of a grant it recently awarded the university. CSUMB’s “Leapfrogging Mathematics in the Early Start Program” was one of only 10 applications that earned an EdTech Innovators Award from HP and the New Media Consortium. The award recognizes pioneers in education who are using technology in groundbreaking ways.
</p><p>According to HP, “Leapfrogging Math” stood out because it’s a proven example of an educational project that uses technology in novel ways inside and outside the classroom.
</p><p>The program’s goals are to reduce the percentage of college freshmen who need remedial math from 60 to under 40 percent; to help high school teachers invigorate their courses and collaborate with college professors on curriculum; and to document the work so that it can be used on campuses across the country.
</p><p>Working with HP, the university has created a remedial math program that serves about 500 of its own freshmen each year. More than 92 percent of students are passing the two-semester course, compared to the national rate of just under 50 percent.

</p><h4>CSUMB wins HP award
	Math program selected as one of 10 exemplary projects worldwide</h4><p>Cal State Monterey Bay has earned an EdTech Innovators Award from Hewlett Packard and the New Media Consortium. The award recognizes pioneers in education who are using technology in groundbreaking ways.
</p><p>According to HP, CSUMB’s project, “Leapfrogging Mathematics in the Early Start Program,” stood out because it’s a proven example of an educational project that uses technology in novel ways inside and outside the classroom. The EdTech Innovators Award includes a technology grant of $40,000 and membership in a social network designed for educators. Only 10 winners were selected – 4 percent of applications – representing educational institutions in the U.S., India, Costa Rica, South Africa, Canada and Brazil. The new grant allows high school math teachers and students to attend four weeks of math “boot camp” during the summer. The high school teachers will partner with CSUMB faculty members on new educational strategies using tablet PCs – personal computers equipped with touch screens – that address the needs of remedial math students. The project’s goals are to reduce the percentage of college freshmen who need remedial math from 60 percent to under 40 percent; to help high school teachers invigorate their courses and collaborate with college professors on curriculum; and to document the work so that it can be used on campuses across the country. Leapfrogging Math is a new program, but it builds on CSUMB’s successes in courses using tablet PC technology. Working with HP, the university has created a remedial math program that serves about 500 of its own freshmen each year. More than 92 percent of students are passing the two-semester course, compared to the national rate of just under 50 percent. In recognition of the university’s innovative work to integrate mobile technologies across the curriculum, HP has awarded four technology grants to CSUMB’s Wireless Education and Technology Center since 2003.  
</p><p><em>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison sent this message to the campus community on Tuesday, Jan. 11:</em>
</p><p>In his proposed 2011-2012 state budget, introduced on Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown asks the Legislature to cut $500 million from the CSU’s system-wide budget and an equal amount from the University of California system, as well as $400 million from community colleges. That is $1.4 billion less for higher education, out of a total $12.4 billion in spending cuts recommended by the governor. He proposes no new cuts in K-12 education. The CSU faces an 18 percent loss in state funding, taking the system back to 1999-2000 levels, even though it now serves nearly 70,000 more students. This would undo progress the CSU made this fiscal year in restoring funding lost in the previous two years. Even worse, the $500 million is a “best-case” scenario that hinges on voter approval this spring to extend temporary tax increases. Our staff, faculty, students, parents, and many community friends are understandably anxious to know what this will specifically mean for California State University, Monterey Bay. It is still too early to say, though I pledge to keep all of our stakeholders as informed as possible in the months ahead. I should have a better idea how the proposed budget would affect our campus by late January or early February. We will need everyone’s support and understanding as we make tough decisions. Clearly, we will have to manage our way through a very difficult period that could easily extend beyond next year. Having tightened our belt through several budget cycles, we are already about as lean and efficient as we can get. We have left positions vacant, slashed spending on repairs, maintenance and equipment, restricted travel, and streamlined departments. I and my campus colleagues will do all we can to preserve and protect instruction and support services to our students. Gov. Brown’s budget proposal will not affect enrollment this spring, but the CSU, including Monterey Bay, will likely admit fewer students for Fall 2011. In terms of financial aid, students who are receiving Pell Grants should not experience any change, and we do not anticipate any rollback in state university grants. With regard to other steps necessary to achieve the needed reductions in spending, everything remains on the table. I will be meeting with our Senior Leadership Team to develop alternatives that prepare us for whatever emerges in the final state budget and CSU plan. We will keep the best interests of our students and the entire university in mind as we weigh our options. Sincerely, Dianne F. Harrison, Ph.D. President  
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s Master of Social Work program is accepting applications for Fall 2011. Application deadline is Jan. 31
</p><p>The program provides an opportunity for people who are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is both accessible and affordable. It is intended to address a chronic shortage of professionally trained social workers in the tri-county area, especially those who are bilingual and bicultural.
</p><p>Classes are small and personal, and are offered in the evenings. The three-year program allows students to concentrate in either Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year.
</p><p>For more information, contact Vivienne Orgel at 582-5315. Admission requirements and application materials are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/msw">here</a>.
</p><p>An information session to learn more about the program is scheduled for Jan. 20, noon to 1 p.m. in Beach Hall. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>Last fall's inaugural class numbered 41 students. Ninety-five percent of them come from Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties; 10 percent are employed by one of those counties; most are female; and 40 percent are bilingual.  Nearly 70 percent earned a bachelor's degree in the last five years and nearly 60 percent are under the age of 30.

</p><p>In a large conference room at Graniterock's headquarters in Watsonville, 54 Rolling Hills Middle School students are voluntarily spending a week of their winter break studying algebra and to the casual observer, they're having fun. Taught by a team of mathematics professors and students from CSUMB, the Algebra Academy give the students six hours per day of math instruction in what organizers hope is a relaxed atmosphere without the threat of quizzes looming over their heads.  — <em>Watsonville Register-Pajaronian</em>, Jan. 6, 2011
</p><p>Renee Jimenez didn't actively recruit the best players in teh off-season. Instead she went after players that played on the best teams. "I hate to lose," said the CSUMB women's coach. "These kids come from prgrams that are accustomed to winning." And it shows. While gaining nationwide respect has been slow, the Otter's record-breaking start continues after rolling to a 71-41 win Friday over visiting Cal State, Los Angeles. -The Herald, Jan. 8, 2011
</p><p>If money is a problem for prospective students seeking a special education teaching credential n the local university, government money can be the answer. CSUMB's teacher education program received a federal grant to help students prepare for a career teaching students with disabilities.   -The Californian, Jan. 12, 2011

</p><p>To most sports teams, a new year falls somewhere between rebuilding and reloading. For the baseball team at Cal State Monterey Bay, it is a matter of reinventing. First-year coach Walt White has began his time in Seaside with hopes to make the Otters a force in the CCAA. — <em>Salinas Californian</em>, Jan. 17, 2011
</p><h3>Watch the Otters online</h3><p>The Internet has sparked an evolution in college sports viewing, and CSUMB has picked up on the trend.
</p><p>Colleges and universities nationwide are increasingly video-streaming their sporting events on their websites. It’s a way to broaden fan support for schools whose games are not televised and make games available to family and alumni living outside the region.
</p><p>At CSUMB, all home basketball and volleyball games are broadcast online. To find the broadcast, visit otherathletics.com and click on the “live audio/video/stats” tab on the right-hand side.
</p><p>While soccer, baseball and softball games are not broadcast, live, play-by-play statistics are available online at the same web address.
</p><p>It’s also possible to follow the Otters on the road. Live stats of men’s and women’s basketball and volleyball games have been mandated by the California Collegiate Athletic Association and are available via the CCAA Network at <a href="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx" title="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx">http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx</a>.
</p><p>In addition, some schools – such as Sonoma State, Cal State Stanislaus and Cal State L.A. – provide video streaming of their home games. Broadcasts can be accessed via the CCAA Network.
</p><p>The Jan. 28 women’s basketball game at home to Cal Poly Pomona is a good time to check out the streaming video. The Otters lead the CCAA with a 12-0 conference record. Tip-off is 5:30 p.m.
</p><p>Part of what's driving the trend is that the Internet has increasingly become the main communication tool in college athletics.
</p><p>That also creates new opportunity for smaller schools.
</p><p>"We don't get the media exposure that the Division I schools get. We're not on TV. This is our opportunity to get our exposure and develop our fan base," said Mindy Mills, CSUMB’s sports information director. "This helps us get more exposure outside the boundaries of our campus."
</p><p>For those who prefer more traditional media, all Otter men's basketball games – home and away – are broadcast on KION 1460 AM in the Monterey Bay area.  
</p><h3>Open house scheduled for Jan. 27 at CSUMB</h3><p>California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to learn more about the master’s degree program in Instructional Science and Technology at an open house on Jan. 27.
</p><p>The event will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center on Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Several current students and graduates of the program will share their experience and how they are applying the skills they acquired to their current work.
</p><p>The 16-month program will start in August. Application deadline is March 15.
</p><p>The Master’s in Instructional Science and Technology program prepares students for positions in the fast-changing fields of modern education and training. The hybrid learning experience – which integrates several days on campus at the beginning of each semester with online classes – enables graduates to advance in their current careers and will position them to assume leadership roles in education and training.
</p><p>Successful educators and e-learning developers in the knowledge-based, global economy require command of all the technological tools and methodologies available to them; the MIST program is designed to provide students with those skills.
</p><p>More information about the MIST program is available at csumb.edu/mist, by calling the School of School of Computing and Design at 582-4741, or by e-mailing <a href="m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;c&#115;&#117;&#109;&#98;&#46;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">mist@csumb.edu</a>.

</p><h2>Instructor contributes to book from Harvard Press</h2><p>Once in a great while, as The New York Times noted recently, a naturalist writes a book that changes the way people look at the living world. John James Audubon's "Birds of America," published in 1838, was one. Roger Tory Peterson's 1934 "Field Guide to the Birds" was another.
</p><p>Add another title to that list.
</p><p>"Field Notes on Science and Nature," published in 2011 by Harvard University Press, allows readers to peer over the shoulders and into the notebooks of a dozen researchers, to study first-hand their observational methods, materials and fleeting impressions.
</p><p>"Field Notes" offers specific examples that professional naturalists can emulate to fine-tune their own field methods, along with practical advice that amateur naturalists and students can use to document their adventures.
</p><p>Some of that practical advice comes from Jenny Keller, an instructor in the Science Illustration program at CSU Monterey Bay, who contributed a chapter and the cover illustration. Her chapter is titled “Why Sketch?” In it, she encourages scientists to give it a try, and offers some basic drawing instruction. “I’m trying to make the case that it’s doable and here’s how,” she said. “It’s not that hard to add some simple visuals to your field observations, and it will deepen the amount of information your field notes can capture. The drawings will be able to say things that are hard to capture in words. “Careful observation makes you a better scientist, and drawing is a great way to observe,” Keller said. The project started several years ago when the book’s editor, Michael Canfield, contacted Keller out of the blue. “I don’t know how he found me, but we talked animatedly for about 90 minutes, and then we realized that we wanted to work together on the project,” she said. “I’m honored to be in the company of these naturalists. Some of my biggest heroes are contributors to this book,” she said. Keller came to CSUMB when the science illustration program moved to the university from its original home at UC Santa Cruz Extension in the fall of 2009. She teaches field sketching, applied techniques in natural science illustration, zoological illustration and history of scientific illustration. She combined her lifelong interests in art and science when she began keeping illustrated field journals in 1981. Since that time, sketching natural subjects from life has continued to inspire and inform her other illustration projects, which have centered on mammals, birds, and botanical subject matter. Her work has appeared in numerous books, magazine and other publications. In 1992, “Dolphin Days,” a book she illustrated, won the John Burroughs Award for best book of the year in natural history. More information on the science illustration program at CSUMB is available <a href="http://scienceillustration.org">here</a>.

</p><p>To celebrate Black History Month, California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to a free musical performance by the group Voices of Freedom.
</p><p>The hourlong concert will be held at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 8, in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue, near the intersection with Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>Oakland-based Voices of Freedom is comprised of members of church choirs, students and faculty at several Bay Area colleges as well as members of the community.
</p><p>The program, “Get Your Shout On,” will include ancient Yoruba chants from West Africa, and will demonstrate how Negro spirituals derived from those chants. The program will end with a re-creation of a ring-shout, a feature of the “invisible” church of enslaved Africans and their American-born descendants. Singing, dancing and percussion are involved; the audience will be invited to participate.
</p><p>The choir is accompanied by a battery of batá (sacred) drums, led by master drummer Otobaji Stewart. Voices of Freedom’s founder and executive director Wanda Ravernell – a former editor and writer at the San Francisco Chronicle – will provide historical and spiritual context for the music.

The studies – which represent 20 campuses and the CSU’s Moss Landing Marine Laboratory – focus on topics that include invasive species, unseen internal waves, sustainable seafood, marine-protection areas, environmental contaminants, ocean acidification, gene-tracking in the sea, and ripple patterns in submerged sand.
</p><p>CSUMB undergraduates Alexandra Davis, Craig Mueller, Todd Hallenbeck, Julia Carrillo and Jocelyne Gomez worked with faculty mentor Rikk Kvitek. The abstract for their project describes it this way:
</p><p>"The California Seafloor Mapping Project (CSMP) is a cooperative initiative creating a comprehensive, high-resolution coastal/marine geologic and habitat base map for all of California’s state waters. This 8500 km2 dataset is enabling researchers to study patterns and distribution of near-shore habitats at scales never before possible, including the presence of rippled scour depressions (RSD) as the most prominent feature on the continental shelf . . . . The goal is to use autoclassification methods to quantify the extent and distribution of three benthic habitats (rock, sediment, RSD) within state waters . . . results are used to quantify and characterize patterns in the distribution and abundance of these habitats along the California continental margin."
</p><p>The purpose of the event is to provide a measure of the excellence and relevance of marine and coastal research conducted within the CSU system. For more about COAST, visit <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/coast" title="www.calstate.edu/coast">www.calstate.edu/coast</a>.  
</p><p> 
</p><p>A pair of CSUMB undergraduates and four students from Seaside High School have teamed up on a project they hope will help to clean up the local environment.
</p><p>A 10-minute documentary-style film, “Litter: A Community Problem That Needs Community Solutions,” is the result of their collaboration.
</p><p>It was shown at an event in Salinas on Jan. 26, sponsored by Sustainable Monterey County.
</p><p>Stephen Richmond and Stefanie Kortman got involved with the project as a way to satisfy the requirements of Professor Suzie Worcester’s Interpreting Monterey Bay Natural History service learning class. The two selected litter as the topic they wanted to pursue after hearing a presentation by a local environmental educator.
</p><p>Because Professor Worcester’s classes had worked with Seaside High in the past, they approached biology teacher Julie Haws. She was eager to have her students participate. As a result, Jasmine Spears, Dania Blanco, Susan Le and Alondra Ortiz worked with Richmond and Kortman, narrating the film and setting its direction.
</p><p>The film focuses on litter issues in Marina and includes interviews with local leaders and community residents to demonstrate how it affects the environment. The student team filmed areas of the city where litter is a real problem, making sure to clean it up before moving on to the next location.
</p><p>Haws said the opportunity for her students to participate in the project is beneficial in several ways.
</p><p>“It’s amazing that these college students, who aren’t much older than my students, are mentoring them and encouraging them to go to college,” Haws told the Monterey Herald. “It also helps my students connect with a sense of place, and the problems we have that affect us not just here but globally.”  
</p><p>Kevin Johnson took a top honor at the inaugural Emerging Researchers National Conference in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, held Feb. 24 and 25 in Washington, D.C.
</p><p>A biology major, Johnson won first place in the Ecology, Environmental and Earth Sciences division for his poster presentation.
</p><p>He summarized research he started last summer, when he worked with graduate student Erin Stanfield. The project began as an internship with the Santa Cruz Water Department, a position that was arranged through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center at CSU Monterey Bay and funded by the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.
</p><p>His research involves observing what types of cyanobacteria – a blue-green algae – are present in Loch Lomond and Pinto Lake, and whether or not they have the potential to produce microcystin, a liver toxin that has been linked to sea otter deaths in Monterey Bay. The World Health Organization has set limits on the amount of microcystin in sources of recreational and drinking water.
</p><p>“We are looking at Pinto Lake in Watsonville because it’s a recreational body of water that has produced large blooms of cyanobacteria. And we’re looking at Loch Lomond because it’s the source of drinking water for Santa Cruz,” Johnson said. “We’re using both environmental and molecular lab techniques in order to identify potential toxicity at each lake.
</p><p>“This research will inform water management agencies in Watsonville and Santa Cruz regarding water quality,” Johnson said.
</p><p>The conference was designed to help students enhance their science communication skills, better understand how to prepare for science careers in a global workforce, and to find out about summer, graduate school, and employment opportunities. It was co-sponsored by American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Science Foundation and aimed at students who participate in programs funded by the NSF. His travel expenses, registration fees and hotel were covered by the AAAS.
</p><p>"This is a great example of how research mentoring can propel our students to academic and research excellence," said Dr. Bill Head, director of UROC. 
</p><p>The junior from San Benito County has had experience talking about his work. He was selected to attend the CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) conference in early January, where he also made a poster presentation.

</p><h3>Kim Weston kicks off Visiting Artist series</h3><p>Kim Weston, artist and grandson of photographer Edward Weston, will kick off the spring visiting artists lecture series at CSU Monterey Bay on February 17, 2011.
</p><p>The event will be held in the University Center living room starting with a reception at 6 p.m. The talk will follow at 6:30. The public is invited to attend this free event.
</p><p>“Growing Up Weston” is the title of his illustrated lecture. Kim’s talk will reveal insights into three generations of one of the most important and creative families in photography.
</p><p>He learned his craft assisting his father Cole in the darkroom, making gallery prints from his grandfather Edward's original negatives. Kim also worked for many years as an assistant to his uncle Brett, whose bold, abstract photographs rank as some of the finest examples of modern photographic art.
</p><p>Together, the Westons’ work has made the Monterey Peninsula an important locale in American visual culture, like Ansel Adams’ Yosemite or Georgia O’Keefe’s New Mexico.
</p><p>While being trained by his father, Kim learned that the reward was in the process of the prints, not just in the final image.
</p><p>Reminiscing about the days when he was an assistant to his uncle, Kim said, “My uncle used to say a great thing. When he would show his work, people would ask him to interpret it, and he would simply say, ‘The photograph speaks for itself.’ That is all he would ever say of his art.”
</p><p>Kim has been a fine art photographer for 30 years, specializing in large format photography. His main body of work consists of silver contact prints made from 8x10 negatives. He also photographs with a Mamiya 67 that he inherited from his father. Lately, he has added paint to his photographs.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>Other artists scheduled to visit this semester are printmakers Imin Yeh on March 3 and Nancy Hom on April 7, 2011.
</p><h2>Grand slam</h2><h3>Saul Williams kicks off Black History Month at CSUMB</h3><p>In celebration of Black History Month, spoken-word artist Saul Williams will perform at CSU Monterey at 7 p.m., Feb. 1, in the University Center ballroom.
</p><p>Williams has been called a “new-age hip-hop renaissance man” by the Fresno Bee. Esquire magazine called him the “Bob Marley of American poets.”
</p><p>He’s a slam poet, author, actor and a musician who raps and plays guitar. To young people across the country, he has defined poetry as an accessible, living art form; many view him as the catalyst for the spoken word movement and the advent of poetry slams.
</p><p>After graduating from Morehouse College with a bachelor’s degree in acting and philosophy, Williams moved to New York City to earn a master's degree in acting at New York University. There, he found himself at the center of the New York cafe poetry scene.
</p><p>He landed the lead role in the 1998 film Slam. Williams served as both a writer and actor on the film, which won the Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize and the Camera D'Or prize at Cannes and introduced him to international audiences.
</p><p>He’s written three collections of poetry and has been published in the New York Times, Esquire and African Voices. His newest book, “The Dead Emcee Scrolls: The Lost Teachings of Hip-Hop,” recounts the history of that genre. As a poet and musician, Williams has toured and lectured around the world, appearing at many universities and colleges.
</p><p>Admission is $5 and tickets can be purchased at the door. A $2 parking pass must be purchased as well. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h3>Feb. 22 talk marks eating disorders awareness week</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay will mark National Eating Disorders Awareness Week with a presentation by author, speaker and yoga therapist Brie Mathers. The free event will take place at 7 p.m., Feb. 22, in the University Center living room. The public is invited. Mathers’ topic is “Love the Skin You’re In – Taking out the Social Programming that Rules our Self-Images and Pocketbooks.” She’ll share the story of her near-miss Olympic dream due to anorexia and her healing, which inspired a passionate speaking campaign and online recovery program. After the presentation, Mathers (pictured at left) will be available for questions and will sign copies of her book, “Freedom to Blossom – An Invitation to Shine.” The National Eating Disorders Association has proclaimed Feb. 20-26 as the 24th annual week set aside to talk about eating disorders and unrealistic body-perfect ideals, and to fight for more research, support and access to treatment for people suffering from these life-threatening illnesses. Through NED Awareness Week, the national non-profit group seeks to educate the public on signs and symptoms of eating disorders and encourage people to get help. The goal is also to spread a message of hope: Help is available, recovery is possible and those affected are not alone in their struggle. According to the group’s website, <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:">www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:</a> • Nearly 10 million females and 1 million males in the U.S. are battling eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, while millions more suffer from binge eating disorder.
</p><p>• The peak onset of eating disorders occurs during puberty and the late teen/early adult years, but symptoms can occur as young as kindergarten.
</p><p>• More than one in three normal dieters progresses to pathological dieting.
</p><p>CSUMB’s Personal Growth and Counseling Center is sponsoring the event in collaboration with the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development, Student Housing and Residential Life, and the athletic department. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h2>Renowned school reformer Diane Ravitch has changed her mind</h2><h3>Federal testing has narrowed education and charter schools have failed to live up to their promise, she says</h3><p>The President’s Speaker Series at CSU Monterey Bay resumes Feb. 23 when prominent education scholar Diane Ravitch visits campus. Her talk will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>Her topic: Will Education Reform Improve Our Schools? She will use her best-selling book, The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education, as the foundation for a discussion on the critical state of education reform in our nation.
</p><p>Dr. Ravitch is research professor of education at New York University; a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. From 1991 through 1993, she was assistant secretary of education in the administration of President George H.W. Bush, where she led the federal effort to promote the creation of state and national academic standards.
</p><p>A former proponent of the No Child Left Behind Act, Dr. Ravitch later became disillusioned by the test score-based philosophy and has become one of its most vocal critics. “We are judging students by these test scores. They are not telling us how much students are learning. They are telling us how much students have been prepped,” Ravitch has said. In the book, she critiques the punitive uses of accountability to fire teachers and close schools, as well as replacing public schools with charter schools and relying on superstar teachers.
</p><p>“We should have a long-term plan in which we improve the quality of the teaching force, have higher educational expectations for those who come into teaching. We should begin to think about an improved profession, better assessments and insisting on this vision of education in which kids get a broad, rich and coherent curriculum, rather than basic skills only,” she said in her latest book.
</p><p>Dr. Ravitch shares a blog called Bridging Differences with Deborah Meier, hosted by Education Week. She also blogs for politico.com/arena and the Huffington Post. Her articles have appeared in many newspapers and magazines.
</p><p>The lecture is free. Reservations are recommended and can be made online by clicking <a href="http://rsvp.csumb.edu/index.php?eid=70">here</a>. For more information, or to request disability accommodations, call (831) 582-4580.

</p><h3>A scuba beauty pageant?</h3><p>“Saltwater runs through my veins,” said Chanel Hason, a 2010 graduate of the <a href="http://catalog.csumb.edu/undergrad-education/majors/environmental-science-technology-policy">Environmental Science, Technology and Policy</a> program.
</p><p>That’s why the idea of vying for the title of Miss Scuba International 2013 – a competition devoted to protecting the oceans – appeals to her. She will represent the United States in the pageant on Dec. 20 in Malaysia.
</p><p>You’ve never heard of the competition? That may be because it’s only two years old and was founded by the owner of several diving resorts in Malaysia.
</p><p>“It’s huge in the Asian countries,” Hason said, “but hasn’t picked up speed yet in the U.S.”
</p><p>She doesn’t see herself as a typical beauty queen. Instead, she said, “I’m a marine conservationist, scuba diver, educator and environmentalist, and I’m ready to win the Miss Scuba International Pageant!”
</p><p>Hason said the contestants are judged on talent. She’s showcasing her skills as a photographer “to get people excited about how beautiful our planet is, not only above water but below the water as well.”
</p><p>Contestants will also be judged on their diving skills, knowledge of scuba tourism and marine conservation, communications, work ethic, and proficiency in a question-and-answer session.
</p><p>“We’ll be tested on how we assemble our gear, and given a list of skills to demonstrate underwater,” she said. That shouldn’t present a problem for Hason, who has been a certified diver since 2006, and earned advanced and rescue certifications while at CSUMB.
</p><p>The 25-year-old resident of Los Angeles said her love of the ocean began on a trip to Sea World when she was 5. Her interest in marine science brought her to CSUMB; while a student, she spent three years as a volunteer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and studied in Australia for a year, conducting research on the Great Barrier Reef.
</p><p>She’ll be in Malaysia for two weeks, scuba diving and participating in conservation efforts that include releasing baby sea turtles and cleaning beaches.
</p><p>The pageant winner, according to the Miss Scuba website, “will undertake a year of ocean conservation campaigns to educate and inspire the desire in all of us to do our best to safeguard our oceans. The pageant will also offer her a unique and comprehensive platform to launch her career and personal development.”
</p><p>Hason embraces the idea and hopes this will lead to her dream job somewhere in the ecotourism industry.
</p><p>“I love interacting with people and being outdoors,” she said. “I belong on a beach in a wetsuit, not behind a desk.
</p><p>“My purpose in life is to educate as many people as possible about ways to protect our planet, and this opportunity with the pageant seemed like a step in the right direction,” she said.

</p><p>The San Jose-Silicon Valley Chapter of the California Society of Certified Public Accountants has awarded scholarships to a pair of CSU Monterey Bay students.
</p><p>Paul Fuller, a senior, and John McGoldrick, a junior, were presented CalCPA scholarships at an event on Jan. 26. Both are business students in the accounting concentration. They were selected as the organization’s outstanding 2011 senior and junior students, respectively.
</p><p>As the outstanding senior, Fuller's name will be engraved on the CalCPA scholarship recipient plaque on display in the office of CSUMB's School of Business.
</p><p>Students from Cabrillo and Gavilan colleges, Monterey Peninsula College, UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State and Santa Clara universities also received scholarships and were honored that night.
</p><p>The scholarship recipients also receive a one-year student membership in the organization.
</p><p>“I could sense the pride of the professional membership to see so many well dressed, aspiring accountants from so many colleges,” Fuller said. “Even after the event ended, many members stayed to congratulate and thank the students.”
</p><p>The California Society of Certified Public Accountants is the nation’s largest statewide association of CPAs. Founded in 1909, CalCPA represents over 34,000 members.

</p><h3>Weather, surf conditions delay launch until May</h3><p>Students in Dr. Steve Moore’s underwater robotics class in the fall of 2010 didn’t kick back over the winter break last January.
</p><p>Instead, they volunteered to continue working on a project that wasn’t quite finished when the semester ended. The work – some of which took place in Professor Moore’s cluttered garage amid tools, electronic and mechanical parts and testing equipment – extended into the spring semester.
</p><p>The class was working on SurfBot – an 8-foot Styrofoam surfboard to which two boogie boards and a pair of propellers are attached, as well as a metal box containing cameras, batteries, computers and electronics. Riding atop it all is a small stuffed otter, CSU Monterey Bay’s mascot.
</p><p>After several surf- and weather-related delays, SurfBot was finally launched on May 8. It successfully completed its (revised) mission – to seek out and find a sunken sailboat and amphibious vehicle in approximately 27 feet of water off Del Monte Beach in Monterey.
</p><p>"In spite of its name, it's not designed to surf," Dr. Moore said. "But it's the only surfboard I know that can swim and navigate all by itself!"
</p><p>SurfBot finds its way with the help of a GPS unit and a pair of tiny computers. A video camera mounted on the robot beams live images back to shore. If the robot gets into trouble, the students can override its automatic navigation and use remote control to steer it from shore. If that fails, students would use a kayak to rescue the bot. After all, it's worth about $3,000.
</p><p>The challenge given to the students was to build a robot that could map the depth and contours of the upper Carmel Submarine Canyon, a side branch of the famous Monterey Canyon.
</p><p>But, according to Dr. Moore, "that was just an excuse to make learning more fun and effective." Carmel Canyon has already been mapped accurately by CSUMB's Seafloor Mapping Lab, which uses much more sophisticated technology to do the job. Dr. Moore planned to use those maps to check the accuracy of the students' results and assign their grades accordingly.
</p><p>The 17 students in the class were mostly biology and environmental science, technology and policy students; one was studying computer science.
</p><p>Dr. Moore said that it’s unusual for biology students to take this kind of class. Normally, robotics this advanced would be taught in an engineering program.
</p><p>Alin Gonzlez, a biology major from San Francisco, was attracted to the class because she thinks it will help her as she continues her education.
</p><p>“I learned the basics of software,” she said. “I think I could do smaller projects on my own now, and that will help me do research in grad school.” She has applied to Texas A&amp;M’s Fisheries Management program.
</p><p>Cortland Jordan, an environmental science, technology and policy student from Lake Elsinore, was also attracted to the possibility of acquiring skills that will help him pursue a graduate degree in applied technology for ecology at Oregon State.
</p><p>“. . . Many of us want to do this kind of thing in graduate school. We got caught up in this project,” he said. “We were in the lab every Thursday night for four hours. We ate pizza and built robots.
</p><p>“The best part of this: In marine biology, it’s very competitive. This skill will give me a boost.”
</p><p>On Jan. 29, the students’ skills were put to the test as SurfBot was taken for a test drive at Moss Landing Harbor.
</p><p>“We got some valuable vehicle performance data and we learned some useful things that will improve the success of the mapping we hope to do when the weather and ocean conditions cooperate,” Dr. Moore said at the time.
</p><p>With the end of the spring semester looming, the right conditions still hadn't materialized. That resulted in a change of location and a revised mission.
</p><p>Dr. Moore joined the faculty even before the university opened its doors to students in the fall of 1995. He teaches an eclectic mix of biology, physics and nature photography courses and runs the Ecosystem Electronics Lab (EEL), the university’s own scientific research and development team.
</p><p>He and his students – including those in the robotics class – invent out of necessity, developing new research tools because they don’t yet exist or alternatives are cost-prohibitive. The result: usable technologies that allow scientists and students to better understand our world.
</p><p>And, maybe have some fun while “learning a bunch of stuff,” as Dr. Moore says. To learn more about the Science and Environmental Policy program, click <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/sep/">here</a>.

</p><p>CSUMB staff member Megan Tolbert received an Excellence Award from the Transportation Agency for Monterey County at its Jan. 26 meeting.
</p><p>Tolbert was among the outstanding individuals, projects and programs to be honored at the agency’s ninth annual awards presentation.
</p><p>The honorees “have shown exceptional hard work and dedication in improving transportation in Monterey County,” a statement on the agency’s website said.
</p><p>In conferring the honor, TAMC said: “Ms. Tolbert has been a strong advocate for alternative transportation in Monterey County. Not only has she been an asset to the Transportation Agency as a transportation planner for CSUMB, but her work with Monterey Green Action has been key to promoting the use of bicycles as a viable transportation alternative. She has taken a lead role in educating the public on the importance of rail projects in Monterey County.”
</p><p>Tolbert joined the university as a transportation planner in January 2010. After earning a degree in natural resources planning at Humboldt State in 2002, she has been working on the Monterey Peninsula as an environmental planner and sustainability advocate for governments, non-profits and private industry, including EMC Planning Group in Monterey, Monterey Green Action and the city of Monterey. 
</p><p>At the university, she develops and implements transportation management programs, including vanpools, ridesharing, public transit, shuttles, electric vehicle infrastructure and bicycle and pedestrian accessibility.

</p><p>Dick Bower, CSUMB’s emergency manager, has earned another credential to add to his considerable resume.
</p><p>The Center for Public Safety Excellence, a nonprofit organization that helps public safety agencies improve their services in a variety of ways, has awarded Bower the professional designation of fire marshal. He is now one of only 3,000 fire service professionals worldwide who hold this credential.
</p><p>The stringent process included an assessment of his education, experience, professional development, technical competencies, contributions to the profession and community involvement.
</p><p>Typically, fire marshals enforce fire codes, teach fire prevention and find the cause of destructive fires. While the designation isn’t directly related to his position at CSUMB, Bower said it had long been his professional goal to earn the credential, and many of the skills that earned him this recognition are used in his work at the university.
</p><p>Bower joined the university in late January with more than 27 years of experience in public service, including stints as a firefighter and emergency medical technician, fire marshal, fire chief, planning commissioner, building official and emergency manager.
</p><p>Most recently, he served as the building and fire safety director and emergency management director of Gig Harbor, Wash., a position he held for nine years.
</p><p>He earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Puget Sound and a master’s degree in disaster preparedness and executive fire service leadership from Grand Canyon University.
</p><p>In addition to certification as an emergency manager by the International Association of Emergency Managers and code official accreditation from the Washington Association of Building Officials, Bower holds numerous International Code Council certifications in building inspection and plan review.
</p><p>He is working with the university and surrounding communities to improve emergency preparedness at all levels.  
</p><h2>LGBTQI rights activist visits CSUMB</h2><h4>‘Transition: A Conversation with Chaz Bono’ sponsored by CAHSS</h4><p>Chaz Bono, the only child of entertainers Sonny and Cher, will visit California State University, Monterey Bay on March 9. The public is invited.
</p><p>The event will take the form of a conversation with the audience on physical and social gender transitions, and will include an opportunity for attendees to submit written questions.
</p><p>Bono is an advocate for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, queer and intersex people, an author and speaker. He came out publicly in 1995 in an interview with The Advocate, the national gay and lesbian news magazine. The decision to come out prompted his public work in support of LGBTQI rights and social justice.
</p><p>His latest book, “Transition: The Story of How I Became a Man,” due out in May, is his candid account of a 40-year struggle to match his gender identity with his physical body and his transformation from female to male.
</p><p>The story of that transition is also told in “Becoming Chaz,” a documentary screened in January at the Sundance Film Festival. It will air on the Oprah Winfrey Network later this year.
</p><p>The film depicts Bono’s emotional and physical transition, a journey of identity and self-discovery. Beyond hormone treatments and surgeries, the film walks moviegoers through Bono’s changing relationship with his mother, and with his partner, Jennifer Elia. He says he’s now infinitely happier and more fulfilled.
</p><p>“It’s the greatest thing I’ve ever done in my life. It’s the only time I’ve felt like a complete person,” he says in the film.
</p><p>Parts of his story are familiar to many. Three years ago, Chastity Bono began the process of changing genders. Bono was 39 at the time and had led a stormy life, battling addiction, the death of a partner, a coming-out process and the glare of the spotlight that began as an infant, in front of a national TV audience on “The Sonny and Cher Show.”
</p><p>Despite it all, “Most people will have much more in common with Chaz than they think,” filmmaker Randy Barbato told the Los Angeles Times in an interview at Sundance. “He’s kind of an average Joe.”
</p><p>The event is sponsored by CSUMB’s College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the campus Out and About club.
</p><p>WHAT: Transition: A Conversation with Chaz Bono WHEN: 7 p.m., March 9 WHERE: Ballroom of the University Center on Sixth Avenue COST: Free, no tickets or reservations required INFORMATION: Cheryl Abbott, 582-4189

</p><p>In December 1959, a revolution in comedy began in front of a small crowd in a former laundry building in Chicago.
</p><p>An improvisational group called Second City gave its first performance, satirizing the Eisenhower era.
</p><p>Since then millions of people have attended Second City shows or watched the group’s many alumni on television or in movies. It has been called the “Harvard of humor,” and among its former members are Alan Arkin, Joan Rivers, Bill Murray, John Belushi, Mike Myers, Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert.
</p><p>Local audiences will have the opportunity to experience Second City’s brand of comedy when the touring troupe gives a performance at California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater on March 3. Showtime is 7:30 p.m. The show is recommended for adult audiences.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the group will perform a show called Fair &amp; Unbalanced, which takes unbridled comic pleasure in the foibles of politicians, celebrities and even our significant others through sketch comedy, songs and on-the-spot improvisation.
</p><p>World Theater executive director Joe Cardinalli’s decision to book an improv comedy show was easy once he heard that Second City was available and touring the West Coast.
</p><p>“This is definitely an evening to enjoy and to laugh out loud,” Cardinalli said. “Everyone tells us that laughter is the best medicine, so come and enjoy a dose of laugher.”
</p><p>Unlike other forms of comedy, improv isn’t about the solo performer; it’s the ensemble that counts. Rarely is there a dramatic opening or musical fanfare, sometimes no scenery or props. Against a black backdrop are simple chairs and sometimes a piano.
</p><p>No institution escapes their satiric eye – from the blowhards of the Beltway to the Hollywood elite. It’s a ride through present day America.
</p><p>Since those early days, Second City has added a theater and training center in Toronto, training centers in Chicago and Hollywood, 11 full-time touring ensembles and television and film operations. But what brought national attention to the company was “Saturday Night Live.” The TV program’s original cast included three Second City alumni – Belushi, Dan Akroyd and Gilda Radner. Since then, more than two dozen performers and even more writers have made the move from Second City to SNL.
</p><p>Perhaps a future SNL cast member or TV star will be on stage when Second City performs at the World Theater.
</p><p>Tickets range from $10 to $40 and can be purchased <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">online</a> or by calling the box office at 582-4580. Driving directions and a campus map are available<a href="http://csumb.edu/map"> here</a>.
</p><p>Greg Fujii hit a walk-off double to lift the Cal State Monterey Bay baseball team to a 7-6 victory over Biola University in the Otters home opener on Thursday.
</p><p>CSUMB held a 6-5 lead entering the top of the ninth inning. A single, a walk and an error allowed the Eagles to load the bases; another walk scored the tying run. 
</p><p>Tyler Young led off the ninth inning with a single to right field and advanced to second on a wild pitch to set up Fujii’s game-winning hit. 
</p><p>CSUMB improved to 1-3.
</p><p>First baseman Tyler Soto had a game-high three hits. Ronnie Fhurong and Young added two hits apiece. 
</p><p>Scott Tully threw seven innings, giving up eight hits and only one earned run. Jake Paolinetti recorded the win with two innings of relief, allowing two runs. 
</p><p>“It is nice to get our first win in front of our home crowd,” said first-year head coach Walt White. “I envision our program as something our university can be proud of and today is a great start. We took one step closer to where we want to be as a program.”
</p><p>The Otters begin a three-game series against Fresno Pacific on Friday, Feb. 11, at 2 p.m. Saturday's doubleheader will get under way at 11 a.m. Read more at <a href="http://otterathletics.com/" title="http://otterathletics.com/">http://otterathletics.com/</a>

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s School of Business and the local Small Business Development Centers are about to begin work on a project to improve the economic vitality of Castroville.
</p><p>Monterey County’s Redevelopment Agency has contracted with the university and its small business development center for work on the Castroville Commercial Improvement Project.
</p><p>The first stage involves surveying residents and businesses. Dr. Murray Millson, professor of marketing at CSUMB, has designed a pair of surveys that will be carried out by university students beginning Feb. 12. The surveys are designed to identify residents’ shopping behavior, and find out what would encourage them to shop locally. Then, business owners will be surveyed to see what they identify as opportunities for improvement and as barriers to their success.
</p><p>The university’s survey efforts will link with the Monterey County Office of Employment Training, which has already interviewed several businesses in Castroville about staffing needs.
</p><p>Using information from the surveys and interviews, the SBDC will determine what services would be helpful and assist business owners in accessing those services. In addition, one-on-one private counseling will be provided by the Central Coast Small Business Development Center at Cabrillo College.
</p><p>Meanwhile, CSUMB’s Small Business Development Center will work with three anchor businesses in the community, helping to define a market niche and maximizing tourism. This effort is intended to increase the number of potential customers for all retail shops in downtown Castroville.
</p><p>Another part of the project involves gauging the success of a culinary academy in the area.
</p><p>“The Small Business Development Center normally focuses on individual businesses,” said Andrea Nield, associate director of the center based at CSUMB. “This project involves a community development research role for the university. The collaboration will yield better results for the community.”
</p><p>The project is scheduled to be finished in June.

</p><h3>Bob Zellner knows risks of fighting for freedom</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s celebration of Black History Month will conclude on Feb. 28 when nationally known civil rights activist Bob Zellner visits campus.
</p><p>“Reflections on 50 Years of Activism” will be his topic. The free event will get under way at 7 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue. The public is invited.
</p><p>Raised in southern Alabama, the son and grandson of Ku Klux Klan members, Zellner rejected racism and fought for civil rights along with his mentor, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today, he is seen as one of the most influential white Southerners of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
</p><p>In his memoir, “The Wrong Side of Murder Creek: A White Southerner in the Freedom Movement,” he recounts how a race relations class in college and young activists who were organizing sit-ins inspired him to make a difference in the segregated South.
</p><p>That led him to take part in some of the most notable events of the movement – as a Freedom Rider, a leader in Freedom Summer, and a participant in marches, sit-ins and protests. He was beaten, imprisoned and arrested 18 times in seven states on charges including criminal anarchy and “inciting the black population to acts of war and violence,” all in an attempt to register voters and bring about change and equality.
</p><p>While studying for a Ph.D. in history at Tulane University in the 1990s, he wrote a dissertation on the Southern civil rights movement. He keeps the stories of the movement alive through his work as a lecturer, his appearance in films documenting the era, and his writing. His memoir is being made into a movie by Spike Lee. He has taped a show with Oprah Winfrey that is scheduled to air in May.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>The Associated Students Cultural Enrichment Committee, Student Activities and Leadership Development, and the Office of the Dean of Students are sponsors of the event. For more information, contact Tim Bills at 582-4645.

</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay’s women’s basketball team grabbed the No. 3 seed in the NCAA West Regional tournament starting Friday in Pomona.
</p><p>Three of the eight teams in the region come from the California Collegiate Athletic Association. 
</p><p>The Otters (26-3) will face the No. 6 seed Dixie State College of St. George, Utah, at 12:30 p.m. The Red Storm compiled a 24-3 record and ended the season with a 21-game home winning streak.
</p><p>To watch the game, click <a href="http://www.broncoathletics.com/sports/2010/11/8/GEN_1108103616.aspx?tab=fanzone">here</a>. The game will be played at Cal Poly Pomona, home of the region’s No. 1 seed. Cal Poly will face the No. 8 seed Cal State San Bernardino.
</p><p>On Saturday, the winner of the CSUMB-Dixie State game will face the winner of the contest between No. 2 seed Grand Canyon and No. 7 Seattle Pacific. The semifinals will be held on Monday, March 14. The final will be held the next night.
</p><p>The Otters lost a chance to be seeded No. 1 when they dropped the CCAA championship game 59-53 to Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday. It was the third time the teams had met this season. The Broncos won two of those matchups, at the Kelp Bed and the championship game at CSU East Bay. <strong>The West Region bracket (at Cal Poly Pomona) Friday’s games</strong> No. 1 Cal Poly Pomona (25-4) vs. No. 8 San Bernardino (21-7) No. 4 Western Washington (26-3) vs. No. 5 Alaska Anchorage (25-6) No. 3 CSUMB (26-3) vs. No. 6 Dixie State (24-3) No. 2 Grand Canyon (27-2) vs. Seattle Pacific (20-8)
</p><p>The entire bracket can be found <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/brackets/basketball-women/d2/2011">here</a>.
</p><p>The Otters finished conference play with a 20-2 record and a one-game margin over Cal Poly Pomona in the 12-team conference.
</p><p>“These kids said yes to a coach who had never been a head coach,” Renee Jimenez said. Jimenez took over the program in 2009. “All these girls took a chance on us and bought into what we were doing.”
</p><p>It’s been a banner year for the Otters: a school-record 26 wins – including a 16-0 run to start the season – and a No. 19 NCAA national ranking in Division II.
</p><p>The OLLI program at CSUMB started in 2007, when 100 students enrolled and has grown steadily each year thanks to exhilarated oldsters. Around 470 students entered the program this year. – <em>Monterey Herald</em>, Feb. 7, 2011

</p><p>Parishioners at three local churches got more than a sermon on Sunday, Feb. 20. They got a pitch for the value of a college education — straight from the pulpit. Cal State Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison, Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe and Vice President for Student Affairs Ronnie Higgs visited churches in Seaside and Pacific Grove as part of a California State University program called Super Sunday. On Sundays through February, dozens of administrators from the CSU system are fanning out to more than 100 black churches across the state to spread the gospel of higher education. The goal is to increase the number of African-American students attending college. Dr. Harrison reminded the congregation at Greater Victory Temple in Seaside that CSUMB “is your hometown university.” She told members of the congregation that CSUMB offers 18 undergraduate degrees and eight master’s programs, and new programs in marine science, environmental studies, Spanish, Japanese and nursing are expected to be added in the near future. “Let’s all work together to make sure children – your children – take advantage of the educational opportunities offered at the CSU so they become the educated minds that will take California to the next stage of economic prosperity,” she told parishioners. She said unemployment figures for California clearly demonstrate the value of a college degree: While those without a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 19 percent, the rate for those with a bachelor’s degree is only 6 percent. The road to college begins early – in the sixth grade, when students should begin taking English. Algebra needs to be tackled in the eighth grade and calculus in the 12th grade, Dr. Harrison told them. “This is why we are here today asking grandparents, parents and mentors to push students to work harder in middle and high school,” she said. “Young people tend to achieve what’s expected of them. They need to know that we expect them to prepare for college.” University staff members passed out information and answered questions at the end of the service. Dr. Cruz-Uribe conveyed the college-going message when she visited Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Seaside; Dr. Higgs took the message to parishioners at the First Baptist Church of Pacific Grove.

</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Danforth continued his Muppets adventure by working on the 2014 film, <em>Muppets Most Wanted.</em> He spent several weeks on the production, assisting with the puppet Sweetums. "I got to work with Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell," he said. "They brought such fun energy to the project. When you're with the Muppets, though, how can you not?"
</p><p>He also worked on The Muppets and Lady GaGa Holiday Special, the Toyota halftime commerical with The Muppets, and "was very fortunate to puppeteer Sweetums for the world premiere of <em>Muppets Most Wanted</em>," he said.
</p><h3>No strings attached to this puppeteer</h3><p>Nathan Danforth revels in breathing life into the inanimate.
</p><p>The 25-year-old graduate of CSU Monterey Bay had a chance to do just that when he worked on "The Muppets," the latest film featuring everyone's favorite characters. Walt Disney Pictures will release it on Nov. 23, just in time for the Thanksgiving weekend.
</p><p>Danforth, a native of New Orleans who grew up in Rocklin, has been acting since he was 6 years old. Monterey County audiences might remember him from his role as Sir Lancelot in the Forest Theater Guild’s production of Camelot in 2008.
</p><p>He didn’t start puppeteering professionally until he moved to Los Angeles after graduating from CSUMB in 2009, but the inanimate characters always fascinated him.
</p><p>“I grew up watching “The Muppet Show,” “Fraggle Rock,” “Eureka’s Castle” and all the Muppet movies. I loved the imagination and fantasy that surrounded the whole concept of these characters. They were fun and adventurous, and to me they were real people,” he said.
</p><p>“In the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, I mostly focused on acting and some technical work, not puppeteering. TAT gave me a great education,” he said.
</p><p>That education has proven useful. “As a puppeteer, you are always acting. You have to be able to show all your emotion and decisions as an actor, and transfer that into your hand,” he said.
</p><p>He still does “fleshy” acting – non-puppet acting roles – mostly in independent films, but his main focus is on puppeteering.
</p><p>To perfect his craft, he worked with the Glendale-based company Swazzle, performing at birthday parties and in libraries. Between gigs, he’d practice at home, spending four hours a day working in front of a monitor.
</p><p>A big break came in 2010 when he worked with Jason Segel on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. The duo sang and puppeteered a version of “Dracula’s Lament” from Segel’s hit film “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.”
</p><p>That led to an offer to build a puppet segment for the television series “How I Met Your Mother.”
</p><p>Then, he got a call from Segel asking if he was free to work on the latest Muppet movie.
</p><p>“As any puppeteer will tell you, that’s a dream call. I was so excited, I couldn’t speak or breathe for 15 seconds.” He even remembers what he was doing when the phone rang – eating pasta and playing Xbox 360.
</p><p>“My first day was like a dream. I walked onto the set and Jason gave me a hug and said, ‘Welcome to the dream, buddy.’ I saw Kermit and Fozzie, and started to tear up. These are my childhood and adult idols, and here they were in front of me.”
</p><p>What started out as a one-day job lasted five months. “After the first day, the producer asked me if I would like to come on full-time and assist the puppet workshop when I wasn’t puppeteering.
</p><p>“It was heaven . . . pure heaven. I feel very lucky to have been given such an opportunity."
</p><p>Since his stint with the Muppets wrapped up, he’s been looking forward to the next opportunity. Perhaps the lovable creations will play a part in his future.
</p><p>“I could not imagine a world without Kermit the Frog or Fraggle Rock or Labyrinth. Those productions so heavily influenced my childhood, my imagination, and my career.”  
</p><p><em>A woman walks alone down a dark, deserted street. With every shadow she sees, and every sound she hears, her pounding heart flutters and skips a beat. She hurries her pace as she sees her destination become closer. She is almost there. She reaches the front door, goes inside, collects herself, and moves on forgetting, at least for tonight, the gripping fear that momentarily enveloped her life.</em>
</p><p>This scene could have occurred anywhere last night, last year, or even 100 years ago. Historically, women faced the anxiety of walking alone at night and that is why Take Back the Night began.
</p><p>The annual Take Back the Night speak-out and march to protest sexual violence will be held from 7 to 9 p.m., March 4 at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The evening will start at 7 p.m., when people will gather in the Student Center to hear speakers and a presentation by representatives from MyStrength, a men’s group dedicated to ending sexual violence. Ivy Baker, a CSUMB student, will talk about her efforts to start a rape awareness program on campus.
</p><p>At 8 o’clock, candles will be lit and the group will march through campus to symbolically reclaim the safety of the night and raise awareness about the issue. The march will end on the quad in front of the Student Center with a moment of silence to pay respect to the victims and survivors of sexual violence.
</p><p>The first Take Back the Night event in the United States took place in Philadelphia in October of 1975. Residents of Philadelphia rallied together after the murder of young microbiologist, Susan Alexander Speeth, who was stabbed by a stranger a block from her home while walking alone.
</p><p>It has been a staple of American campus feminism since then. The event works to empower women and serves as a collective voice to demand an end to the violence.
</p><p>The CSUMB event has been organized by Theta Alpha Sigma sorority.  
</p><h3>Three players named to all-conference team</h3><p>Women's basketball coach Renee Jimenez took Coach of the Year honors in the California Collegiate Athletic Association.
</p><p>Named to the all-conference first-team were seniors Julie Heurung and Michelle Santizo; senior LaShawn Johnson was a second-team pick.
</p><p>"Individual awards are never something we talk about as a team," Jimenez said. "I am proud of these three and happy that they received the recognition they have deserved all season long.
</p><p>"The thing that stands out the most to me about these awards for Tizo, Julie and Shawn is that none of them is averaging double figures in the CCAA. This is a huge testament to them and what the other coaches in the conference think of what an integral part they have been in helping us win the conference."
</p><p>Jimenez went on to add, "These awards could not have happened without the solid play and hard work of their teammates."

</p><h2>‘Carmel-by-the-Sea’ gets first local screening</h2><p>The newly launched Monterey Bay Film Society will hold its first big public event – a screening of “Carmel-by-the-Sea” – on March 19 at Sunset Center.
</p><p>The film was shot on the Monterey Peninsula in 2009, with additional on-location shots filmed recently to give it more of the flavor of Carmel. The movie is about a 15-year-old boy who becomes embroiled in a tale of international art forgery. It stars Alfred Molina, Lauren Bacall, Josh Hutcherson, Hayden Panettiere, and Dina Eastwood (pictured at left, with cinematographer Walt Lloyd), and includes many local residents as extras.
</p><p>This will be the film’s first local showing; it premiered earlier this month in Los Angeles.
</p><p>The 7 p.m. screening is a fundraiser for the film society. Tickets are $10 for students, $25 for general admission, and $100 for VIP seating and a reception. They can be purchased by calling the Sunset Center box office at 620-2048.
</p><p>The Sunset Center showing happened by chance. Producer Michael-Ryan Fletchall had originally planned to premiere it in Carmel, but moved the opening to Los Angeles for business reasons. Then, he was contacted by CSUMB students.
</p><p>“We were on the Peninsula to do some additional photography, and were approached by CSU Monterey Bay students who said they were trying to do a fundraiser . . . ‘Would you be willing to have the screening be part of the event?,’ they asked. We thought it was a great idea,” Fletchall said. That led to the Sunset Center showing.
</p><p>The film society is associated with the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department (TAT) at CSUMB. Its mission is to promote the cinematic arts with year-round programs for the community and to provide free media workshops for at-risk and underserved youngsters throughout Monterey County.
</p><p>“The idea is to support local filmmakers by bringing artists to the area. It will serve as an opportunity for the artists to do community workshops and to speak to film students at the university,” said TAT chair and co-director of the society Enid Baxter Blader. The society’s creative director is Mike Plante of the Sundance Film Festival.
</p><p>Organizers have raised $280,000 in grant money and another $70,000 from private donors to help fund their ambitious plans.

</p><p>A tsunami warning is in effect for the Central Coast of California, including Monterey County, following an 8.9-magnitude earthquake off the coast of northern Japan at 9:45 p.m. PST Thursday. Elevated waves were expected to reach the San Francisco Bay Area about 8 a.m.
</p><p>Because of its elevation, **there is no threat to any part of the CSUMB campus. **
</p><p>However, it is important to stay off beaches and avoid other low-lying areas while the warning is in effect. Tsunamis often arrive as a series of waves, which could be dangerous for several hours after the initial wave arrival.
</p><p>Here is a link to a map showing areas at risk of inundation from a tsunami:

</p><h3>Comedian finds humor in his bid to survive</h3><p>Brian Wetzel was a successful stand-up comedian whose career and personal life were absorbed by his struggle with clinical depression, a struggle that left him on the brink of suicide through his young adult years.
</p><p>“There is nothing funny about being severely depressed, but I had to find humor in my situation in order to stay alive and survive,” said Wetzel, 46, of Santa Rosa.
</p><p>With that, he began to write an autobiographical, one-man show about his 20-year struggle with depression that has since become the focus of his performances across the United States.
</p><p>“My shows and speeches are important because there are too many people in this world who are really hurting emotionally, and they, in turn, hurt themselves or take the ultimate step and take their lives,” he told the Ventura County Star. “It’s important for people to know there is help, but they have to be encouraged to not only muster up the courage and energy to ask for help, but to take the help, too.
</p><p>“That’s what I hope my work will do for people: entertain them, and help them at the same time,” he told the newspaper.
</p><p>At noon on April 5, Wetzel will present “That Voice in the Wilderness is Laughing” at the Black Box Cabaret on the campus of Cal State University, Monterey Bay. The public is invited to this free event. The Black Box Cabaret is located near the intersection of Inter-Garrison Road and Fourth Avenue. A campus map can be downloaded at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>A repeat performance will be held at 8 p.m. for students only.
</p><p>His appearance is part of the university’s observance of Suicide Prevention and Awareness Week.
</p><p>Wetzel’s presentation will cover the many factors that contribute to clinical depression and the complex issues that surround living with and managing this disorder, said Gary Rodriguez, prevention specialist with the campus Personal Growth and Counseling Center.
</p><p>“He shares his experience and offers hope for himself and others as someone who has learned to live with, and manage, his condition,” Rodriguez said.
</p><p>Humor is a way to bring depression to the table in a new way because the subject is something no one wants to talk about, Wetzel said. “My presentation is peppered with humor, including the top five things not to say to someone with depression. My audiences can learn more about this tough subject and they can laugh at the same time,” he told the Star.
</p><p><em>Everyone really got a lot out of the presentation . . . I believe those who have not been clinically depressed got empathy, those who treat the depressed got understanding and ideas about treatment and those who suffer from it got validation and a feeling that they are understood and not alone.</em> – Donnovan Somera Yisrael, health education specialist, Stanford University
</p><p>Gov. Jerry Brown has appointed California State University, Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison to serve on the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE).
</p><p>The commission brings together three representatives – higher education administrators, legislators and community leaders – from each of the 15 Western states, appointed by the governors of those states. WICHE’s mission is to expand access to higher education for the residents of the Western states.
</p><p>The commission meets twice each year.
</p><p>The unpaid position requires confirmation by the state Senate. Dr. Harrison’s appointment will run until Oct. 31, 2014.  
</p><p><strong>By Mike Hornick</strong> In advance of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, an online film journal called IndieWIRE.com took note of the “considerable buzz” being generated by film schools at Cal State Monterey Bay and other places somewhat “off the beaten path.” “Forget about USC or UCLA,” the article said. CSUMB’s answer to traditional film schools – known as the Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology, or “TAT” – continues to create buzz, win acclaim and produce graduates who find success in the varied and competitive world of film and video. TAT integrates a sense of community into each aspect of student experience, from collaborative filmmaking and festivals to service projects in neighboring cities. A strong alumni network spreads that sense of community to places like Los Angeles, supporting new grads as they seek employment. Students get involved quickly – getting their hands on cameras and editing gear early. “You can start making films in your freshman year, where you wouldn’t touch a camera in most schools ’til you’re a junior,” said Janaye Brown, a 2010 graduate. She now pursues a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Texas, Austin, where she earned a David J. Bruton Fellowship. TAT resources more than suffice for the 163 students now in the program, said J.J. Melancon, a senior who aspires to start a production company on the Monterey Peninsula. “There are four different buildings you’re able to edit at – and great production facilities,” he said. Faculty and staff resources are equally varied. “A lot of teachers are or were professionals in the field, so they have connections,” said Adam Younkin, a senior. For example, a TAT project, the Monterey Bay Film Society, employs Mike Plante, the associate programmer for the Sundance Film Festival as creative director. “He brings an unending stream of internationally renowned filmmakers to visit,” said Enid Baxter Blader, TAT department chair. “He’s also visited our Capstone classes,” Blader said, referring to senior students’ thesis project. “Each senior got to pitch film ideas and get feedback from him one-on-one.” The traffic heads Sundance’s way, too. Two films by Cal State Monterey Bay alumni – Doug Mueller and the team of Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck – have screened at the prestigious festival in the past two years. The senior-year projects culminate in the semi-annual, on-campus Capstone Festival, next set for May 20. Last year about 1,100 filmgoers filled the university’s World Theater to view narrative, documentary and experimental films. “It’s absolutely electric,” Blader said. “It’s not only family and friends; it’s really the community coming out for this. That’s unusual for an undergraduate institution.” Other events nearby provide opportunities for TAT students to screen their films or gain curating experience year-round. Student films have shown at two Carmel festivals, in June and October; at Sand City’s West End Festival; and at the Blue Ocean and First Night events in Monterey. TAT started the annual Monterey Bay Film Festival, held this year on April 9. Launched in 2008, it now draws about 300 entries for the teen program. Besides California, they come from such places as El Salvador and Armenia. Plante brings a collection of programs, some straight from Sundance. The festival’s budget was held together at first by duct tape and paper clips, but it has recently benefited greatly from grants and private donations. “Students get to see what it’s like to curate and produce a film festival,” Blader said. “They form relationships with visiting filmmakers who become mentors to them.”
</p><p>Rachel Asendorf, a senior, was a producer’s assistant for last year’s Monterey Bay Teen Young Filmmakers’ program, part of the MBFF. “I watched all the footage and helped categorize things,” she said. “We pick which teen films will be in the festival. I wrangled people for interviews and made sure everyone checked in. This semester I hope to be stage manager.” Students’ interaction with teens – and sometimes children – becomes even more direct in the department’s projects in service learning, which integrates the experience of public service into the academic major. <strong>CREATIVE COMMITMENT</strong> “I love making films, but I found what I really wanted to do was impact youths’ lives in any way I could – by telling stories or just being a friend or role model,” said Juan Ramirez, a 2009 graduate. His service learning project, “Concrete Paradigm,” documented the struggles and hopes of detainees in Monterey County Juvenile Hall. “Concrete Paradigm” won awards for Ramirez and co-director Stephen Sprague at several film festivals. The sequel, “Letters from Within,” was just tapped for a March 19 screening at the International Family Film Festival in Hollywood. Ramirez, who has since become TAT’s community outreach coordinator, is making a third film, “Trojans Under the Helmet,” that looks at social pressures in Salinas through the eyes of athletes. “We didn’t just film,” Ramirez said of the Juvenile Hall projects. “We taught workshops there for a whole year. We got to know them and were mentors.” Added Blader, “The workshops teach teens to value their own stories. They create interconnectedness and hope for kids who feels alone. Juvenile Hall has about a 95 percent recidivism rate; anecdotally we know the incidence is lower for teens we’ve served. “Some have ended up in adult programs for filmmaking. They decided, ‘This is what I want to do.’ That’s powerful.” For her service project, Brown led a filmmaking class for teens at the Salinas Public Library and overcame nervousness about taking the role of teacher. Not every TAT student wants to work in the conventional film industry. Melinda DeRouen, a 2005 graduate, still shoots video but focuses on stage-acting and radio work. And the film work of Brown and Ojeda-Beck – who’s now in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley – is geared as much to galleries as to theaters. “(TAT) exposed me to experimental media,” Brown said. “A lot of that exists in the art world. Had I not gone to CSUMB, I might have worked in a traditional film program.” TAT doesn’t just look at filmmaking, Blader said. “There’s a confluence between film and multiple histories of storytelling,” she said. “We’re looking at the histories of theater, performance, art and avant-garde image-making. This approach gives our students a visual fluency that sets them above the average. This is why they are recognized at international film festivals.” <strong>GRADS REACH BACK</strong> Graduates working in such commercial film centers as Hollywood or San Francisco say the breadth of experience gained at Cal State Monterey Bay helped get their careers off the ground. “I thought I just wanted to write and direct, but TAT opened my eye to everything that was out there,” said Justin Bloch, a 2004 grad who now edits for the Discovery Channel in Hollywood. Like many TAT graduates, Bloch has experience in reality TV. He spent a few seasons at the Fox hit “Hell’s Kitchen.” More recently he edited a new show, “Enough Already,” for the Oprah Winfrey network. TAT grads are a tight-knit bunch. An alumni reunion is slated this spring for a Sunset Boulevard venue. “I’ve gotten and given job leads for TAT students,” Bloch said. “In L.A., we help each other. I’ve become used to hearing (managers) say they’ll hire someone from the same school. They say I’m useful.” Said Blader, “It’s more than references. They hire each other and help each other make their projects, too.” Shawn Hovis is help-desk coordinator for Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville. It’s an information technology job, but Pixar offers him occasional filmmaking opportunities. His live-action short “Play by Play” won the Children’s Choice Award at the Bay Area International Children’s Film Festival and has been accepted to the Cleveland International Film Festival. “Whether you make it or not, much of it is luck,” Hovis said. “But you have to generate things from yourself. TAT gets you going, but they expect a lot out of you.” As 2010 ended, 2001 Oscar-winning grad David Kashevaroff began a four-month, on-location stint in Vancouver, B.C., as first assistant editor for the moon-landing thriller “Apollo 18,” due out in April. “It’s a unique movie in that they’re shooting and editing in a short period,” Kashevaroff said. Other TAT graduates have worked on such recent commercial films as “Coraline” and the latest installments of “Toy Story,” “Terminator” and “Star Trek.” Bloch said TAT taught him that how to collaborate with others on a project. “Everyone has a small part that makes up the larger production,” he said. “Working in L.A., I see people who lose sight of that and fall flat on their face. “A lot of people here only know post-production, so they don’t even talk to people in production. TAT students are able to bridge that gap.”

</p><p>Jazz and world music fusion band Hiroshima will perform at California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater on April 7. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>The group was formed in 1974 by keyboardist and saxophonist Dan Kuramoto, his wife June – one of the world’s foremost players of the koto, a Japanese string instrument – and percussionists/taiko players Johnny Mori and Danny Yamamoto.
</p><p>Its distinctive sound has its roots in East Los Angeles,where Dan Kuramoto grew up. He heard salsa bands playing in the neighborhood dance halls, his grandparents’ Japanese music playing on the home stereo and his brother practicing jazz on the family piano. “It all began to mix together in my head,” he said.
</p><p>In the three-plus decades since the group was formed, it has blended jazz, pop and rock with traditional Japanese folk music. The resulting sound is a pioneering voice in the world music movement – introducing traditional Japanese instruments to a global audience. And selling more than 3 million albums in the process.
</p><p>“We’ve always stood apart from other instrumental groups by taking the graceful classical sound of the koto and experimenting with varying American musical idioms around that,” Dan Kuramoto said.
</p><p>Beyond touring with such greats as Miles Davis, Hiroshima’s members have done some interesting projects. Three of them played on the soundtrack for the Oscar-nominated film “The Thin Red Line,” and Dan Kuramoto has scored more than 50 plays, films and TV shows. He served as musical arranger for the L.A. and New York productions of “Zoot Suit.”

</p><h3>Professor Diana Garcia keynote speaker</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay Professor Diana Garcia will deliver the keynote address at the 10th annual AVID Writers Conference set for March 22 on the CSUMB campus.
</p><p>AVID – Advancement Via Individual Determination — is an in-school academic support program for grades 4-12 that prepares students for success in four-year colleges and universities. A goal is to present opportunities to minority, rural, low-income and other students who don’t have a college-going tradition in their families.
</p><p>More than 450 students and teachers, representing 36 middle and high schools from Palo Alto to Greenfield, are expected to attend the conference. They will have the opportunity to participate in writing workshops led by faculty and staff from CSUMB and other colleges, and will hear from former AVID students about how the skills they developed in the program helped them in college.
</p><p>The conference is the culmination of a “write-off,” a timed-writing exercise modeled after the CSU English placement test. This year’s theme was “How technology is affecting interpersonal relationships.” More than 4,100 middle and high school students participated in the write-off; each school selected its conference attendees based on their performance in the writing exercise.
</p><p>Garcia, a professor in the Division of Humanities and Communication, writes poetry and essays. Her book, “When Living Was a Labor Camp,” published in 2002, was an American Book Award winner.
</p><p>The AVID program has helped make college a reality for thousands of students for over three decades. In California in 2009-2010, 91 percent of AVID seniors had completed four-year college entrance requirements, compared to 36 percent for their statewide counterparts.
</p><p>With better broadband service, residents could be alerted to the dangers posed by forest fires. Medical information could be more readily available to practitioners in rural health clinics. People could have expanded opportunities to access education, and grandparents could connect with their grandchildren via live video. Anyone interested in learning about California’s broadband policy; digital literacy initiatives; cell towers, broadband and land use issues; and fiber to the home is invited to attend a two-day conference, Next Gen Broadband: Filling the Gaps for California’s Communities, to be held March 24 and 25 at CSU Monterey Bay’s Tanimura and Antle Family Memorial Library. The conference is hosted by the university's Wireless Education and Technology Center. Participants will share research and case studies focusing on how broadband applications help to foster economic growth and job creation, sustain small businesses, expand government and community services, and offer incentives for new enterprises. Lev Gonick, chief information officer of Case Western Reserve University, will deliver the keynote address via video conference. His talk, “Building the Smart Connected City: A Platform Vision for the Future,” focuses on bringing fiber connections to five low-income neighborhoods in Cleveland. Researchers believe that broadband, along with training and computers, may be a critical factor in improving these residents’ lives. The two-day registration fee is $95, which includes a reception and dinner at Kula Ranch in Marina. One-day registration is also available. Registration can be completed online <a href="http://wetec.csumb.edu">here</a>. A limited number of complimentary registrations are available. Contact Arlene Krebs, conference director, at (831) 582-5025.

</p><p>When California State University, Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison travels to Jordan and Oman later this month, she will take a step toward the goal of establishing exchange programs with universities in the Middle East.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison is one of seven college and university presidents selected for the 2011 Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program. Her group will leave March 24 for the Middle East and return to the United States on April 8.
</p><p>The seminar is an opportunity for them to learn about the changing higher education scene in the Arab world and return home to share opportunities for future program development in the region with their respective campuses.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison and the other presidents are scheduled to meet with campus leaders in both countries to discuss institutional mission, resources, challenges and opportunities to work with American partners. The trip will provide an opportunity to refine and expand the international vision and agenda of CSU Monterey Bay and the California State University system.
</p><p>“Seminar members will undoubtedly develop a better understanding of these countries’ institutions of higher education,” Dr. Harrison said. “As we share expertise and gain knowledge, we also will be helping to break what President Obama has called a ‘cycle of suspicion and discord’ between the United States and Muslims worldwide."
</p><p>She pointed out that a major objective of participating in the seminar is the chance to develop and strengthen international exchanges and opportunities for students and faculty at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>“I believe it is essential that we are inclusive of countries from all parts of the world,” Dr. Harrison said. “And that includes the Middle East. Our students and faculty can benefit by establishing partnerships with universities in the Middle East. By having their students come to the United States and to California we also add to our existing diversity on our campus."
</p><p>Since arriving at CSUMB in 2006, she has worked to ensure that students not only understand the world in a global context but also experience it first hand by studying abroad.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison’s extensive travel abroad has given her a greater global perspective and made her a strong advocate for international education. During her tenure at Florida State University, she participated in and oversaw international programs as a faculty member and administrator. Her work took her to countries across Western and Eastern Europe and to Vietnam, Israel, Jamaica, Trinidad and Panama.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison’s group will spend five days in Oman before moving on to Jordan for five days. During that time, according to information from the U.S. Department of Education, which administers the program, the group will:
</p><p>• Be exposed to Arab and Islamic culture; • Have opportunities to observe and compare higher education systems with local counterparts; • Meet with Education USA staff members who advise undergraduate and graduate students seeking information about study in the United States; • Have discussions with administrators of study abroad programs for U.S. students; and • Have opportunities to learn of special higher education initiatives such as the El Hassan Science City in Jordan and Oman’s development of a unified online admissions system.
</p><h3>‘Musical conversation’ features Oakland-based dance company</h3><p>Catalyst: One by One, a collaboration between the Dimensions Dance Theater and jazz composer Khalil Shaheed, will get its world premiere at CSU Monterey Bay’s annual Heritage Music Festival on April 16.
</p><p>The 7 p.m. performance will be held in the University Center ballroom on Sixth Avenue and is free. No tickets or reservations are required.
</p><p>Deborah Vaughan, founder and artistic director of the Oakland-based dance company, has collaborated with world renowned musicians, poets, rappers and other dance companies for decades.
</p><p>“I’ve been doing it a really long time. The first was back in the 1980s,” she told the Oakland Tribune. “It was a way to continue to present the work from an African aesthetic, which includes everything – drama, dance, song and spoken word. It’s not broken up into little boxes the way we do in America,” she said.
</p><p>The process for each collaboration is different, depending on the inspiration for the piece. “I might have a message I want to get across or something I am interested in investigating or commenting on,” Vaughan said.
</p><p>At the heart of her collaboration with Shaheed is the artists’ shared belief that art can shift consciousness and bring about transformation in the lives of those who create, experience and are touched by it.
</p><p>In Catalyst, Vaughan and Shaheed focus on the underlying idea of tolerance, and our ability to accept difference. The work will be performed with dancers and drummers from Dimensions Dance Theater, with music performed live by Shaheed and members of the Mo’ Rockin Band. Vaughan calls it a “movement-based musical conversation.”
</p><p>Catalyst celebrates the confluence of dance and music in the region of Morocco and North Africa, where African, Spanish and Arab cultures have co-existed for centuries. Vaughan combines traditional African dance forms with contemporary forms to respond to the music’s rhythms, energy and emotion; Shaheed’s score includes song and instrumentation for both traditional instruments – oud, gimbri and karkabas – and contemporary jazz instruments.
</p><p>“By interweaving many different threads of music and dance into a rich mosaic, Catalyst honors the beauty that results when we celebrate our differences,” Vaughan said.
</p><p>The 12 previous Heritage Music Festivals have presented jazz musicians. “We’re looking at a concept of moving toward a world music festival rather than solely focus on jazz,” said Professor Richard Bains, chair of the Music and Performing Arts Department, the festival’s sponsor. “We are looking at multiple disciplines, including dance. Dimensions Dance Theater is a great way to try out this new approach,” Professor Bains said.

</p><h3>Director Rodrigo Garcia on hand for April 8 screening</h3><p>The Monterey Bay Film Festival is back for its fourth year and it’s bigger and better than ever.
</p><p>Now under the auspices of the newly formed Monterey Bay Film Society, the festival has grown to two days and a pair of locations.
</p><p>This year’s festival will be held April 8 and 9. It opens with a showing of the Mexican film, Revolucion, at 7 p.m., April 8, at Lighthouse Cinema in Pacific Grove. Tickets are $9 for general admission, $6.50 for students.
</p><p>One hundred years after the Mexican Revolution, 10 Mexican directors collaborated on the film, reflecting on the meaning of revolution in contemporary Mexico. It’s made up of 10 films, each 10 minutes long, and showcases a wide range of voices from the vibrant Mexican film scene.
</p><p>One of those voices, Rodrigo Garcia, will be on hand to introduce the film and answer questions after the showing. Son of Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, he directed the film’s final segment, called “7th and Alvarado,” referring to a Latino area of Los Angeles.
</p><p>Garcia (pictured at left) has directed episodes for HBO series including The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Big Love. His film credits include Nine Lives, Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her, and Mother and Child, which was shown at last year’s Sundance Film Festival.
</p><p>On Saturday, April 9, the festival moves to California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater on Sixth Avenue. Saturday’s screenings are free, but reservations are requested and can be made <a href="http://rsvp.csumb.edu">here</a>.
</p><p>Young filmmakers will be in the spotlight as 16 short works – all under 5 minutes – will be shown starting at 1 p.m. Doors open at 12:30 p.m.
</p><p>Some of the films were submitted by local teenagers, some come from overseas. Several were made by CSUMB students. Teen films include an animation from Afghanistan and local films from Rancho Cielo, the Boys and Girls Clubs, and a music video made at the Salinas Public Library.
</p><p>About 3 p.m., “True Stories,” a program of innovative short films curated by Mike Plante, will be screened. Since 2002, Plante has worked as a programmer with the Sundance Film Festival and as director of programming with CineVegas.
</p><p>The Monterey Bay Film Society is presented by CSUMB’s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department. Its inaugural event was held March 5, when the documentary “I Am Secretly an Important Man” was shown at the Osio Theater in Monterey. Peter Sillen, the film’s director, was on hand to answer questions from the audience.

</p><h2>Meet the filmmakers at April 27 event</h2><p>As part of CSU Monterey Bay’s celebration of Earth Week, the award-winning environmental documentary “Fuel” will be screened at 7 p.m., Wednesday, April 27, at the World Theater on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>After the screening, writer-director Josh Tickell and producer Rebecca Harrell Tickell will be on stage to discuss the film and answer questions.
</p><p>Though the film’s premise is simple enough – we are too reliant on oil – its ramifications (economic, environmental and political) are enormous.
</p><p>The film is a highly critical, in-depth, personal journey that examines a host of energy answers to America's oil addiction, as well as offering a critique of the U.S. auto and petroleum industries' role in resisting change.
</p><p>Tickets are $10, or $5 for people willing to sign an Earth Day pledge to make an effort to go green. “Your Earth Day pledge will be signed on magnolia leaves that will be composted after the event,” World Theater Executive Director Joe Cardinalli said. “We hope everyone will sign the pledge.” Tickets can be reserved by calling the World Theater box office at 582-4580 or can be purchased at the door.
</p><p>Tickell, a first-time director, began the journey resulting in the film after watching members of his family suffer from pollution-related cancers as a result of living near petroleum refineries in Louisiana. In 1997, he set out on the road with a biodiesel powered "Veggie Van" and a video camera and began filming what would eventually become known as “Fuel.”
</p><p>"I wanted to make a film about the serious challenges we face and ultimately about the power of every individual to make a difference," Tickell said. He routinely travels to screen the film using biodiesel vehicles. His goal, Tickell said, is to "green the vote" of America by getting everyday people, along with elected officials and energy companies, to support a 10-year plan that will transition America to renewable energy.
</p><p>Harrell Tickell is a veteran producer and musician who specializes in youth activism, education and the environment. She co-directs The Veggie Van Organization, a national nonprofit dedicated to education about sustainable energy.
</p><p>“Fuel” has won numerous awards since its release, including the audience award for best documentary at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.
</p><p>New York Times reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis called the film "sweeping and exhilarating . . . Thanks to an informative, buoyant tone and the director's own restless intelligence, the film preaches to the unconverted with passion, energy and graphics so clear that they would make Al Gore weep all over his PowerPoint."
</p><p>Other reviewers have said:
</p><p>"IMPRESSIVELY COMPREHENSIVE" . . . "Fuel" is a vital, superbly assembled documentary that presents an insightful overview of America's troubled relationship with oil and how alternative and sustainable energies can reduce our country's – and the world's – addictive dependence on fossil fuels." – Gary Goldstein, Los Angeles Times
</p><p>"SWEEPING AND EXHILARATING" . . . Tickell's passionate film goes beyond great storytelling; it rings out like a bell that stirs consciousness and makes individual action suddenly seem consequential. – Caroline Libresco, The Sundance Institute
</p><p>"THE UNOFFICIAL SEQUEL TO AL GORE'S 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' " . . . Tickell gets points for intellectual honesty for directly addressing critics who are concerned that increased use of biofuels will impact the global food supply, possibly pricing poor countries out of the market for such staples as corn. He doesn't dismiss the argument but offers some next generation technological solutions, from algae farms in the desert to "vertical farms" in the cities. – Kerry Lengel, Arizona Republic
</p><h3>Simon Silva lectures at CSUMB April 11</h3><p>Artist and author Simon Silva has channeled the difficult and painful experiences of his childhood in a family of migrant farm workers into bold and proud expressions of Chicano culture.
</p><p>The community is welcome to attend his presentation on “Nurturing Creativity,” set for 7 p.m., April 11, in the University Center on Sixth Avenue on the CSU Monterey Bay campus. The event is free; no tickets or reservations are required.
</p><p>Silva is famous for his vibrant paintings that depict stylized portraits of farm workers bending to harvest crops, suns radiating heat and picturesque fields and valleys. He has used his painting to empower himself, honor Chicano culture and honor the dignity of farm workers.
</p><p>His presentation will provide parents, educators and other community members with tools to help students become critical thinkers, lifelong learners and confident leaders. He will reflect on his own experiences to present art as a means of inspiring learning and as a source of self-esteem, empowerment and cultural pride.
</p><p>At first, Silva had a generic artistic style. He painted horses and landscapes that he thought people might be interested in buying. But literature changed his life.
</p><p>“I had never been a reader,” he said. “The only thing read in our house growing up was the Bible and the yellow pages. Then, my brother-in-law loaned me a copy of “Bless Me, Ultima” by Rudolfo Anaya.
</p><p>“There was so much material that was familiar in terms of characters, story lines and some of the things I had gone through. It was a real revelation and it opened up a whole new world for me.” The book set him on the right path to look at the experiences in his life and to find value in them. “Literature saved me,” he said. “I had tried to run away from these experiences – I was carrying shame about them.
</p><p>“Through Chicano literature, I was able to focus on Chicano culture in my artwork. It’s what I needed to paint—not only for myself but also for those out there who have no self-esteem. It’s an opportunity for me to tell a campesino, ‘You’re important enough for me to paint and you’re also important enough to write about.’
</p><p>“Through my paintings and writings, I’m able to make a powerful situation out of what I had been ashamed of,” he said. “The same can be said for ethnicity. If you’ve been told all your life that you are inferior and can’t do it, you won’t. I was fortunate in that I had my art to keep me going.”
</p><p>The event is sponsored by the Associated Students Cultural Enrichment Committee, Student Activities &amp; Leadership Development, and the Office of the Dean of Students. Books and prints will be available for sale at the event.

</p><p><strong>Otters' historic run: CCAA conference championship, national ranking and NCAA bid</strong>
</p><p>For months, it seemed they couldn’t lose. Even when the Otters’ women’s basketball team finally fell to top rival Cal Poly Pomona after 16 straight victories, they bounced back to win 11 of their next 14.
</p><p>By season’s end, the women had dramatically raised the bar for CSUMB basketball: an unprecedented 27-4 record, a California Collegiate Athletic Association regular-season title, a No. 19 national ranking, Division II’s top defense, a ticket to the NCAA West Regional tournament, and three players named to the all-conference team.
</p><p>The magical season came to an end in the second round of the regional, when the team lost to Grand Canyon University.
</p><p>Coach Renee Jimenez isn’t betting on another 16-0 start, but a dozen returning starters promise to make next year’s team exciting and successful, she said.  
</p><p>The newly formed Monterey Bay Film Society presented by TAT has already staged two successful events. The annual Monterey Bay Film Festival, set for April 8 and 9, promised to be just as exciting.
</p><p>The society’s mission is to promote the cinematic arts with year-round programs and to provide free media workshops for at-risk and underserved youngsters throughout Monterey County. It also intends to bring the most innovative contemporary filmmakers to the Monterey Bay area, holding programs, events and screenings at a variety of venues.
</p><p>CSUMB’s Enid Baxter Blader and Chris Carpenter are co-directors. Mike Plante of the Sundance Film Festival is the society's creative director.
</p><p>“The idea is to support local filmmakers by bringing in artists. It will also serve as an opportunity for them to do community workshops in underserved areas, and speak to film students at the university,’’ Professor Blader noted, adding that organizers had raised $280,000 in grant money and an additional $70,000 from private donors to help fund their ambitious plans.
</p><p>The film society’s inaugural event was held March 5, when the documentary “I Am Secretly an Important Man” was shown at the Osio Theater in Monterey. Peter Sillen, the film’s director, was on hand to answer questions from the audience. The second event was the March 19 screening of “Carmel-by-the-Sea” at Sunset Center in Carmel. Tickets were in big demand for both events; both were sold out.

</p><p>Andrea Aguilar always knew that she wanted to work in the film and TV industry, but CSUMB helped her realize how powerful a tool the media really is.
</p><p>“TV reaches all the corners of the earth. I remember as a child how much information I absorbed because of it,” said Aguilar, a 2007 TAT graduate. “We look to the media for everything. I hope to someday be a big part of that influence.”
</p><p>She’s on the way to accomplishing just that. She’s currently an associate producer for The Rachel Zoe Project on the Bravo cable TV channel. Her other credits include BBQ Pitmasters, LA Ink, Gene Simmons Family Jewels and Big Brother.
</p><p>She’s most proud of her work on The Swell Life featuring champion surfer Izzy Paskowitz and his family. They run Surfers Healing, a nonprofit organization that offers free surf day camps to autistic children. The program will air on Oprah Winfrey’s new cable network OWN.
</p><p>“My work has given me the opportunity to experience different slices of humanity, from surfing cowboys to high-profile fashionistas. It’s awesome to put on different hats and assume someone else’s lifestyle for three to six months,” Aguilar said.
</p><p>“Challenging? Yes. Boring? Far from it.”
</p><p>From her home on Venice Beach – which she shares with her dog, Yoshi – she runs a group on Facebook called TAT Creative Connection. “It’s an alumni group that helps alums and people who have worked with us to stay connected. We post jobs, rooms for rent, projects and discussions,” she said.

</p><p>Long after his notorious prison experiment, famous psychologist teaches how to act heroically
</p><p>Psychologist Philip Zimbardo will make a return visit to CSU Monterey Bay on April 25 to lecture on “Good and Evil: The Heroic Imagination Project.”
</p><p>The free event will start at 7 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue. Reservations are requested and can be made <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dEVYeDZsamd5R0QwODE5cENmSnUzb0E6MA#gid=0">here</a>.
</p><p>Dr. Zimbardo, professor emeritus at Stanford University, first lectured at CSUMB in September 2007, when he discussed his book, “The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil.” A standing-room-only crowd packed the World Theater to hear him.
</p><p>He has spent much of his professional life, including his famous 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, examining how otherwise caring human beings can be easily persuaded or seduced to cross the line between good and evil. The actions of American military police guards at Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison provide just one confirmation of his findings.
</p><p>Recently, he has set out to communicate the opposite: these same people can speak out against evil and become heroes. The non-profit Heroic Imagination Project is his effort to put that idea into broad-based, sustainable action by encouraging young people to think about real heroism and heroic acts.
</p><p>“We are such a celebrity-oriented society, for many young people, being a celebrity has been equated with being a hero,” he said.
</p><p>“Heroes are ordinary people. You become a hero by doing an extraordinary deed.”
</p><p>Last November, Dr. Zimbardo told Monterey Herald columnist Peter Funt: “Heroism can be learned by example and reinforced with practice.
</p><p>“The definition of a hero that I promote is someone who acts voluntarily on behalf of others in need, or in defense of a moral cause, aware of risks and costs, without expectation of tangible rewards,” he told Funt.
</p><p>The Heroic Imagination Project’s pilot program began last September at high schools in Oakland and Los Altos Hills. Students spent the fall semester learning the principles of social psychology that relate to heroism. They watched videos of such famous experiments as Stanley Milgram’s 1963 study on obedience to authority and Dr. Zimbardo’s own prison study. Students gained an understanding of the power of the situation over their own behavior as well as how to surpass these influences and act heroically.
</p><p>Dr. Zimbardo is an internationally recognized scholar, educator, researcher and media personality. He taught at Yale, New York University and Columbia before joining the faculty at Stanford in 1968. He may be best known for his popular television series on PBS, Discovering Psychology.
</p><p>The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by CSUMB Professor Armando Arias.
</p><p>Sponsors include Office of the Dean of the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, InterClub Council, Psi Chi, Kinship Center, Psychology Society, Dr. Jill Yamashita, Dr. Jennifer Dyer-Seymour, Dr. Armando Arias, Student Activities and the Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies.

</p><h2>Kiyo's Story</h2><p>Unlike many of her fellow internees, Kiyo Sato is willing to discuss her family’s experience during World War II.
</p><p>For years, she has spoken to students, church groups and other gatherings about how a frightened nation looking for scapegoats in the hysteria after Pearl Harbor resulted in 120,000 of its Japanese-American residents – most of them American citizens – being thrown into heavily guarded camps in remote and desolate places such as Poston, Ariz.
</p><p>“I believe in everybody talking about it,” Sato told the Sacramento Bee in 2007. “I don’t think it’s something you forget.”
</p><p>In 2007, she wrote an eloquent memoir, “Dandelion Through the Crack.” In its latest edition, the book is titled “Kiyo’s Story: A Japanese-American Family’s Quest for the American Dream.” It won the 2008 William Saroyan Prize for Nonfiction.
</p><p>Sato will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 14 to talk about her life growing up in California, being swept off to an internment camp as an 18-year-old student at Sacramento Junior College, and ultimately surviving and succeeding despite terrible odds and oppressive prejudice.
</p><p>Her talk will start at 2 p.m. in Room 1188 of the Tanimura and Antle Library. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Sato mulled over the idea of writing a book for four decades, taking the occasional writing class. It wasn’t until 2003 that she decided to do it.
</p><p>She told the Bee that she sees the book as a way to make sure the forced internment of America’s residents never happens again.

</p><h2>Next steps</h2><h3>Shoes start a journey of understanding</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay students went barefoot on April 5 to raise awareness of the impact a pair of shoes can have on a child’s life.
</p><p>The effort was part of the international One Day Without Shoes campaign that was originated by TOMS Shoes, a company that donates a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair purchased.
</p><p>CSUMB students kicked off their shoes for a walk around the main quad, through the Dining Commons and the library.
</p><p>“About 15 students marched in our group,” said Alexandra Simard, a student from Orange County. “We had a megaphone, and we used it to ask people to take off their shoes. A lot of them did,” she said. The students who complied with the request “asked us what was going on. It gave us a chance to talk about the issue.”
</p><p>TOMS gives away its shoes to children in 23 countries, including the United States, but primarily in developing countries where children have to walk barefoot to school, to reach clean water or for medical help.
</p><p>“Children who don’t have shoes get diseases,” said Hailey Hohl of Patterson. “Today’s event raises awareness about that.”
</p><p>Added Simard: “Children in developing countries can’t get to school, can't get an education, because they don’t have shoes. Since I’m a college student, I think about that.”
</p><p>Company founder Blake Mycoskie told the Los Angeles Times he expected a 1 million people to participate worldwide.
</p><p>According to the One Day Without Shoes website, shoes are a luxury for hundreds of millions of children, a luxury their families can’t afford.
</p><p>In many developing countries, children walk barefoot for miles risking injury, infection and exposure to soil-transmitted diseases. Many schools require shoes for attendance, giving children without them no opportunity to learn. And some soil-based diseases not only cause physical symptoms, but create cognitive impairment, too, crippling a child's long-term potential.
</p><p>TOMS has sponsored the event for five years, but Mycoskie is nowhere close to his goal of stamping out foot diseases worldwide.
</p><p>He told the Huffington Post:
</p><p>"I think sometimes we forget what we have, and occasionally it's important to remind ourselves. Most people don't even realize how many children in developing countries grow up barefoot and all the risks, infections and diseases they endure. For most of us, modern shoes are so comfortable and accessible, we forget about our feet, but they are a source of constant focus for others.
</p><p>"I wanted everyone to personally understand the impact of shoes," he said, "and the difference they can make, so we thought, 'Why don't we get a taste of what these kids go through every day?' "

</p><h2>New library is all things to all people</h2><p>From the moment it opened at 8 a.m. on Dec. 1, 2008, the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library has been the center of student life at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Having watched construction for two years, students lined up to get their first look inside the 136,000-square-foot structure. They rolled through the doors in numbers that shattered records at the old library. Those numbers have been climbing ever since.
</p><p>The library features three classrooms, two auditoriums, 11 group study areas (that can be reserved online), multimedia equipment and an area designated for lessons in information literacy, along with the stacks of books, periodicals and electronic information.
</p><p>A café and lounge spaces are also part of the building. In addition, the university’s information technology Help Desk provides real-time tech support to library users.
</p><p>It is also home to the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center, the University Writing Program, the Academic Skills Achievement Center and the Student Success Center.
</p><p>“We talk about the library as the ‘living room’ of the university,” said library director Bill Robnett. “It’s the intersection of campus life.”
</p><p>With a three-story atrium, the building feels expansive. Students can check out laptops and are encouraged to re-arrange furniture to suit their needs. The library is also active at night, as both a social hangout and a place to study. 
</p><p>“We have people who seem to live here all the time,” Robnett said. It is especially beneficial for commuter students.
</p><p>Some faculty members maintain office hours in the library, and staff members hold meetings there. The café is a popular place for those purposes.
</p><p>When asked about his “wish list,” Robnett doesn’t hesitate to answer.

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay and Hartnell College are joining forces on a program, called "CSIT-in-3," next fall. – <em>Monterey County Weekly</em>, Dec. 13, 2012
</p><h2>The perfect fling</h2><p>Disc golfers representing three dozen colleges and universities will compete in the fifth annual Collegiate Disc Golf Championships April 14&#45;17 in North Augusta, S.C.
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay earned an automatic berth by virtue of its tie for 11th in last year’s tournament. The Otters, who were scheduled to leave on Tuesday, April 12, go in as the No. 9&#45;ranked team in the nation.
</p><p>The national team championship will be decided at the tourney, as well as singles and doubles titles. The top six individual finishers will earn "All American" honors.
</p><p>Members of CSUMB's team are Danny Messina, Brandon White, Clark Hardenbergh, Ross Sauceda, Samuel Bahlenhorst and Brian Ramler.
</p><p>??Unlike the contestants at that better&#45;known golf event in Augusta, Georgia – about five minutes away – the college golfers take to the air. Like their counterparts in that other sport, the players will hike around the 18&#45;hole courses at the Hippodrome Disc Golf Complex carrying drivers and putters. But instead of clubs made of graphite, they use discs made of durable plastic. Scoring in disc golf is similar to regular or, as the players say, "ball" golf. Players get a certain number of strokes, or tosses, to hit the target – in disc golf, a basket.?? The sport is growing in the college ranks. The first national championship, in 2007, drew a field of six teams; this year’s field has grown six&#45;fold. Augusta State University of Georgia won last year’s team title, the first school outside the Southeastern Conference to do so. The University of Georgia won the first two titles, followed by Mississippi State in 2009.

</p><p>Michael Briley, managing partner of Hayashi &amp; Wayland Accounting and Consulting, LLP, and Mary Adams, president and CEO of the United Way of Monterey County, will be honored at CSU Monterey Bay’s School of Business Showcase. The event will be held May 3 in the University Center starting with a reception at 6 p.m. Dinner and the program will follow. The showcase is intended to play a part in developing a strong relationship between the local business community and the university's School of Business. Proceeds benefit the school’s program fund. Mr. Briley (pictured at right) is this year’s recipient of the business leadership award. He brings 27 years of experience in the accounting industry to his role as managing partner for Hayashi &amp; Wayland, where he leads a firm of nine partners and 100 employees. A community leader, he serves as treasurer for the Hartnell College Foundation and chair of its finance committee. Mr. Briley helped the university develop an accounting concentration and has provided internship and career opportunities for CSUMB students. Ms. Adams (pictured below) will be honored for community leadership. Her career spans more than 25 years in the not-for-profit sector. She has led the United Way since 2001. Prior to joiing that agency, she held key positions with the California Biomedical Research Association, American Heart Association – Western States Affiliate, American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society and Volunteers in Action. She serves on the York School board of trustees and has a leadership role with the Salinas Rotary Club.
</p><p>The leadership awards were inaugurated in 2009 to recognize community leaders who have shown a commitment to CSU Monterey Bay and the mission of the university.
</p><p>Attendees will have the opportunity to meet faculty members, graduating seniors and successful alumni, and to learn more about how the School of Business is educating students to be ethical and effective leaders.
</p><p>Student awards, including one for the school’s outstanding senior, will also be given out at the showcase.

</p><h3>SL Student Leaders log most hours in community service drive</h3><p><em>The end of all education should surely be service to others.</em> ?-- Cesar Chavez Cesar Chavez was an ordinary man with an extraordinary legacy of accomplishment and service to humanity. He believed that people have an obligation to contribute to their community and help others.
</p><p>To ensure that the life, work and values of Chavez continue to inspire all Californians, former Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation to establish March 31 as Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning, a state holiday. At California State University, Monterey Bay, March 31 marked the start of a 36-day community service drive – from Cesar Chavez Day to Cinco de Mayo – coordinated by the university’s Service Learning Institute, the Student Activities office and AmeriCorps. Twenty-one groups – including the Associated Students, fraternities, sororities, student organizations and clubs – entered a friendly competition to see how many hours of community service they could document. The goal was 3,000 hours. It was the first year CSUMB students undertook such an ambitious project. While they fell a bit short – they tallied 2,929 hours, or 94 percent of the goal – the effort was deemed a success. “For a first attempt, we’re pleased with the total,” said Steven Goings, AmeriCorps VIP Leader and service opportunities coordinator for the Service Learning Institute. “We should be proud of ourselves,” Goings added. The Service Learning Student Leaders performed the most hours, recording a total of 659. On Cesar Chavez Day alone, the group tallied 64 hours; they added 595 on College Access Weekend, April 1-3. Omega Delta Phi was second with 435.5 hours and the team representing Return of the Natives was third with 380 hours. In addition to the 21 registered groups, unaffiliated volunteers contributed 279 hours. Goings was quick to give credit to Student Activities Director Tim Bills, who led eight fraternities and sororities to a total of 906 hours, or 35 percent of the total. Goings also credited Kelly Mailly, coordinator of leadership development in Student Activities, for working with five members of the Inter-Club Council. Among them, the clubs logged 161 hours of service. On May 12, certificates of recognition will be awarded to the participating teams. The AmeriCorps team at CSUMB will also be recognized, as an acknowledgment of National AmeriCorps Week. The campus community is invited to join the celebration from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the Student Center.
</p><p>“The people who participated in the Cesar Chavez Challenge have truly helped us to create and enhance a culture of service on our campus,” Goings said.
</p><p>Final tally: 1 – Service Learning Student Leaders = 659 Hours 2 – Omega Delta Phi = 435.5 Hours 3 – Return of the Natives = 380 4 – Student Housing and Residential Life = 303 5 – Lambda Theta Nu = 164 6 – Theta Alpha Sigma = 128 7 – Student Peace Alliance = 88 8 – Students for Quality Education = 88 9 – Kappa Delta Chi = 69.5 10 – Green Team = 69 11 – Kappa Sigma = 55 12 – Beta Beta Beta = 46.5 13 – Science Club = 33 14 – Black Students United = 30 15 – Friends of Ivy League = 18 16 – Pre-Medical Society = 18 17 – Associated Students = 17.5 18 – Campus Dining Services = 15 19 – MEChA = 13.5 20 – Law Club = 12 21 – Sigma Omega Nu = 8 22 – Unaffiliated = 279
</p><p>Total = 2,929.5  
</p><p>Arturo Contreras has a knack for helping small businesses prosper. As a junior consultant at California State University, Monterey Bay’s Small Business Development Center (SBDC), Contreras helps entrepreneurs create a blueprint for success.
</p><p>A Gonzales native who transferred to CSUMB from Hartnell College in Salinas, he has worked at the SBDC in his hometown for a year. His clients include plumbers, salon owners and bookkeepers.
</p><p>The work also lets him practice concepts he learned in courses: financial management, competitor analysis and marketing research.
</p><p>“By helping a small number of businesses we are actually making a big difference,” he said.
</p><p>After graduation in May, Contreras hopes to work at a local accounting firm and eventually be a certified public accountant with his own firm.  
</p><p>Todd Hallenbeck will complete his master’s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy this spring. A San Jose native, Hallenbeck is also the recipient of a Sea-Grant West Coast Governor’s Agreement Fellowship.
</p><p>This fellowship allows him to work with state and federal agencies for two years, implementing progressive regional marine policy off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.
</p><p>Hallenbeck’s master’s thesis, concerning the distribution of biological communities in soft sediment habitats of Monterey Bay, helped prepare him for that challenge.
</p><p>“This will be an incredible opportunity to witness firsthand how science translates to policy,” Hallenbeck said, “and will put to good use all the skills and experiences I have gained from being at CSUMB.”
</p><p>In advance of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, an online film journal called IndieWIRE.com took note of the “considerable buzz” being generated by the film school at Cal State Monterey Bay and other places somewhat “off the beaten path.”
</p><p>“Forget about USC or UCLA,” the article said.
</p><p>CSUMB’s answer to traditional film schools – known as the Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology Department, or TAT – continues to create buzz, win acclaim and produce graduates who find success in the varied and competitive world of film and video.
</p><p><strong><em>Chris Carpenter, media production specialist for the Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology Department, demonstrates use of a video camera to TAT students (from left) Shantel Byrd, J. J. Melancon and Ryan Elam in the department's studio.</em></strong>
</p><p><strong>Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology major</strong> These are examples of major learning outcomes expected for students graduating with a B.A. degree in Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology: • Gain an overview of media and foundational skills in storytelling, media criticism, history, ethics and application of knowledge in service to the community. • Analyze major historical movements of film and their interrelationships with each other and with technological, social and historical changes. • Practice and gain competency in developing written and visual content through such processes as research, proposal writing, story treatments, storyboarding, script writing and planning of production details. • Learn the production process in creation of live and media-based work. • Prepare work for media-based production and live events, which may include editing, graphics, special effects, image enhancement, audio mixing, etc. • Present work to an audience via publishing, broadcasting, internet streaming, documentation, screening and other distribution channels. • Demonstrate comprehensive knowledge in media through completion of a creative project that synthesizes the major learning outcomes.
</p><p>TAT integrates a sense of community into each aspect of student experience, from collaborative filmmaking and festivals to service projects in neighboring cities. A strong alumni network spreads that sense of community to places like Los Angeles, supporting new grads as they seek employment. Students get involved quickly – getting their hands on cameras and editing gear early.
</p><p>“You can start making films in your freshman year, where you wouldn’t touch a camera in most schools ’til you’re a junior,” said Janaye Brown, a 2010 graduate. She is now pursuing a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Texas, Austin, where she earned a David J. Bruton Fellowship.
</p><p>TAT resources more than suffice for the 163 students now in the program, said J.J. Melancon, a senior who aspires to start a production company on the Monterey Peninsula. “There are four different buildings you’re able to edit in – and great production facilities,” he said.
</p><p>Faculty and staff resources are equally varied.
</p><p>“A lot of teachers are or were professionals in the field, so they have connections,” said Adam Younkin, a senior.
</p><p>For example, a TAT project, the Monterey Bay Film Society, employs Mike Plante, the associate programmer for the Sundance Film Festival as creative director. “He brings an unending stream of internationally renowned filmmakers to visit,” said Enid Baxter Blader, TAT department chair.
</p><p>“He’s also visited our Capstone classes,” Blader said, referring to senior students’ thesis project. “Each senior got to pitch film ideas and get feedback from him one-on-one.”
</p><p>The traffic heads Sundance’s way, too. Two films by Cal State Monterey Bay alumni – Doug Mueller ’03 and the team of Robert Machoian ’07 and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck ’09 – have screened at the prestigious festival in the past two years.
</p><p>The senior-year projects culminate in the semi-annual, on-campus Capstone Festival, set for May 20. Last year filmgoers filled the university’s 427-seat World Theater to view narrative, documentary and experimental films.
</p><p>“It’s absolutely electric,” Blader said. “It’s not only family and friends; it’s really the community coming out for this. That’s unusual for an undergraduate institution.”
</p><p>Other events nearby provide opportunities for TAT students to screen their films or gain curating experience. Student films have shown at two Carmel festivals, in June and October; at Sand City’s West End Festival; and at the Blue Ocean and First Night events in Monterey.
</p><p>TAT started the annual Monterey Bay Film Festival, held this year on April 9. Launched in 2008, it now draws about 300 entries for the teen program. Besides California, they come from such places as El Salvador and Armenia. Plante brings a collection of programs, some straight from Sundance. The festival’s budget was held together at first by duct tape and paper clips, but it has recently benefited greatly from grants and private donations.
</p><p>“Students get to see what it’s like to curate and produce a film festival,” Blader said. “They form relationships with visiting filmmakers who become mentors to them.”
</p><p>Rachel Asendorf, a senior, was a producer’s assistant for last year’s Young Filmmakers program, part of the MBFF.
</p><p>“I watched all the footage and helped categorize things,” she said. “We pick which teen films will be in the festival. I wrangled people for interviews and made sure everyone checked in. This semester I hope to be stage manager.”
</p><p>Students’ interaction with teens – and sometimes children – becomes more direct in the department’s projects in service learning, which integrates the experience of public service into the academic major.
</p><p>“I love making films, but I found what I really wanted to do was impact youths’ lives in any way I could – by telling stories or just being a friend or role model,” said Juan Ramirez, a 2009 graduate. His service learning project, “Concrete Paradigm,” documented the struggles and hopes of detainees in Monterey County Juvenile Hall.
</p><p>“Concrete Paradigm” won awards for Ramirez and co-director Stephen Sprague at several film festivals. The sequel, “Letters from Within,” was tapped for a March 19 screening at the International Family Film Festival in Hollywood. Ramirez, who has since become TAT’s community outreach coordinator, is making a third film, “Trojans Under the Helmet,” that looks at social pressures in Salinas through the eyes of athletes.
</p><p>“We didn’t just film,” Ramirez said of the juvenile hall projects. “We taught workshops there for a whole year. We got to know them and were mentors."
</p><p>Added Blader, “The workshops teach teens to value their own stories. They create interconnectedness and hope for kids who feel alone. Juvenile Hall has about a 95 percent recidivism rate; anecdotally we know the incidence is lower for teens we’ve served. Some have ended up in adult programs for filmmaking. They decided, ‘This is what I want to do.’ That’s powerful.”
</p><p>For her service project, Brown led a filmmaking class for teens at the Salinas Public Library and overcame nervousness about taking the role of teacher.
</p><p>Not every TAT student wants to work in the conventional film industry. Melinda DeRouen, a 2005 graduate, still shoots video but focuses on stage-acting and radio work. And the film work of Brown and Ojeda-Beck – who’s now in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley – is geared as much to galleries as to theaters.
</p><p>“(TAT) exposed me to experimental media,” Brown said. “A lot of that exists in the art world. Had I not gone to CSUMB, I might have worked in a traditional film program.”
</p><p><strong>'ABOVE THE AVERAGE'</strong>
</p><p>TAT doesn’t just look at filmmaking, Blader said.
</p><p>“There’s a confluence between film and multiple histories of storytelling,” she said.
</p><p>"We’re looking at the histories of theater, performance, art and avant-garde image-making. This approach gives our students a visual fluency that sets them above the average. This is why they are recognized at international film festivals.”
</p><p>Graduates working in such commercial film centers as Hollywood and San Francisco say the breadth of experience gained at Cal State Monterey Bay helped get their careers off the ground.
</p><p>“I thought I just wanted to write and direct, but TAT opened my eyes to everything that was out there.” said Justin Bloch, a 2004 grad who now edits for the Discovery Channel in Hollywood.
</p><p>“Because I was familiar with both production and postproduction, I helped organize the structures here. It was all something I had done before.”
</p><p>Like many TAT graduates, Bloch has experience in reality TV. He spent a few seasons at the Fox hit “Hell’s Kitchen.” More recently he edited a new show, “Enough Already,” for the Oprah Winfrey network.
</p><p><strong>GRADS REACH BACK</strong>
</p><p>TAT grads are a tight-knit bunch. An alumni reunion is slated this spring for a Sunset Boulevard venue.
</p><p>“I’ve gotten and given job leads for TAT students,” Bloch said. “In L.A., we help each other. I’ve become used to hearing (managers) say they’ll hire someone from the same school. They say I’m useful.”
</p><p>Said Blader,“It’s more than references. They hire each other and help each other make their projects, too.”
</p><p>Shawn Hovis is help-desk coordinator for Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville. It’s an information technology job, but Pixar offers him occasional filmmaking opportunities.
</p><p>His live-action short “Play by Play” won the Children’s Choice Award at the Bay Area International Children’s Film Festival and has been accepted to the Cleveland International Film Festival.
</p><p>“Whether you make it or not, much of it is luck,” Hovis said. “But you have to generate things from yourself. TAT gets you going, but they expect a lot out of you.”
</p><p>As 2010 ended, 2001 Oscar-winning grad David Kashevaroff began a fourmonth, on-location stint in Vancouver, B.C., as first assistant editor for the moon-landing thriller “Apollo 18,” due out in April.
</p><p>“It’s a unique movie in that they’re shooting and editing in a short period,” Kashevaroff said.
</p><p>Other TAT graduates have worked on such recent commercial films as “Coraline” and the latest installments of “Toy Story,” “Terminator” and “Star Trek.”
</p><p>Bloch said TAT taught him how to collaborate with others on a project.
</p><p>“Everyone has a small part that makes up the larger production,” he said. “Working in L.A., I see people who lose sight of that and fall flat on their face. A lot of people here only know postproduction, so they don’t even talk to people in production. TAT students are able to bridge that gap.”
</p><p>From the moment it opened at 8 a.m. on Dec. 1, 2008, the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library has been the center of student life at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p><strong>Library at a glance</strong> The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library is at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Divarty Street, with parking accessible from Divarty. <strong>Ways to help</strong> • To buy a book for the library from its wish list, visit the Alumni <a href="http://csumb.edu/alumni/giving-back">"giving back" page</a>. • Naming opportunities still exist for library spaces.

A schedule is available at the <a href="http://csumb.edu/library">CSUMB library page</a>. • Public visitors must purchase a parking pass from machines on the lots. Cost is 50 cents per hour.
</p><p>Having watched construction for two years, students lined up to get their first look inside the 136,000-square-foot structure. They rolled through the doors in numbers that shattered records at the old library. Those numbers have been climbing ever since.
</p><p>The library features three classrooms, two auditoriums, 11 group study areas (that can be reserved online), multimedia equipment and an area designated for lessons in information literacy, along with the stacks of books, periodicals and electronic information.
</p><p>A café and lounge spaces are also part of the building. In addition, the university’s information technology Help Desk provides realtime tech support to library users.
</p><p>It is also home to the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center, the University Writing Program, the Academic Skills Achievement Center and the Student Success Center.
</p><p>“We talk about the library as the ‘living room’ of the university,” said library director Bill Robnett. “It’s the intersection of campus life.”
</p><p>With a three-story atrium, the building feels expansive. Students can check out laptops and are encouraged to rearrange furniture to suit their needs. The library is also active at night, as both a social hangout and a place to study.
</p><p>“We have people who seem to live here all the time,” Robnett said. It is especially beneficial for commuter students.
</p><p>Some faculty members maintain office hours in the library, and staff members hold meetings there. The café is a popular place for those purposes.
</p><p>When asked about his “wish list,” Robnett doesn’t hesitate to answer.
</p><p>“An endowment to support the academic collection is an urgent need,” he said. “When I say ‘collection,’ I mean all kinds of formats, not just books. We want to get into more multiple-platform content.”
</p><p>Many students are pleased with the library just the way it is.
</p><p>“The other library – we’d go in there to study and it was dark and uninviting,” said junior Madison Gipe. “This one is really geared for students. And they serve the best coffee. I’m in here nearly every day.”
</p><p>Dozens of students from Rolling Hills Middle School in Wattsonville voluntarily spent their last week of winter break studying algebra – and having fun.
</p><p>The Algebra Academy was held at the headquarters of the Graniterock company in Watsonville from Jan. 3 through 6. On Friday of that week, the youngsters spent the day on the campus of Cal State Monterey Bay and then returned to Graniterock for a graduation ceremony on Saturday.
</p><p>CSUMB math faculty member Dr. Hongde Hu and lecturer Lorraine O’Shea taught the classes, assisted by four university students.
</p><p>The goal was to get students up to speed with standards recently adopted by the California Department of Education that mandate preparation in algebra. The students worked with tablet PCs provided to CSUMB by Hewlett Packard as part of an EdTech Innovators grant it awarded the university last year – one of only 10 given out worldwide.
</p><p><strong>How to help</strong> To support a CSUMB-staffed academic opportunity for students, contact Executive Director of Univeristy Development Mike Mahan at 582-3366 or <a href="m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x68;&#x61;n&#64;&#99;&#115;&#117;&#109;&#98;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">mmahan@csumb.edu</a>.
</p><p>Graniterock CEO Bruce Woolpert and assistant general counsel Kevin Jeffery spearheaded the academy.
</p><p>The company has worked with Rolling Hills for four years, sending tutors from the company to help with English, art, math and science, as well as hosting events such as awards ceremonies for students who get good grades.
</p><p>“The academy is also intended to build a strong math foundation through hands-on activities with algebra applications in the real world,” Dr. Hu said.
</p><p>Among the problems students worked on were figuring the odds of winning a state lottery and determining why California license plates need three letters.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the middle school students spent time in a math classroom where they played a game called “Survivor: Math Camp” that called on the skills they learned earlier in the week. They also got a campus tour, ate in the dining hall and learned what steps they should follow to prepare for college.
</p><p>Their campus visit clearly made an impression. Some indicated the experience made them want to attend college, especially CSUMB.
</p><p>Rolling Hills principal Rick Ito appreciated the opportunity for his students to participate in the program.
</p><p>“I think the important thing is that students have seen math in a different way,” Ito said. “It’s not just in a classroom. It’s all around us.”
</p><p>He also complimented the work of the CSUMB students.
</p><p>“The four teaching assistants really made a connection with the students,” Ito said. “They’re a bridge between the professors and the youngsters, and they’ve done a great job.”
</p><p>The new Foundation of California State University, Monterey Bay is bringing community and campus leaders together to foster support for the university’s philanthropic needs and goals.
</p><p><strong>To learn more</strong> For information on the Foundation of California State University, Monterey Bay, contact Development at 582-3366 or by email to <a href="&#109;a&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#106;&#x68;&#101;&#x6d;&#112;y&#x40;&#99;&#x73;&#117;&#x6d;&#98;&#x2e;&#101;&#x64;&#117;">jhempy@csumb.edu</a>.
</p><p>A 10-member board of directors meets in public at least quarterly to review progress, build support for educational programs and facilities, and promote awareness and understanding of CSUMB’s higher education mission.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison, who invited the initial directors, also serves on the board. Mike Mahan, executive director of university development, serves as the foundation’s chief executive officer, and Salinas attorney Robert Taylor is chair. Directors include community members, faculty and student representatives.
</p><p>“The foundation is focused on where the community sees the university going – how the community can support the university, and how it will support the community,” Mahan said. Incorporated as a nonprofit in April 2009, the foundation will provide stewardship of charitable gifts to help fulfill the university’s mission.
</p><p>The foundation has taken over philanthropic oversight from the University Corporation at Monterey Bay, which still manages CSUMB’s auxiliary business operations. The foundation will be able to make private support its “sole focus,” Mahan said.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison said she is grateful for the directors’ service and their substantial contribution to the university.
</p><p>***The Cal State Monterey Bay women’s basketball team celebrates its California Collegiate Athletic Association championship on March 1 following a victory over Sonoma State in the Kelp Bed at the Otter Sports Center. ***
</p><p>For months, it seemed they couldn’t lose.
</p><p>Even when the Otters women’s basketball team finally fell to top rival Cal Poly Pomona after 16 straight victories, they bounced back to win 11 of their next 14.
</p><p>By season’s end, the women had dramatically raised the bar for Cal State Monterey Bay basketball: an unprecedented 27-4 record, a championship in the California Collegiate Athletic Association conference, a No. 19 national ranking, Division II’s top defense, a ticket to the NCAA West Regional tournament, and three players named all-conference.
</p><p>“This is the most unselfish team I’ve ever been a part of as a player or a coach, and I think that’s what got us to the point we are this season,” said head coach Renee Jimenez, who was named CCAA Coach of the Year. “They stayed away from each other’s strengths and completed each other’s weaknesses.”
</p><p>The Otters claimed the CCAA title outright and nearly won the conference tournament, losing to rival Cal Poly Pomona in the final. They crushed Dixie State in the first round of the regional and then went cold against Grand Canyon University.
</p><p>“In the locker room, I told them, ‘You followed the game plan absolutely perfectly, and the ball just didn’t drop tonight,’” Jimenez said. “A few more shots drop, and it’s a ball game.
</p><p>”She’s not betting on another 16-0 start, but a dozen returning players and strong freshmen will create a fun, exciting and successful team next season, she said.
</p><p>“I do think that next year’s team is going to peak at just the right time to make a run through the NCAA tournament,” Jimenez said.  
</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison was on a trip to Jordan and Oman from March 24 to April 8 as one of seven college and university leaders selected for the 2011 Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program.
</p><p>The seminar was an opportunity for them to learn about the changing higher education scene in the Arab world and return home to share opportunities for future program development in the region with their respective campuses.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison and the other presidents planned to meet with campus leaders in both countries to discuss institutional missions, resources, challenges and opportunities to work with American partners. The trip provided an opportunity to refine and expand the international vision and agenda of Cal State Monterey Bay and the California State University system.
</p><p>“Seminar members will undoubtedly develop a better understanding of these countries’ institutions of higher education,” Dr. Harrison said before her journey. “As we share expertise and gain knowledge, we also will be helping to break what President Obama has called a ‘cycle of suspicion and discord’ between the United States and Muslims worldwide.”
</p><p>She pointed out that a major objective of participating in the seminar is the chance to develop and strengthen international exchanges and opportunities for students and faculty at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>“I believe it is essential that we are inclusive of countries from all parts of the world, and that includes the Middle East,” Dr. Harrison said. “Our students and faculty can benefit by establishing partnerships with universities in the Middle East. By having their students come to the United States and to California, we also add to our existing diversity on our campus.”

</p><p>Administrators across the CSU system fanned out to more than 100 black churches to spread the gospel of higher education and encourage more African-Americans to attend college.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison reminded the congregation at Greater Victory Temple in Seaside that CSUMB “is your hometown university.”
</p><p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe visited Bethel Missionary Baptist Church in Seaside, and Dr. Higgs spoke at the First Baptist Church of Pacific Grove.
</p><p>The university Athletic Department has hired experienced coaches to lead the baseball, cross-country and men’s soccer programs.
</p><p>Walter White, a former assistant baseball coach at Sonoma State University who also played professional baseball, is now in his first year with the Otters. Athletic Director Vince Otoupal said White’s “reputation as a teacher and recruiter is impressive.” He has a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology from Sonoma State and a master’s in education from the University of Phoenix.
</p><p>In March, Otoupal announced selection of Rob Cummings as head men’s soccer coach. Cummings was associate head coach at Midwestern State (Texas) for the past four seasons, including two Final Four appearances and four Lone Star Conference crowns. Otoupal called him “a proven winner” whose teams have record of success on and off the field. Cummings has a bachelor’s degree in education from Lindenwood University and an MBA from Rockhurst University.
</p><p>Cross country coach Greg Rhines was hired last summer to direct both the men’s and women’s teams. In his previous year as coach at San Joaquin Delta College, he guided the women to a top 15 ranking in the state. Rhines, who also coached at the high school level, has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Sacramento State University and a master’s in counseling psychology from John F. Kennedy University.
</p><p> 
</p><p>Justin Wellner joined CSUMB as director of governmental and external relations in January.
</p><p>Wellner came to the university from Van Scoyoc Associates in Washington, D.C., where he was manager of government relations, directing the federal advocacy agenda for education clients, including the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities.
</p><p>He worked on policy and legislative issues related to higher education such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), standards and assessment, teachers, access and persistence, and research and development.
</p><p>Wellner is responsible for advancing the university’s priorities on the local, state and federal levels. His position will cover a range of duties including advocacy, policy analysis, land use and FORA issues, and liaison with local municipalities, as well as oversight of Strategic Communications.
</p><p>CSUMB President Dianne Harrison has recently accepted several positions with national organizations.
</p><p>In late February, Dr. Harrison was appointed to the board of directors of the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U). She is one of seven educational leaders from a wide array of institutions to join the board. The AAC&amp;U is a national association concerned with the quality, vitality and public standing of undergraduate liberal education. Its membership includes more than 1,200 public and private schools.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison has also been elected to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II Presidents Council.
</p><p>The 15-member council, composed of presidents and chancellors from member schools, is the chief governing body for NCAA Division II athletics. Its responsibilities include ratifying, amending or rescinding actions of the Division II Management Council, developing and approving budgets and expenditures, and implementing policies and procedures pertaining to Division II athletics.
</p><p>She also serves on the NCAA’s Student-Athlete Advisory Council as an ex-officio member representing the Presidents Council.  
</p><p>Earl Lawson is the university’s new chief of police. Lawson served in a number of important roles since joining the University Police Department in 1995, most recently as operations lieutenant and briefly as interim police chief upon the retirement of former chief Fred Hardee last June.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison said Lawson was selected for the breadth of his experience, which includes special training in disaster preparedness and collaboration with local law enforcement.
</p><p>Lawson, who was sworn in Nov. 1, has a B.A. degree in sociology from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. His extensive professional education includes training at the FBI National Academy.
</p><p>Martin Vargas-Garcia, a 2009 graduate, represented alumni as a featured speaker at the Feb. 26 Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction, making the connection between a scholarship he received at CSUMB and his career success.
</p><p>Vargas-Garcia double-majored in Business Administration and Visual &amp; Public Art and was the first in his family to earn a degree, after transferring from Hartnell College in Salinas. Before attending college, he worked in the fields of the Salinas Valley, harvesting vegetables.
</p><p>For almost two years, he has worked at Sakata Seed America Inc. in Morgan Hill, the company’s North and South American headquarters. His current title is priming operations manager, and he is a serious photographer in his spare time.
</p><p>Vargas-Garcia grew up in Salinas, where he now lives with his wife, Juanita, and their two children – daughter, Itzel, 9, and son, Diego, 5.
</p><p>He credits his success in the workplace to the support of his family and the help and encouragement he received from professors. His $1,000 agribusiness scholarship also made a big difference, he said.
</p><p>“That scholarship paid for my school supplies and allowed me to focus full-time on my studies at a critical time,” said Vargas-Garcia, who also received the Alumni Vision Award in his senior year.

</p><p>Dear friends of CSU Monterey Bay,
</p><p>This twice-yearly magazine is all about pride – the university’s pride in its progress, and what I hope is your pride as an alum or supporter who feels connected to us. Each issue highlights the many exciting things happening on our campus: Stories about student achievement represent the success of many more students like them. News of our faculty’s professional accomplishments is a sampling of their varied and important work. Alumni “class notes” are a glimpse of our graduates' contributions through careers and service.
</p><p>In this edition, you’ll read how students in our Teledramatic Arts &amp; Technology Department are preparing to achieve at the highest level in the competitive fields of film and television. Another article is an update on our new library, which has proven to be a fantastic academic resource and a gathering place for our students. We describe how a community partner, the Graniterock company, joined with our Mathematics Department to prepare middle school students to excel in high school algebra and beyond. And, of course, we are thrilled to celebrate a historic season for the Otters women’s basketball team, which was nationally ranked and competed in the NCAA tournament.
</p><p>All of this is part of the larger and very exciting story of CSU Monterey Bay that continues to unfold as we prepare for our 15th annual Commencement. At a time of financial difficulty, when Californians are being asked to reconsider their priorities, we count on your support for this university and for higher education in general. We look forward to many more opportunities to share news about academic achievement, educational excellence and community partnerships. I know we will continue to accomplish a great deal for our students and the communities we serve, especially with your help.
</p><p>Sincerely, Dianne F. Harrison, Ph.D.
</p><p>Dear alumni, friends, and family,
</p><p>I often talk about the benefits of connecting to the Alumni Association and participating in one of the many activities on campus. The Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction is always a wonderful event, and I am pleased to say it was very successful again this year. I especially want to thank the members of the board of directors and all the alumni volunteers for their participation on Feb. 26. They, along with university staff and faculty, did an amazing job helping to raise funds for future scholarships.
</p><p>This is your alma mater, and I hope you will join me in making it as successful as possible. Visiting our newly redesigned website, CSUMB.edu/alumni, is a means of staying connected to your fellow alums and the university as a whole. You can also stay engaged and find out about upcoming events by following CSUMB on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or through our monthly e-newsletter.

</p><p>. . . We are leading the transformation of Fort Ord. The economy has delayed several projects on the former Army base, but the university keeps moving ahead – in enrollment, employment, facilities and housing. With a payroll of nearly 900, CSUMB is one of the county's 20 largest employers and a key player in its vital economic sector of higher education. – <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>, Jan. 8, 2012 
</p><h3>All-female group visits April 30, May 1</h3><p>In a musical genre dominated by men, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles has been breaking stereotypes and shaping new cultural traditions since 1994.
</p><p>The 12-member all-female group brings sensitivity, beauty and warmth to Mexico’s musical heritage and has earned a reputation in the industry as a pioneer. Back by pipular demand after thrilling sold-out performances the last three years, Mariachi Reyna will return to CSU Monterey Bay's World Theater for performances on April 30 and May 1. Both shows will start at 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>Now there are other all-female mariachi groups, proving that when maestro Jose Hernandez created Reyna de Los Angeles, it wasn’t a novelty – it was a genre. Reyna has expanded the role of women in mariachi from singers to a full complement of musical performers. In a musical landscape where songs are often written by men and about male perspectives, Reyna has created its own history.
</p><p>“I knew there were enough excellent female musicians to do it, and I didn’t want guys to say, ‘They play like girls,’ ” Hernandez said. “Now guys from other groups come up to me and tell me that they can’t get over how these girls sound so amazing. It’s because they sound like angels, and that’s why they are named after the City of Angeles.”
</p><p>Under Hernandez, the group has released three albums: Solo Tuyo (Yours Only), El Mejor Mariachi Feminino del Mundo (The Best Female Mariachi in the World), and Companeras, which was nominated for Grammy and Latin Grammy awards in 2009.
</p><p>The group will be on stage at the World Theater in time for Cinco de Mayo. The booking wasn’t an accident.
</p><p>“Each year, the World Theater hosts a production commemorating Cinco de Mayo,” said Joe Cardinelli, executive director of university performances and special events.
</p><p>“Besides presenting an evening of memorable music and song, Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles’ performance follows our mission to educate and enlighten our campus and local communities through diverse entertainment and performances,” Cardinalli said.
</p><p>Tickets prices: $40 Gold Circle, $29 general admission, with discounts available for senior citizens, students, military and children. They can be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580 or <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">online</a>.
</p><p>The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue between A and B streets on the CSUMB campus. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">here</a>. 
</p><h2></h2><p>Chinatown community garden
</p><h2>Federal grant provides support for Community Food Project</h2><p>The fragrant garden that sprang up on an abandoned lot in the Chinatown neighborhood of Salinas offers residents a daily reminder that hope can rise from unexpected places. By replacing urban neglect and illicit drug dealing with nutritious food and employment, the garden has brought lush growth and vibrant color to a community that had lacked both.
</p><p>Now, through a $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, CSU Monterey Bay’s Service Learning Institute is about to start work on two new community gardens based on the Chinatown model. The award was made by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and is designed to help local organizations fight hunger.
</p><p>Part of what CSUMB is calling the Salinas-Marina Community Food Project, the new gardens will be located at: • The Housing Authority of Monterey County's Pueblo del Mar, a transitional housing program in Marina run by the Sun Street Center for formerly homeless families with substance abuse issues. The families will learn about gardening and nutrition as part of their recovery. • Shoreline Workforce Development Service, a division of Goodwill Industries, located in Marina. Participants in the culinary job-training program will learn about gardening and cooking using fresh produce. “The gardens will be green space to use as a living laboratory for organic gardening, nutrition, diet and health education and to teach job-related skills. They’ll also provide places where people can grow food for themselves and their families,” said project manager Iris Peppard. On May 5, a commercial worm bin will be installed at the Chinatown Community Garden site as the first step in establishing a composting business. And some of the grant money will allow university service learning students to develop and deliver nutrition education programs at all three garden locations. Work has already started on the nutrition program that will take place at the Pueblo Del Mar kitchen. Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula has agreed to support 10 garden beds, and Hope Services and the Veterans Transition Center are exploring collaboration opportunities at the Shoreline Garden.
</p><p>The Chinatown garden – located on the corner of Soledad and Lake streets – is an island of fruits, flowers and vegetables that also serves as an employment center for some of the area’s most vulnerable residents. It has become a focal point for the renewal of Chinatown. The garden was established in 2006 through a job-training program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  
</p><h2>Professor Dan Fernandez among the speakers</h2><p>Dr. Dan Fernandez, chair of the Division of Science and Environmental Policy at CSUMB, will be among the speakers at TEDx Monterey on April 15 at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. The conference will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Dr. Fernandez will make his presentation about 2:15 p.m.
</p><p>This year’s theme is “Cultivating Innovation.” According to conference organizers, the lineup of speakers and presenters will be true to the TED promise of “riveting talks by remarkable people.”
</p><p>TEDx conferences take their name and format – which features notable speakers spotlighting “ideas worth spreading” in 18-minute segments – from the internationally renowned TED conference (Technology Education Design). The TED organization licenses local groups to organize their own events under the TEDx banner.
</p><p>Dr. Fernandez has taught physics at CSUMB since 1996. One of his research areas – and the subject of his TEDx presentation – involves extraction and measurement of water from fog.

</p><h3>Otters Jason Owen named Coach of the Year</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay's men's golf team won its second straight California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) championship on April 19 at Hunter Ranch Golf Course in Paso Robles. The Otters also took the top two places in the individual competition.
</p><p>The 12th-ranked Otters held off hard-charging Chico State to finish at 18-under-par 846 and win by two strokes. That’s the lowest score in the tournament’s eight years on the 6,421-yard, par-72 Hunter Ranch course.
</p><p>Top-ranked Chico State carded the day’s best round, an 11-under-par 277, for second place. No. 16 Cal State Stanislaus (+12) finished third, while 11th-ranked Sonoma State (+19) was fourth.
</p><p>Cal State San Bernardino (+23) finished fifth, UC San Diego (+31) sixth, Cal State East Bay (+40) seventh, and Cal State Dominguez Hills (+59) eighth.
</p><p>Team members Scott Yeakel and Oskar Nystrom, along with Chico State's Kyle Souza, needed a playoff to determine the individual champion. Souza was eliminated on the first playoff when both CSUMB players birdied. Yeakel drained a 10-foot birdie putt on the third hole to claim the title.
</p><p>John Jackson, last year's individual medalist, came in fourth with a 4-under-par 212 after carding six birdies in the final round. Dylan Jackson finished in 10th place with an even-par 216 total. D.J. Milligan tied for 22nd with a 8-over par 224.
</p><p>“When I took over this program three years ago, I told the guys that my dream is to finish 1-through-5,” said head coach Jason Owen. “We came close today with two guys tied for the lead, another guy fourth and another tied for 10th. Our program’s healthy and hopefully we can do this for many years to come.”
</p><p>This win marks the fourth straight tournament victory for the Otters heading into the NCAA Super Regional tournament May 2-4.
</p><p>At the conclusion of play, conference individual award winners were named. Coach of the Year honors went to Jason Owen of CSUMB. Kenny Pigman of CSU San Bernardino was Most Valuable Player; Freshman of the Year was Chris Doyle of Chico State; and Cody Thompson, also of Chico, was named Newcomer of the Year.
</p><p>Named to the All-Tournament team were: Patrick Bauer, Sonoma State Trevor Blair, Cal State Stanislaus Eric Fazzetta, Chico State Dylan Jackson, Cal State Monterey Bay John Jackson, Cal State Monterey Bay Oskar Nystrom, Cal State Monterey Bay Kenny Pigman, Cal State San Bernardino Teddy Schrior, Cal State Stanislaus Kyle Souza, Chico State Scott Yeakel, Cal State Monterey Bay
</p><h3>Princeton Review calls campus "environmentally responsible"</h3><p>California State University, Monterey Bay has been named one of the nation’s most environmentally responsible schools by the Princeton Review and the U.S. Green Building Council.
</p><p>The “Princeton Review’s Guide to 311 Green Colleges” profiles campuses that demonstrate notable commitments to sustainability in their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career preparation. The 2011 edition of the guide was released today, just two days prior to the April 22 celebration of Earth Day. And it is online only – to save trees.
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay was praised for its initiatives including the revolving Energy Innovations Fund that supports energy-saving projects on campus and repays itself through energy savings, and the 6.4-acre solar installation that is meeting 17 percent of the university’s electricity needs. Also drawing praise was the university’s food service operations, which include organic foods, compostable packaging and serving products, and recycling of cooking oil. All buildings on campus have designated recycling areas, and the ubiquity of the blue recycle bins has helped the university achieve a 50 percent waste diversion rate. The green learning opportunities, which allow students to take courses in subjects as diverse as environmental writing and food ethics, were also cited. The guide pointed out that CSU Monterey Bay's commitment to green continues all the way to graduation – when students cross the stage to receive their degrees in gowns sewn with material made from recycled plastic bottles. “It’s rewarding to be recognized for something that is so central to our university,” said President Dianne Harrison. “Sustainability is a core principle here. I hope this means that even more students who care about sustainability will find out about us and choose to study here.” Schools were chosen based on a 2010 survey the Princeton Review conducted of hundreds of colleges to tally its annual “Green Rating” scores for school profiles in its college guidebooks and website. The survey asked administrators more than 50 questions about their institution’s sustainability-related policies, practices and programs. Green Ratings were tallied for more than 700 institutions; those scoring 80 or above on a scale of 60 to 99 made the list.

</p><h2>Bold addition to Monterey History Maritime Museum</h2><p>A pair of CSU Monterey Bay alumni and six current students have joined forces with a renowned Southern California artist to add a colorful new look to the Monterey History and Maritime Museum at Custom House Plaza.
</p><p>Andre Miripolsky was hired by the Monterey History and Art Association to work on a “historama” inside the museum. He’s also painting a 275-foot mural – depicting a wave – on the fence that wraps around the building, with help from the eight CSUMB artists.
</p><p>Visual and Public Art students Katherine Webb, Crystal Taylor, Ashleigh Oxford, Elizabeth Ruhl, Jennifer Lucido and Michelle Beck are working on the project, along with VPA graduates Cristiano Colantoni and Margo Mullen.
</p><p>Colantoni was recently named curator of collections and exhibitions at the museum. He recruited Mullen and the students.
</p><p>“This mural is bold and dynamic and if you dare to use your imagination, it looks like the building is a boat, floating in the 'urban wave,' Mullen says on her blog.
</p><p>Mullen is best known on campus for her mural of a kelp forest at the university’s Aquatics Center.
</p><p>“I have longed for another mural project in Monterey; there are many naked walls in this town that could use a good coat,” she says on her blog. “I feel so happy to be a part of this project and I hope that this mural will be the catalyst for investing in innovative public art.”

</p><p>A team from Student Activities – known as the Rodents of Unusual Size – took home the Golden Shoe trophy for the top finish in this year’s Workplace Walk-off Challenge. The award was presented at a celebration on April 19 organized by Human Resources at the University Center.
</p><p>Kelly Mailly, Ajamu Lamumba, Linda Mendoza, Aron Casaday and Rick Dawson generated the most steps – 2,653,620 – to take the title. The trophy will be displayed in the Student Center until next year’s challenge begins.
</p><p>“We really had to ramp it up and keep it up in order to win,” said Mailly, the team captain. “We had a lot of consistency and I'm proud of our team,” she said at the awards presentation.
</p><p>The Rodents were one of 25 teams that participated in the fifth annual challenge, a one-month get-moving exercise competition geared to help employees make exercise a habit. The goal is for each participant to reach 10,000 steps a day, the recommended amount of daily exercise.
</p><p>Combined, the 125 participants in this year’s competition generated 36,587,414 steps – equivalent to 17,423 miles – between March 14 and April 10.
</p><p>Additional recognition went to Casaday for generating the most steps in the challenge; team Otter Slaughter (Dee Cockerham, Grace Cardenas Leal, Gladys Cabadas, Chrissy Lofgren and Tiffany Ward of ?Academic and Career Advising and Undergraduate Advising Center) for their overall team improvement; Leal for the best individual improvement; and the 75 participants who made the 10,000 Steps Club.
</p><p>New this year was the introduction of four awards determined by employee votes. In the end, The Lost Soles (David Ham, Lupe Cabeca, Jacinto Salazar III, Terri Wheeler and David Wittrock of ?Student Activities and Leadership Development, UPD, Service Learning and KAZU) earned Best Team Name; the FA Cartel (Diego Ortiz, Angeles Fuentes, Ashlie McCallon, Adriana Pacheco and Johanna Mahoney of ?Financial Aid) won Most Creative Team Photo; the Wylde Walkers (Natalie Lockwood, Laura Tantillo, Terryn Ashley, Karen Williams and Nancy Rogers? of Human Resources) earned the L.O.L. Team Photo award; and Otter Slaughter was awarded Best Overall Team Photo.
</p><p>Finding the motivation to make exercise a habit is challenging, but worth the effort.
</p><p>“Do it,” Mailly said. “Even if you aren't competitive, do it because it's fun no matter what level. It's not about winning, it's about being healthy and maintaining a balance of work and working out. We only get one body, so it's important to take care of it.”

</p><h3>Follow the Otters at the national championship May 17-20</h3><p>As soon as the members of the Otter men's golf team finished play in last year's NCAA Division II national championship -- where they placed 11th -- they started planning for this year’s title run.
</p><p>The planning and preparation paid off. A two-stroke win over runner-up Sonoma State in the Central/West Super Regional qualified CSUMB for a spot in the national championship, which kicks off May 17 at the Robert Trent Jones at the Shoals course in Florence, Ala. They will join 14 other teams in the chase for the national title. 
</p><p>“What an awesome day for CSUMB's Athletic Department, the university and the Monterey Bay community,” said head coach Jason Owen after his team won the super regional. “Five wins in a row is pretty impressive at any level but to do it at this level is amazing.”
</p><p>The Otters recorded a total of 9-under-par 855 to bring home CSUMB's first regional title.
</p><p>CSUMB entered the final round six strokes behind Sonoma State. The Otters shot 7-under-par 281 as a team Wednesday to beat the Seawolves by eight strokes.
</p><p>“I'm extremely pleased with the team's performance,” Owen said. “We did exactly what we set out to do.” 
</p><p>John Jackson (above) fired an 8-under-par 208 to take individual honors, the first CSUMB male golfer to win a regional tournament. In the final round, Jackson had a flawless performance with five birdies and 13 pars. He finished with 16 birdies in the 54-hole tournament. 
</p><p>Dylan Jackson tied for third with a 3-under 213.
</p><p>The Otters earned the No. 1 seed in the regional -- and a huge confidence boost -- after claiming their second straight California Collegiate Athletic Association title. Four Otters placed in the top 10, including medalist Scott Yeakel, Oskar Nystrom, John Jackson and Dylan Jackson. Coach Jason Owen was named CCAA coach of the year.
</p><p>Here's a wrap-up of the spring sports:
</p><p>• Baseball: Capping off its best season to date, the baseball team ended its season with a 6-3 victory over Cal State Dominguez Hills on May 8. 
</p><p>The Otters set a program record for wins in a season with a 21-28 overall mark; it also turned in a program-best California Collegiate Athletic Association record at 18-22.
</p><p>“I couldn't be more proud of this group of guys, and they have a lot to be proud of as well,” said first-year coach Walt White. “These guys have set the foundation for a very bright future here. Coming off a difficult 2010 season, this team learned how to compete together, believe in each other, and play selfless baseball. We grew as a team throughout the year.”
</p><p>• Softball: Catcher Shae Olds broke the CCAA career home run record with 44. She concluded her career at CSUMB with a .338 batting average, 194 hits, 73 runs, 20 doubles and two triples. She also batted in 153 runs in 574 at-bats. The team finished with a 24-27 overall record, 17-18 in conference.
</p><p>• Water polo: The women’s water polo team concluded its season with a seventh-place finish at the Western Water Polo Association tournament, the best finish ever for the Otters. For the season, Nikki Smart led the team with 114 goals, making her one of the top scorers in the nation. The team finished with an 18-20 record.
</p><p>• Volleyball: Local standout Julia Ashen has signed a letter of intent to join the Otters next fall. The 6-1 outside hitter was named player of the year by both local newspapers. She’ll join a team that finished sixth in CCAA play last fall with a 12-10 mark, 15-10 overall.

</p><h3>Prestigious program moves to campus in 2012</h3><p>California State University, Monterey Bay is the new home of CSU Summer Arts. Starting this summer, the annual month-long program offering academic credit plus a festival in the visual, performing, literary and new media arts, will be held at CSU Monterey Bay. It will be hosted by the Seaside campus for at least five years. "This is a tremendous vote of confidence in the breadth and quality of our arts programs," President Dianne Harrison said. "Summer Arts will offer unprecedented opportunities for our students and our communities."
</p><p>In April 2011, a committee of arts faculty members from throughout the CSU visited four campuses in the running to host the program. Fresno State, which has housed the program for the last 13 years, was considered, along with San Francisco State and Chico State.
</p><p>CSUMB was selected for several reasons, said Summer Arts Director Jim Spalding. “CSUMB’s arts programs are blossoming and that’s a good environment for Summer Arts,” Spalding said. He added that the committee was impressed with the university's connection to and support from its surrounding communities. “And the location is great," Spalding said. "I think our program works well in a smaller, community setting like this.” The academic component offers two sessions of two-week courses for students and professionals in creative writing, dance, music, film, video, theater, visual arts, design and new technology. Local high school, community college and university students, as well as international students, study with guest artists in intensive workshops and master classes. Students earn academic credit for their work. The other component of Summer Arts is a festival, open to the public. World-renowned guest artists offer performances, exhibits, concerts and lectures at affordable ticket prices. Guest artists have included The Second City, New York New Music Ensemble, Bebe Miller Dance Company, Bobby McFerrin, Jane Henson and the Muppets, San Francisco Mime Troupe and Edward Albee. Among artists scheduled to teach this summer at Fresno State are the Grammy Award-winning Kronos Quartet and Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Under the direction of Professor Renee Curry, CSU Monterey Bay submitted a proposal in December 2010, after a year of working with various campus departments and community partners to secure their support “I can’t tell you how exciting this is for us,” Dr. Curry said. “Local students will have premier summer opportunities to work in the arts with international artists. And students from around the state and beyond will also come to campus to take advantage of this opportunity." Summer Arts started 26 years ago and has been located at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Humboldt State, CSU Long Beach and Fresno State.

</p><h3>Student divers help local marine environment</h3><p>Divers from CSU Monterey Bay are helping the local marine environment while logging time toward their certification as scientific divers.
</p><p>Frank Degnan, CSUMB’s diving safety officer, worked with the Monterey Harbor Master’s office to have the university’s student divers help clean up the marina.
</p><p>The first dive was held on May 4. Four students – Kristina Beck, Adam Alfasso, Jordan Barry and Jason Adelaars – along with alumnus Alex Olson and faculty member Steve Moore brought up enough stuff to fill two large bins.
</p><p>“We found everything from plastic bottles to miscellaneous metal and pipes to large batteries,” said Degnan, who supported the divers from the surface along with staff from the harbor master’s office.
</p><p>The next clean-up dive is scheduled for May 19. Degnan would like to make it a weekly event, but that depends on student availability.
</p><p>Students also had an opportunity this semester to dive in the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s kelp tank, courtesy of the aquarium’s dive master.
</p><p>The university has had a recreational SCUBA program for some time. Starting in the spring of 2010, an additional level of rigor was added with the introduction of a research diving course offered through the Division of Science and Environmental Policy.
</p><p>Students enrolled in ENVS 295, Introduction to Scientific Diving, concurrently take a master diver class through the Kinesiology Department. Together, the courses contribute to the 100 hours of training for scientific divers required by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences.
</p><p>“It’s very exciting to have our new research diving program engaging with local communities like this,” said Dr. James Lindholm, the program’s director. “Any opportunity to get in the water with a specific task in mind advances our students’ abilities as research divers.”
</p><p>Students who completed the program are eligible for letters of reciprocity that will allow them to dive with other university programs and research organizations.
</p><p>“We’re interested in giving students tools – and scientific diving is a critical tool,” Dr. Lindholm said. “With scientific diving training on their resumes, our students will have a huge advantage when they look for a job.
</p><p>“It means they’ll be ready to work on day one.”

</p><h3>Monterey County Film Commission makes award</h3><p>Dominic Parisi is this year’s recipient of the $1,000 prize in the Monterey County Film Commission’s Film Student Scholarship and Awards Program.
</p><p>Parisi, who will be a senior in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, is from Glendora. He plans to use the grant to help with expenses for his capstone film, a documentary that looks at women who participate in roller derby.
</p><p>“Dominic intends to explore the complicated relationship between this women’s sport and feminist ideas,” said Caitlin Manning, a professor in the TAT Department.
</p><p>“Roller derby participants often conform to social norms that are oppressive to women, but many find the sport empowering to them as women,” Manning said. “This won’t be a puff piece on a trendy new sport. Dominic is getting at serious and interesting social issues in this documentary.”
</p><p>The award “really takes a big load off my shoulders,” Parisi said. “It’ll cover some production costs and allow me to purchase a camera that will enable more creative shots.”
</p><p>Manning described the aspiring film editor as “a teacher’s dream.”
</p><p>“He plugs away at his work quietly, comes for help when he needs it, and responds well to feedback,” she said. The Monterey County Film Commission scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County. Film commission board member Jeff Clark is the scholarship program chair. The scholarship was created in 2008 and has gone to CSUMB students each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo shared the inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez – who now works in the TAT Department as a media specialist – was the winner. Rachel Asendorf received the award in 2010.  
</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>CSU Monterey Bay’s mobile website, launched in June 2011, has won a top honor among universities, colleges and independent schools in the western United States.
</p><p>The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) awarded CSUMB a gold in its Awards of Excellence competition in the individual sub-website category. CSUMB beat out Stanford University’s School of Medicine and California State University’s 50th anniversary website for the top honor.
</p><p>This story was published in June 2011, when the site was launched:
</p><p> 
</p><p>Want a CSU Monterey Bay map and campus tour, university news and sports results at your fingertips?
</p><p>There’s a web app for that. CSUMB has just launched a mobile version of its website – complete with news, sports, event listings and dining hall hours – that can be accessed <a href="http://csumb.edu/mobile">here</a>. It’s simpler, faster and formatted for smaller screens. The mobile website is accessible via devices such as iPhone, Blackberry and Android-based smart phones and tablets using the devices’ built-in web browser. It includes tools designed to help the community as well as students, faculty and staff navigate campus information. Students find it especially useful since it allows them to check their class schedule and campus accounts, access the bus schedule and renew library books. Because a growing number of people – on and off campus – are accessing the web via handheld devices, CSUMB President Dianne Harrison thought it was essential to provide information in a format that would accommodate those users. CSUMB is now among the 9 percent of American colleges and universities that have mobile websites, according to the Mobile in Higher Education website. (Read the survey <a href="http://www.dmolsen.com/mobile-in-higher-ed/2011/02/01/results-from-higher-ed-mobile-website-tech-survey/">here</a>.) The mobile site was developed in-house by Kevin Miller and Greg Pool of the university’s Information Technology staff, with help from several students majoring in computer science, and Liz MacDonald and Kevin Garcia of the communications staff. It follows on the redesign and relaunch of the university's website, csumb.edu, in October 2010.
</p><p>For his accomplishments in the classroom, D.J. Milligan has been honored by the NCAA with this year's Elite 88 award for Division II golf. The award was presented May 15 in Florence, Ala., site of the national championship.
</p><p>The Elite 88 is presented to the student-athlete with the highest cumulative grade-point average participating in the national championship for each of the NCAA's sports. Milligan, a red-shirt junior majoring in business, carries a 3.98 GPA.
</p><p>Eligible student-athletes are sophomores or above who have participated in their sport for at least two years. 
</p><p>The Otters are making their second appearance at the NCAA Division II men's golf championship, set to run May 16-20. Last year, the team finished 11th among the field of 15.

</p><p>Scott Waltz, associate professor in the Liberal Studies Department, was honored at the annual teaching awards ceremony sponsored by the Community Foundation for Monterey County. This year’s event was held May 5 at the Embassy Suites hotel in Seaside.
</p><p>Dr. Waltz received the Allen Griffin Award for excellence in teaching at the post-secondary level. Faculty members from Monterey Peninsula College, Monterey Institute of International Studies, Defense Language Institute and Naval Postgraduate School were also honored, as were elementary, middle and high school teachers.
</p><p>Established in 1982, the Griffin Award was created by a bequest from the late Col. Allen Griffin, former publisher of the Monterey Herald and founder and former board president of the Community Foundation. The award honors teachers who have a record of sustained excellence in the classroom and who have made a significant impact in the community.
</p><p>Dr. Waltz joined CSU Monterey Bay in 2004 from D’Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y. He began his teaching career as an interpretive naturalist for elementary children, but moved on a few years later to pursue a master’s degree in the arts of teaching, and a teaching credential, at Beloit College in Wisconsin. After a stint as a high school teacher, he earned a Ph.D. in the Social Foundations of Education at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  
</p><p>The Arts Council for Monterey County will honor Enid Baxter Blader at its annual Champions of the Arts gala on Jan. 21.
</p><p>Associate professor and chair of CSU Monterey Bay’s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, she will be recognized in the education category. Other honorees are Beach Boys founding member Al Jardine (lifetime achievement award); Garland Thompson (luminary); Alisal Center for the Fine Arts (nonprofit); Eric and Teresa Del Piero (philanthropist); Mari Kloeppel (professional); and Sonia Chapa (volunteer).
</p><p>According to the Arts Council, the event is a “tribute to the great work and inspiring spirit of our champions.
</p><p>“We are proud to honor these exemplary leaders who have demonstrated such tremendous passion and commitment to the arts in Monterey County,” the council said.
</p><p>Professor Blader is an accomplished artist, musician and filmmaker with a diverse arts background. Her artworks have been shown at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; Location One in New York; the Sundance Film Festival; The Arclight Theater in Los Angeles; and in Vienna, London, Glasgow and Mallorca, among other locations.
</p><p>Among her recent projects is a book titled, Water, CA, which she co-edited with Nicole Antebi. The project (<a href="http://watercalifornia.org" title="http://watercalifornia.org">http://watercalifornia.org</a>) is also a touring museum exhibition showing at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena and the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento.
</p><p>In 2008, she founded the Monterey Bay Film Festival, and followed that with the Monterey Bay Film Society in 2010. Also in 2010, she was awarded a federal stimulus grant to fund an ongoing community program of film workshops for at-risk, incarcerated and migrant youth.
</p><p>Professor Blader earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from The Cooper Union in 1996, was a fellow at Yale University, and received her Master of Fine Arts with a fellowship from Claremont Graduate University in 2000.
</p><p>She is the third faculty member at CSUMB to be honored by the Arts Council, joining 2007 honoree Jennifer Colby and 2009 honoree Amalia Mesa-Bains.

</p><h2>University is only two-time top honoree in the nation</h2><p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received the Presidential Award as part of the 2010 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition a college or university can receive for its commitment to community service. 
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison (pictured at left in red jacket) received the award June 8 in New Orleans. Dr. Seth Pollack, director of CSUMB's Service Learning Institute, and Dr. Miguel Lopez, co-founder of the "Increase the Peace" initiative and a faculty member in Liberal Studies, also attended the awards ceremony.
</p><p>The Corporation for National and Community Service received applications from more than 850 colleges and universities. Only six received the Presidential Award.
</p><p>In 2006, the program’s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one of three recipients of the top award. It has been named to the Honor Roll each year since then.
</p><p>"Not only is service learning woven into our curriculum," President Harrison said, "it also is part of our university's ethos of engaging with and contributing to our surrounding communities." CSUMB was honored in the category of summer learning, highlighting its many programs that work with at-risk youth, providing young people opportunities to work alongside CSUMB students in strengthening their college readiness. The award specifically recognizes CSUMB’s Increase the Peace Summer Youth Leadership Program, which provides literacy, math and art classes for at-risk students at El Sausal Middle School in Salinas. The program works to strengthen students’ sense of pride and cultural identify through art and literature so they can reject harmful influences and continue on the path to college.
</p><p>Congressman Sam Farr noted that CSUMB is serving as a national example of community service, grounded in the spirit of helping others. “Demonstrating the best of our values of selflessness and compassion, I'm certain that this award will undoubtedly help promote and inspire volunteerism for the next generation of youth on the Central Coast,” Congressman Farr said in a prepared statement.
</p><p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB’s students enroll in service learning courses contributing more than 84,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies in the tri-county area. And service learning is an academic department, where issues of service, diversity, social justice and social responsibility are linked to the core curriculum. 
</p><p>“It’s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally and even internationally,” Dr.  Pollack said.
</p><p>“No other university in the country has made as significant a commitment to developing students’ capacity for service and social responsibility.” 
</p><p>“We have a very special program, and it feels great to be recognized as a national leader.”
</p><p>According to the Corporation and National and Community Service, honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors, including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the school’s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and measurable community outcomes as a result of the service. 
</p><p><strong>SERVICE LEARNING FACTS</strong>
</p><p><strong>Service Learning programs have included:</strong> • The Juvenile Hall Teen Film Festival had incarcerated youth, along with other students, produce films that were screened at a film festival. • The Return of the Natives Watershed Restoration project worked to turn urban dumping grounds into community parks. • CSUMB worked with the Monterey County Volunteer Tax Assistance Program (VITA) to provide free income tax preparation to lower-income families. • Through a partnership with the Monterey County Office of Employment Training, Alisal Center for the Fine Arts, and El Sausal Middle School, the university provided a seven-week literacy, math, and arts summer program for eighth-graders. • The Chinatown Renewal Project brought together students with Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino community organizations to assist in the revitalization of the historically rich, though economically blighted Chinatown neighborhood of Salinas.
</p><p><strong>Service in 2010</strong> • At least 2,809 students participated in community service through CSUMB’s community partnerships; 2,041 students were enrolled in service learning courses and worked with 240 schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies in the region. • Approximately 84,270 hours were donated by CSUMB students, staff, and faculty to their surrounding communities. <strong>CSUMB’s Impact in the Community</strong> • Construction of the Chinatown Community Learning Center, as well as a 30,000-square foot community garden. • Implementation of a job-training program for formerly homeless individuals. • Support for a silk-screening cooperative and a composting enterprise employing formerly homeless individuals. • Support to conduct oral history interviews with families in the neighborhood to collect and archive important historical information. • Support for the consolidation of homeless services in the Chinatown neighborhood. • Provided 250 hours of free income tax preparation, resulting in the return of nearly $100,000 to Monterey County residents. • More than 1,100 CSUMB students mentored 50,000 Salinas school children, who propagated and planted 200,000 native plants, removed thousands of pounds of trash, monitored water quality, and made videos and trail guides in the Creeks of Salinas parks. • At least 125 service-learning students were mentors for children in eight after-school programs; as a result, 98.6 percent of the children expressed a desire to attend college.

</p><p>In order to graduate, CSU Monterey Bay students in the Visual and Public Art Department create a capstone project – a sort of senior thesis of art. Mounted together, they form an exhibit open to the public. The capstone projects are the final capping of skills, knowledge, values and commitments of the individual students. In these projects, student artists have identified public themes and critical issues that are relevant to themselves and their audience. This year’s exhibit gathers 35 works in a show of creative force. The exhibit will open on Monday, May 16, with an artists’ reception at 6 p.m. in the Visual and Public Art Building (Bldg. 71). The public is invited. The art department is housed in buildings located at the intersection of Inter-Garrison Road and Fifth Avenue. An exhibit catalog can be found <a href="http://vpa2.csumb.edu/capstone/capstone2011/">here</a>. The work will be on display until the final capstone and medal ceremony, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Friday, May 20. The public is invited to this free event or to view the exhibit during normal business hours. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here.</a> The campuswide Capstone Festival will take place Thursday and Friday, May 19 and 20.

</p><h3>Grant one of 10 awarded nationally</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay's Small Business Development Center has received a grant to help the city of Salinas attract and create new jobs in the wake of the closure of Capital One, a large employer in the city.
</p><p>Confidential assistance, training, information and networking opportunities will be provided to new and existing businesses, helping them access resources such as wage subsidies and training grants that will facilitate the growth of jobs and skill improvement. “This grant will allow us to work directly with more nascent and existing companies to create new jobs in the region,” said Andrea Nield, associate director of the SBDC. “We are off and running, already working with local stakeholders and the Workforce Investment Board’s Rapid Response Team to create jobs and facilitate hiring of those being laid off at Capital One.”
</p><p>The Rapid Response Team includes representatives from the California Employment Development Department, Shoreline Workforce Development Services, the Monterey County One Stop Career Center, the Workforce Investment Board and the Small Business Development Center. How can the CSUMB SBDC help? By assisting local employers with adding new employees. According to a recent study, SBDC clients experienced six times the sales growth, and created 13 times the jobs of average businesses (see <a href="http://www.californiasbdc.org" title="www.californiasbdc.org">www.californiasbdc.org</a>). Also, 65 percent of the center’s clients are in the Salinas area. Plans are to move to 106 Lincoln St., where the city will provide a lease at $1 a year for three years. The U.S. Small Business Administration Portable Assistance Grant, one of 10 awarded nationally, is intended to provide assistance to small businesses in communities suffering from a major disaster or economic hardship brought about by corporate downsizing. The UC Merced Small Business Development Center Regional Network (UCM-SBDC) will provide support and fiscal oversight to the project while the CSUMB SBDC will implement the program in the Salinas Valley.
</p><p>As part of the grant, a special projects business adviser will be hired. The selected candidate will implement a comprehensive SBDC action strategy to catalize job growth in the small business community. Consultants are currently available to provide one-on-one consulting on-site at the individual businesses or at one of several outreach sites. All services are completely confidential with business consulting provided free of charge.
</p><p>“We are pleased to announce SBA funds will be used by CSU Monterey Bay SBDC to help increase the jobs available to the Capital One employees facing layoff,” said Diane Howerton, regional director of UC Merced’s SBDC.
</p><p>The CSUMB SBDC is a nationally accredited program, largely funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration that operates within the UC Merced Regional SBDC network serving Central California.
</p><p>As one of four CSU hosts in Central California, the CSUMB-SBDC’s importance to the network is demonstrated by its excellent results in this region. Under the leadership of Andrea Nield, associate director, the CSUMB-SBDC has generated more than $3.8 million in capital infusion, which assisted 27 businesses to open that created and/or retained 134 jobs.
</p><p>“With Ms. Nield’s track record, the use of the Portability Grant funds will be beneficial to the Salinas area impacted by the closing of the Capital One facility,” Howerton said.   
</p><p>"We don't want students to have to do another job. Their research is their job," said Matthew Subia, research coordinator at the CSUMB Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center. – <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Dec. 12, 2012
</p><p>More will be known about raccoons, striped skunks, bobcats, foxes and other mammals that live on former Fort Ord lands as the result of a study by CSUMB graduate student Bart Kowalski.
</p><p>Kowalski is mapping the distribution of these animals on lands managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management, the Army and the Fort Ord Reuse Authority as part of his master’s degree program in Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy at CSUMB.
</p><p>The largest share of the former Army base was deeded to the BLM, which manages it for multiple uses including “environmentally sensitive recreation.” His study will provide land managers with information on the factors that impact the distribution of these mammals.
</p><p>“If I find that areas with highly concentrated roads and trails are less likely to be used by a certain species, then the managers could take informed actions to limit the use of those trails,” Kowalski said.
</p><p>“Alternatively, they would have the knowledge of locations to open new trails with minimum impact to the mammals.”
</p><p>For his work, Kowalski is this year’s winner of the James W. Rote Grant for Research in Applied Sciences.
</p><p>In announcing the award, Dr. James Lindholm, the James Rote Professor of Marine Science and Policy at CSUMB, said:
</p><p>“In the spirit of James Rote’s long career at the interface of science and policy, Bart’s project provides a clear linkage between research and management of the natural world.”
</p><p>Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Rote held a variety of science advisory positions and helped draft environmental policy at the state and federal levels. He was instrumental in getting Monterey Bay designated as a National Marine Sanctuary.
</p><p>He joined the CSUMB faculty in 1995, and was a founding member of the university’s innovative interdisciplinary program linking natural science, physical science, technology, economics and policy. Illness forced him to retire in 1997. He died in 2006.
</p><p>The grant program is in its third year. The $2,000 award allows students to purchase equipment for their research projects; the equipment remains in the department for use by future students.
</p><p>Kowalski came to the United States in 1992 from his native Poland. After high school in Costa Mesa, he earned a bachelor’s degree at UC Santa Cruz.
</p><p>“I fell in love with the Central Coast, and after graduating, moved around between Santa Cruz and Point Reyes (Marin County),” he said. “When I decided to pursue a master’s degree, I wanted to stay in the area, so CSUMB was an attractive choice.”
</p><p>He is planning to graduate in fall 2011.
</p><p>Erin Stanfield won the first Rote Research Grant, which she used to buy equipment for her study of algae in Pinto Lake near Watsonville. Scott Toews was last year’s recipient. His grant was used to purchase equipment necessary for his research in the mechanisms that drive genetic diversity in Monterey Bay.  
</p><h3>Student-athletes toss in spare change for Make-A-Wish Foundation</h3><p>CSUMB’s Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) held its second annual Penny Wars throughout the school year, raising more than $1,500 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the official charity of NCAA Division II schools.
</p><p>Penny Wars was a competition among teams, but with a catch. Members of the university’s 12 teams (men’s and women’s cross country teams combined) earned points by depositing pennies in their teams’ jars.
</p><p>But, members of one team could sabotage another team by putting money other than pennies – like nickels, dimes and dollars – in their competition’s jars. The penny value of that money was subtracted from that team’s total.
</p><p>At the end of each week, the jars were collected and counted; the teams were updated with their standings as the school year progressed. The jars were at all CSUMB sporting events and in the Otter Athletic Office throughout the year.
</p><p>“This was a fun – and competitive – way to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation,” said SAAC President Carrie LaPonza, a senior math major. “This was a great way to get all our teams involved.”
</p><p>Women's basketball took top honors by raising $246.83; women's water polo and baseball were second and third, respectively.  
</p><h3>‘You are today’s celebrities,’ President Harrison tells graduates</h3><p>On a sunny, breezy morning, President Dianne Harrison shared a few pieces of advice with the 1,000 graduates of California State University, Monterey Bay, and told the stories of several of them.
</p><p>“Rather than bringing in an outside celebrity who really doesn’t know you, YOU, our graduates are today’s celebrities,” she told the graduates and a capacity crowd of 8,000 of their friends and family members, “and that’s the story I want the community to take away from today’s commencement.”
</p><p>She reminded students that graduation symbolizes not the conclusion of something but the commencement of all that awaits them.
</p><p>“There is no ‘do over’ button in life. But if we are fortunate, we have opportunities throughout our lives to make a strong new start – to take advantage of new pathways that present themselves,” Dr. Harrison said.
</p><p>Today is such a moment, she told the graduates, and so was the day they arrived at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>She shared the story of Jena Cleveland, who suffered from teachers’ low expectations until she arrived at CSUMB. At the university, she discovered the thrill of doing hands-on research, and is now headed to the Ph.D. program in molecular cell and developmental biology at UCLA.
</p><p>Alana Tweed was another of the students whose story was shared by President Harrison. Tweed, a business student, is the first in her family to attend college. She took advantage of the services offered through the Educational Opportunity Program on campus, took on leadership roles, spent a semester abroad, and did an internship at the Naval Postgraduate School that turned into a full-time position. She’ll pursue a master’s in business administration in the fall.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison also told the story of Sean Capistrano, a participant in the university’s Pay It Forward scholarship program. As part of that program, he mentored youngsters at the Boys and Girls Club while he, in turn, was mentored by a local business executive. Capistrano parlayed an internship with the local accounting firm of Hayashi and Wayland into a full-time job.
</p><p>Interspersed among the student stories were pieces of advice gleaned from Dr. Harrison’s own distinguished career, her experience as the mother of two college students as well as “what I have learned from you.” She summed up that advice near the end of her remarks:
</p><p>• Continue to develop the skills that allow you to act confidently • Be flexible, stay open to new pathways and take advantage of new opportunities when they present themselves • Stay engaged with your community and participate fully as citizens • Demonstrate courage and leadership, knowing you can overcome challenges • Always treat people with respect and appreciate our differences • Don’t ever stop reading, questioning and learning
</p><p>The ceremony opened with the traditional welcome in Spanish, Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese, delivered by members of the faculty. That was followed by the National Anthem – sung by Jonathan Bell, a music major and member of the graduating class.
</p><p>The morning’s first speaker was Scott Bell, winner of this year’s President’s Award for Exemplary Student Achievement.
</p><p>Bell told students to be mindful and take responsibility for their actions. “I think it’s a key component of happiness,” he said. He followed that with a reminder that “you don’t have to understand everything,” and acknowledged that he grapples with that concept. “In seeking to understand everything we encounter, we may overlook the true beauty and value of what lies in front of us.”
</p><p>He urged students to take risks. “Do one thing that scares you every day. Only by taking risks do we discover and overcome our limits and boundaries. . .”
</p><p>Bell will pursue a master’s degree in psychology at Sonoma State University in the fall, with the goal of going on to a Ph.D. program.
</p><p>Two faculty members were honored during the ceremony. Frances Payne Adler was awarded emeriti faculty status, acknowledging her distinguished service to the university. Dr. Scott Waltz was acknowledged for winning this year’s Griffin Award for outstanding teaching.
</p><p>John Short has been named police commander at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Short comes to the university from the Monterey Police Department, where he worked for 22 years. Most recently, he was the department’s training sergeant, responsible for creating, developing and scheduling training for officers as well as overseeing the hiring of new employees.
</p><p>A graduate of Monterey High School and Monterey Peninsula College, Short has extensive experience working with law enforcement agencies in Monterey County through various committees and programs. He speaks Spanish and Portuguese.
</p><p>As commander, he will oversee patrol operations, investigations and records and evidence. He replaces Earl Lawson, who was promoted to police chief last fall. “John understands that the police department is essential to ensuring a safe environment for students, employees and visitors and helping to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and personal growth,” Chief Lawson said.

</p><h3>Builder finds a niche – with help from the small business center at CSUMB</h3><p>Like many small business owners, Shawn Bakker was doing fine until the recession hit.
</p><p>“I’d just go from one job to the next,” said Bakker, who moved to Salinas from his native Colorado and founded his company, Bakker Construction, in 2008.
</p><p>A year later, he realized that he needed to be proactive in his approach, rather than simply react to the economy. That’s when his lender referred him to the Small Business Development Center at CSU Monterey Bay for help.
</p><p>Working with adviser Keith Holtaway, he developed strategies and refined tactics that resulted in a shift in his target market to home remodeling and improvements for small businesses.
</p><p>By September of 2010, Bakker had hired eight new employees and increased sales by over $800,000. He continues to work with the SDBC and expects to reach $1 million in business this year.
</p><p>For his success, Bakker has earned the 2011 Entrepreneurial Success Award from the SBDC’s regional office in Merced.
</p><p>Bakker is just one example of the impact the SBDC has had in the area.
</p><p>Since it opened its doors in late 2009, the center has provided 2,475 hours of service to more than 200 businesses. It has trained 500 people, created 41 jobs, assisted with the start-up of 11 businesses, helped its clients increase sales by nearly $2 million, and helped with nearly $1 million of capital infusion (from loans or owner investment).
</p><p>The center provides management and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the area long the Highway 101 corridor from Gilroy to King City. From offices in Gonzales, Salinas, Hollister and Gilroy, as well as the CSUMB campus, the center provides critical services to small business owners, helping to create and retain jobs in order to strengthen the local economy. 
</p><p>Help is available to develop business plans, secure financing, assist with marketing needs, set up financial systems, determine plans for expansion, project cash flow, identify technology needs and provide a variety of other services helpful to small businesses. In addition to the free one-on-one consulting, the center offers a variety of workshops and seminars. CSUMB’s center comes under the auspices of the University of California Merced’s SBDC regional network, a fully accredited and nationally recognized program. University faculty members make up about half of the 20 people available to give entrepreneurs free advice. “We’ve got quite a large skill set” of counselors, said Andrea Zeller-Nield, associate director of the center. Some of the counselors have knowledge of key local industries, such as wine and agriculture. To learn more, click <a href="http://csumb.edu/sbdc">here</a>.

</p><p>Forget the shiny red apple.
</p><p>Teachers throughout the 28th Assembly District were honored at a pancake breakfast hosted by Assemblyman Luis Alejo on May 21 at a Salinas elementary school.
</p><p>The event – Dia del Maestro or Day of the Teacher – recognized bilingual and bicultural teachers nominated by local school districts.
</p><p>“Teachers may well be the most under- appreciated and undervalued professionals in America today,”  Alejo said. “But when you ask successful people to name the most influential individual in their lives, teachers are named more than any other group.”
</p><p>Among the honorees was CSUMB alumnus Ignacio Ornelas, who earned a degree in Social and Behavioral Studies in 2001. He teaches history at a high school in Salinas.
</p><p>"CSUMB taught me about social justice, democratic participation and building a strong social network. These values inspired me to embark on a career that values humanity," he said.
</p><p>"Today, I am privileged to teach the next generation of leaders."
</p><p>He's doing that at Everett Alvarez High and at CSUMB, where he's an adjunct instructor of social and political histories of the United States.
</p><p>"Another value I always credit to CSUMB is the ambition to pursue graduate studies. I was taught by a diverse group of faculty who always promoted graduate school," he said.
</p><p>"I felt I would be a failure if I didn't complete a master's degree."
</p><p>Mission accomplished – he earned a teaching credential and a master's in political science at San Francisco State.
</p><p>He knows first-hand the impact education can have on an entire family, and can share that experience with his students.
</p><p>"My five younger sisters saw that they, too, could pursue higher learning and achieve academic success. One of my sisters has already graduated from college, three of them will graduate in June and the youngest is completing her freshman year – all at UC Santa Barbara."
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison has announced that nine faculty members have been granted tenure. The newly tenured faculty members and their departments:
</p><p>• Dr. Rebecca Bales, Social, Behavioral and Global Studies • Ms. Enid Blader, Teledramatic Arts and Technology • Dr. James Lindholm, Division of Science and Environmental Policy • Dr. Marc Los Huertos, Division of Science and Environmental Policy • Dr. Deanne Perez-Granados, Liberal Studies Department • Dr. Michael Scott, Mathematics and Statistics Department • Dr. Shigeko Sekine, School of World Languages and Cultures • Dr. Marylou Shockley, School of Business • Dr. Patsy Tinsley McGill, School of Business Along with tenure, Drs. Shockley and McGill were promoted to full professor. The others were promoted to associate professor. In addition, Dr. Kim Judson, Department of Health, Human Services and Public Policy; Dr. David Reichard and Dr. Ernest Stromberg, both of the Division of Humanities and Communication; and Dr. Rob Weisskirch, Liberal Studies Department, were promoted to full professor.  
</p><h3>Slough of Information</h3><p>The CSU Monterey Bay-based Camp SEA Lab is in its second decade of offering Science, Education and Adventure through summer programs in and around the Monterey Bay area. Local teachers, scientists and resource managers who were concerned about the lack of ocean-science education in schools started the non-profit in 2000. About 8,000 children have participated in Camp SEA Lab programs since then. The program works closely with Monterey Bay-area research institutions. Funding is provided by grants – the California Coastal Commission's Whale Tail Grant program and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are major supporters – and local contributors such as the Packard Foundation and the Community Foundation for Monterey County. The youngsters – most in grades five through eight – come from the Monterey Bay area, but a few come from other states and even other countries. They take part in three- or five-day programs, day camps or residential camps. During the school year, programs are offered for entire classes; during the summer, youngsters participate as individuals. Amity Wood, program director, says many of the children have never been to the Pacific Ocean before, and have never done the kinds of activities the program exposes them to: paddling a kayak in Elkhorn Slough; looking at plankton under a microscope; dissecting a squid; building a remotely-operated vehicle. For some of them, it’s an adventure that will change the way they look at the ocean, the environment and, just maybe it will change the way they view science. Says Wood: “The vast majority of kids who come through the program aren’t going to become marine scientists, but maybe they’re going to come away with a different outlook on the ocean and the environment. “They’re going to care about it,” she says. “And if they care about it, they’re going to do something about it.” This summer, the Science, Education and Adventure continue with a variety of day camps and residential camps held on the CSUMB campus, including several programs especially for teens 13 to 17 years old. Two of the programs are for girls only. Campers will have the opportunity to interact with women scientists while exploring careers in science.

</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As of September 2012, Lawrence is enrolled in a Ph.D. program in biology at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. Following his Kannapolis award, his Ph.D. program is fully funded.
</p><h3>Young researcher studies aging</h3><p>Growing up in a small Central Valley farming town, Marcus Lawrence spent his summers working at jobs involving physical labor. “It taught me to appreciate hard work and the outcomes produced from it,” he said.
</p><p>That lesson paid off at CSU Monterey Bay, where, through hard work, he discovered the allure of research.
</p><p>En route to earning a bachelor’s degree in kinesiology in 2010, Lawrence presented the results of his research at meetings of the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association.
</p><p>Kinesiology Professor Kent Adams said, “Hands down, Marcus is the best undergraduate I’ve ever worked with.”
</p><p>Now a graduate student at Appalachian State University, Lawrence has earned a prestigious fellowship funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that will allow him to work on problems associated with aging.
</p><p>“Aging has been an interest of mine since working with Dr. Adams,” Lawrence said. “I see the numbers of older adults growing – not only in the U.S. but around the world. This group will soon be costing our economy a lot of money for health care.
</p><p>“I’d like to help prevent this health care burden by finding ways to prevent or reduce age-related loss in function that older adults experience.”
</p><p>Called the Kannapolis Scholar Fellowship, the 15-month grant will support his work at Appalachian’s Department of Health, Leisure and Exercise Science, as well as research at the North Carolina Research Campus for two summers.
</p><p>“After I completed my first research study, I was hooked, and ever since then I have wanted to pursue a Ph.D.,” Lawrence said. “The training I will receive and the research collaboration I’ll be part of as a result of this fellowship will propel me to a top-tier doctoral program.”
</p><p>He’ll use the fellowship to study the effects of a plant substance from Uzbekistan and parts of Central Asia in mitigating muscle and strength loss that occurs with aging. He’ll prepare an extract from the plant Ajuga turkestanica, and then feed it to mice that are the equivalent of a 65-year-old human. Depending on the outcome of the study, the extract could then be tested on human volunteers.
</p><p>“Previous research has shown the plant extract increases strength in young animals and protein synthesis in muscle cells,” said Dr. Kevin Zwetsloot, one of Lawrence’s research mentors. “Those are two of the problems that occur with aging. We lose muscle when we get older – our ability to build protein decreases.”
</p><p>Lawrence said his goals are to earn a Ph.D., complete a post-doctoral training fellowship, and join the faculty at a university where he can teach and conduct research.
</p><p>“My research will continue to focus on ways to combat age-related diseases, but also to expand that to include ways to use exercise to help combat illnesses that are not age related, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.”
</p><p>He credits his experience at CSUMB with much of his success.
</p><p>“CSUMB was quite possibly the greatest thing to happen in my life,” Lawrence said. “I was accepted to larger – or what others might call more prestigious – universities, but none of them would have been as perfect for me. It was an ideal fit,” he said.
</p><p>“Dr. Kent Adams, Dr. Trish Sevene-Adams and Dr. Henrik Kibak are the reason I’m succeeding in the fashion I am now. And, I would not have been able to accomplish nearly as much were it not for UROC – the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center – and the opportunities it provided involving research, networking and disseminating results.”

</p><h3>Nonprofit Girls Inc. empowers teenagers</h3><p>Patty Fernandez directs an organization that inspires girls to be strong, smart and bold.
</p><p>She’s a good role model to those young girls of what empowered women can achieve if they believe in themselves.
</p><p>Fernandez has been involved with the Central Coast affiliate of Girls Inc. almost since it was established in 2001. The organization works with girls between 9 and 18; it has served more than 900 of them through 24 schools in six local cities.
</p><p>A 1999 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay with a degree in liberal studies, Fernandez started out as a volunteer mentor and eventually became the organization’s executive director.
</p><p>“I am so grateful the founders of Girls Inc. saw the need for girls to take a look at their options in life – to understand they have options – and created a program dedicated to young women so they could learn what to envision, to ask for, to hope for, to achieve,” she said.
</p><p>While most of the programs are held after school hours, a weeklong session is offered during the summer, called “Smart Choices.” More than 40 girls who are about to enter high school will head to CSUMB June 14-18. They’ll explore the university and learn about the requirements for attending college. They’ll also attend workshops that focus on healthy relationships, peer pressure, self-image, self-esteem and healthy eating habits.
</p><p>“Smart Choices enables girls from King City to Castroville to spend a week living on campus and experience college life. The goal is to expose them now, so they will be inspired to prepare themselves to go to college. We tell them: these are your choices, these are the classes you need to take, the decisions you need to make in life,” Fernandez told the Monterey Herald.
</p><p>“They get a taste of what they can have; it’s not out of reach. They can see it and touch it.” That’s significant because 95 percent of them will be the first in their families to go to college.  
</p><p>Anyone interested in exploring the confluence of art and science is invited to attend the summer session of CSU Monterey Bay’s Science Illustration program.
</p><p>Classes in marine science illustration and digital science illustration will be offered in a five-week session starting July 19.
</p><p>While this is the first time summer classes have been offered on the CSUMB campus – where the program moved in the fall of 2009 – they were available when the program was based at UC Santa Cruz.
</p><p>“Classes have been attended by people from the community, high school students, professional artists, art students who need a science elective, and elementary school teachers who want to develop science units for their classes,” said program director Ann Caudle.
</p><p>It’s also a good way to learn about the program.
</p><p>“People interested in applying to the year-long Science Illustration program and want to get a taste for what it is have also taken summer classes,” Caudle said. “A substantial number of our former summer students have successfully applied to our regular graduate program.”
</p><p>The summer classes are geared to a wide range of student levels. While there is a set curriculum, there is also one-on-one teaching. The beginner will get plenty of guidance and practical training.
</p><p>“I’ve seen amazing progress in just a few weeks,” Caudle said.
</p><p>Professionals or near-professionals can widen their skill sets, try new approaches and fine-tune their observation skills and the quality of their illustrations.
</p><p>The marine science class will explore marine subjects and their environment, using watercolor and mixed-media techniques. The digital science class will use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop in conjunction with traditional techniques. The goal is to make science accessible to everyone. No prior art or science experience is necessary.
</p><p>Both classes will be taught by Amadeo Bachar, an instructor in the regular program. Bachar is also a freelance artist whose clients include National Geographic, Scientific American and the California Department of Fish and Game.
</p><p>The fee for each class is $585. For more information, call (831) 582-4500. To download a registration form, click <a href="http://extended.csumb.edu/summer-2011.htm">here</a>.

</p><h3>University holds summer orientation sessions</h3><p>A generation ago, college orientation was a perfunctory event, focusing on getting the new students registered for classes.
</p><p>Now, universities, including CSU Monterey Bay, have made this annual ritual an important part of the student experience, and include a separate program for parents.
</p><p>Otter orientation sessions are being held in June, with events meant to showcase the campus to students who will enter in the fall. All six sessions – two for transfers, four for incoming freshmen – are at the maximum capacity of 200 students. The freshmen sessions also have had more than 300 family members in attendance.
</p><p>The sessions are designed to ensure a successful transition to CSUMB. Students have the opportunity to meet with an adviser, register for classes, and learn about the university and how to get involved with campus life. They are introduced to campus organizations, student government, living and learning opportunities, outdoor recreation and intramural sports. And they get information on academic services, such as tutoring and advising, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center.
</p><p>While students are learning about the various majors and student services, their parents and other family members have the opportunity to ask questions of a panel of campus representatives.
</p><p>Dr. Christine Erickson, dean of students, gave a short presentation called Parents as Partners: Together in Transition. She told the audience that the university treats students as adults, expects them to be responsible, accountable and capable, and to seek out and use the resources that are available to help them.
</p><p>“We need you to trust that we have your child’s best interests at heart,” Dr. Erickson said. And she reminded the audience that at CSUMB, “we really are committed to the success of each and every student.”
</p><p>Parents had questions about how their students could get a campus job (easily, using an online process), if skateboards are allowed on campus (yes), how housing assignments could be changed (only after the first two weeks, and only if space is available), and if cars are necessary (no, there’s good public transportation and car-pooling).
</p><p>New students will have the opportunity to make connections and get involved during Otter Days Aug. 19-21, and at the Club Showcase, which will be held in early September.

</p><p>?  
</p><p>Christopher Marcos and friends proved yet again that students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU Monterey Bay can excel on both sides of the stage.
</p><p>Marcos and former TAT students Erica Racz and Malinda DeRouen starred in the Western Stage’s recent production of the cult classic “Little Shop of Horrors.” The theater is located on the campus of Hartnell College in Salinas.
</p><p>Current students Melissa Woodrow and Tomas Reyes were also involved with the production, working behind the scenes.
</p><p>But TAT majors weren't the only CSUMB students involved in the production. Sydney Duncheon, a Global Studies major who has been involved in local theater for quite some time, also had a prominent role. 
</p><p>“Little Shop” tells the story of Seymour – played by Marcos – an awkward and shy floral shop clerk who discovers a strange plant after a solar eclipse and uses it to turn his waning fortunes around. Naming the plant Audrey II after a co-worker on whom he has a crush, he nurtures the plant with the only thing it will eat – his own blood.
</p><p>When the plant’s appetite grows to the point of needing human flesh to survive, Seymour must make a stark choice: Does he give in to the plant’s carnivorous desires or stand up to the insatiable extraterrestrial and save the world.
</p><p>And how does a giant, man-eating plant with a penchant for belting out Motown-inspired tunes come to life? Puppets, four of them, each representing a stage of the plant’s life.
</p><p>In addition to playing Seymour, Marcos had the added challenge of operating the smallest puppet himself. It required him to juggle two roles at the same time – no small trick. The other puppets were operated by people in non-acting roles.
</p><p>Racz and DeRouen had supporting roles in the production. As Chiffon and Ronnette, they functioned as participants in the action and a Greek Chorus outside it. Young, hip and smart, they were the only characters in the show who really knew what was going on.
</p><p>All five TAT alums and current students involved in the production used skills they learned at CSUMB. And the current students acquired additional skills that will help them when they return to campus in the fall.
</p><p>Marcos (Class of ’10), who starred in Pacific Repertory Theatre’s 2010 production of “All Shook Up,” where he played the lead role of an Elvis Presley-like character, said the sense of community and teamwork within a cast is something he learned at the university.
</p><p>DeRouen (‘05) has been acting with the Salinas company since 2002. That year, TWS’s Tom Humphrey came to CSUMB to direct A Winter’s Tale and suggested she audition for the company. She has grown to become a lead actor in some of its productions.
</p><p>Racz attended CSUMB from 1998 to 2000, and then ended up majoring in musical theater at the University of Northern Colorado. While at CSUMB, she was cast in the first theatrical productions staged at the university.
</p><p>“Although I learned a great deal doing student films, through various TAT classes I learned that my heart belonged on the stage,” she said. “If it hadn’t been for CSUMB, I would not have discovered my true passion.”
</p><p>Woodrow, who will graduate in December, has worked at TWS since 2007 in a variety of positions. This summer, she’s “the media marketing, PR and social networking go-to gal,” she said.
</p><p>“And, along with Tomas and our great company, I will do scenic, prop and light design for three shows in our new repertory program, 2x4BASH.”
</p><p>Reyes is also in his senior year. He works on sound design and engineering at TWS and does some acting.
</p><p>“Since I’m majoring in film at CSUMB, I can use the skills I’m learning at TWS in post-editing and field sound,” Reyes said.
</p><p>“With my capstone coming up in the fall, the Western Stage experience is helping make sure my skill set is prepared for the next semester.”
</p><p>Woodrow perhaps spoke for all of them when she said, “ My involvement with TWS has enhanced my learning at CSUMB. I’ve learned that collaboration and communication is key!
</p><p>“There is no other way to make a successful production run. All design/directorial elements grow from listening, hearing and seeing how others work.
</p><p>“I’m grateful for what I have learned and continue to learn at TWS. It’s made me think outside the box and explore the material from all angles,” Woodrow said.

</p><p>Jason Owen, CSUMB’s men's golf coach, will travel to Hershey, Pa., to compete in the PGA Professional National Championship June 26-29 while one of his players, sophomore Dylan Jackson, will tee it up in the USGA Amateur Public Links Championship June 27-July 2.
</p><p>The 44th PGA Professional National Championship, the premier event for PGA professionals, will be played at Hershey Country Club's East and West courses.
</p><p>A lot is on the line. The tournament winner will earn $75,000, get his name engraved on the Walter Hagen Cup and receive exemptions into six PGA Tour events over the next 12 months.
</p><p>The top 20 finishers will earn a spot in the 2011 PGA Championship, set for Aug. 11–14 at Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, Ga.
</p><p>Owen (above) made his PGA Professional National Championship debut last summer in French Lick, Ind., carding a 1-under-par 69 in the opening round at the Donald Ross Golf Course. He missed the cut after a 9-over-par 81 in the second round.

</p><h3>Former soldier searches for meaning in the American military experience</h3><p><em>It was on my third visit to Fort Ord while working on this book that I happened upon the paintings. I was riding my bike through yet another seemingly endless geometric arrangement of rows and rows of misshapen two-story barracks when suddenly a sunlit gallery of vibrantly colored faces appeared before me. Their haunting eyes followed me as I approached. It was a magnificent display that stopped me short. –</em> Ed Salven, in his book "The Soldier Factory: A Window" Thirty years after he was stationed at Fort Ord in the 1960s, Ed Salven returned to find a ghost town. Once a bustling military community of more than 30,000 soldiers, the Sixth Army Infantry Processing Center sat in silent decay. He was overwhelmed by recollections of his time here as a draftee. Those memories became the basis for "The Soldier Factory: A Window," a meditation on being part of the U.S. military machine at the height of the Vietnam War.
</p><p>His recollections – confronting questions of war, authority, self-worth, honor, loss and love – are accompanied by portraits of soldiers painted by students in CSUMB’s Visual and Public Art program (and from Monterey Peninsula College), artifacts from the first few years of the university’s existence. Faculty members Johanna Poethig and Stephanie Johnson were involved with the project.
</p><p>The portraits are familiar to everyone who spent time at CSUMB during the first decade of the university's existence. They honor not only the soldiers portrayed but all soldiers, and pay tribute to the area’s military history.
</p><p>“We ‘peopled’ the windows with the living history of the base,” said Amalia Mesa-Bains, who was chair of VPA at the time. “The theme was based on social theory about human geography and history. The concept that guided the project was one of excavating the geography of memory that lay beneath our feet.
</p><p>“Edward Soja and other theorists refer to the physical, social and geographic meaning of space, that no place is empty when we find it, and that there are ghosts when we arrive.”
</p><p>Students and faculty worked with Johnson and retired Col. Hank Hendrikson in interviewing family members of non-commissioned officers. Through these families, they got photographs and other mementoes to work from in creating the paintings.
</p><p>“We selected non-commissioned officers because they were more often the soldiers of color,” said Mesa-Bains, “and the stories of their lives were largely untold.” The project sought to respect military service, while highlighting the common soldier.
</p><p>“At that time, Seaside had a large African American population. Fort Ord was also a military base known as a ‘compassionate duty station,’ meaning that interracial families were safe here so its history was important to our diverse student population as well,” said Mesa-Bains.
</p><p>Done with acrylic paints on sheets of Tyvek (a paper used in outdoor construction and landscaping), many of the portraits had fallen victim to the elements or vandals by the time the buildings were razed.
</p><p>"The Soldier Factory: A Window" was released by George Braziller Publishers, Inc., $24.95, 160 pages, 51 color illustrations. Ed Salven was born in Hollywood. Educated at UCLA and London University, he owns a landscape design company in Malibu.
</p><p>CSUMB graduate Margo Mullen has just completed a public art project in Santa Cruz. Her canvas: a square traffic controller box located at the busy intersection of Soquel Avenue and Morrissey Boulevard.
</p><p>Mullen, best known on campus as the artist behind the mural at the Aquatic Center, was one of five artists chosen from 150 applicants to participate in phase two of the Outside the Box public art project.
</p><p>The project was part of an effort by the Santa Cruz County Parks Department to transform traffic control boxes in the region. The boxes house the equipment that operates traffic signals.
</p><p>Her tiny mural shows two robots, one red and the other yellow, holding hands. Their clasped hands form a heart. She was the only artist chosen for phase two who didn’t have to revise her proposed design. Her experience as a muralist helped, she said.
</p><p>Mullen told the <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_18355983?IADID=Search-www.santacruzsentinel.com-www.santacruzsentinel.com">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a> that the robots were “born” in Santa Cruz. They were created – literally – in a moment of darkness, when the power went out in her studio. She had watercolor paper, ink and a headlamp; with those tools, she created a series of robots.
</p><p>“They just happened,” she told the Sentinel. Featured on her business cards, they travel with her everywhere. “They’ve become my little friends.”
</p><p>The project took 26 hours over four days.
</p><p>According to her <a href="http://studiomargo.blogspot.com/2011/06/electric-box-robots-santa-cruz-margo.html">blog</a>, countless people said “thank-you,” “awesome” and “way to go” as they passed on foot, bicycle and in cars.
</p><p>“All I can say is, Thank-You, Santa Cruz.”
</p><p>CSUMB is home to Mullen’s first big project – a 100-foot by 16-foot depiction of a kelp forest.
</p><p>“Working as a lifeguard at the Aquatic Center and playing water polo left an impression on me,” she said in 2006. The Visual and Public Art major used it as her capstone project.
</p><p>She recently worked on a <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2011/apr/29/art-students-alums-work-mural">mural</a> at the Museum of Monterey – formerly the Monterey History and Maritime Museum – with Los Angeles artist Andre Miripolsk, and is currently working with painter John Pugh on a mural for the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk.

</p><p>“This award caps off an amazing year,” Owen said.
</p><p>“To achieve what we did, you have to have a team buy into your system, and that’s exactly what happened. It’s awesome to see all of the hard work pay off.”
</p><p>The Otters won the NCAA national title in May. The title – CSUMB's first national crown in any sport – capped a run of five straight tournament wins, followed by victories in the California Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and the NCAA West Regional.

</p><p>Dylan Jackson, John Jackson, Oskar Nystrom and Scott Yeakel earned All-CCAA selections; the Jacksons and Yeakel were named to the All-Region team; and Dylan Jackson and Yeakel earned All–America honors.
</p><p>   
</p><p>John Jackson was named to the 2011 All-Nicklaus team, announced last week by the Golf Coaches Association of America.
</p><p>Jackson was one of 24 golfers from the NCAA's three divisions, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and the National Junior College Athletic Association recognized for their outstanding play during the 2010-11 school year. Only four Division II players were recognized.
</p><p>The team was created in 2008, and is named for Jack Nicklaus, widely considered to be the greatest golfer ever. A long-time supporter of collegiate golf, Nicklaus was Big Ten and NCAA champion while a student at Ohio State University.
</p><p>The award is Jackson's latest honor since leading the Otters to their first NCAA Division II national title with a one-stroke victory that clinched a win over Lynn University in the championship match in May.
</p><p>He earned first team All-American honors after collecting five top-10 finishes, including three tournament victories topped by a Central/West Super Regional win in New Mexico.
</p><p>With at least 75 percent of teenagers owning cell phones, it’s no surprise that the devices are playing an important role in parenting.
</p><p>CSUMB’s Rob Weisskirch, a professor in the Liberal Studies Department, is among the researchers investigating how cell phones affect the parent-teen relationship.
</p><p>In a study reported online in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, a peer-reviewed journal published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Dr. Weisskirch found that the nature of the calls and who initiates them can affect the relationship.
</p><p>He told the New York Times: “What I found generally was that when adolescents are initiating the communication and are seeking out social support and guidance from their parents, then almost across the board they tend to have better reports of getting along with their parents.”
</p><p>But, “when the parents call and have a lot of communication around ‘what are you doing?’ or ‘who are you with?’ or when they’re angry at the child and upset or scared, the kids report more conflict in the family,” Dr. Weisskirch told the Times.
</p><p>Ultimately, his study shows, the phone is a tool that may augment the parent-teen relationship but doesn’t substitute for it.
</p><p>Dr. Weisskirch has been at CSUMB since 2001. He earned a Ph.D. in human development from the University of California, Davis, in 1999, a Master of Social Work degree from San Diego State University in 1994, a Clear Professional Multiple Subjects Teaching Credential from the University of California, Irvine, in 1992 and a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and minor in Spanish in 1991.
</p><p>He was a lecturer at CSU Fullerton from 1998 to 2001, a clinical social worker in family service agencies and foster care group homes, and as an elementary school teacher.
</p><p>His research interests are the effects of language brokering on children (i.e., when children acts as translators for parents and other adults), acculturation, and ethnic identity development. In addition, he studies the effect of technology on adolescent relationships.

</p><p>In early June, Marisa Morse of CSU Monterey Bay and seven other undergraduates from across the country arrived at the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience to participate in the lab's Research Experience for Undergraduates training program.
</p><p>Morse applied to the program with the help of Matt Subia, research coordinator at CSUMB’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC).
</p><p>UROC works to support faculty-student collaboration across all academic disciplines through training, research and professional development. Students come away from the UROC experience with a deeper appreciation of the research process, a thorough understanding of their curriculum content and a clearer pathway to graduate school and post-college job opportunities.
</p><p>Morse, who is majoring in Environmental Science, Technology and Policy, spent her 11 weeks at the Whitney Lab conducting research on biological pathways, data mining and gene expression.
</p><p>She and the other students also participated in workshops on scientific ethics and communication, and visited graduate departments on the Gainesville campus of the University of Florida to gain insights on how to apply for graduate school.
</p><p>They also took field trips to Florida's diverse aquatic ecosystems including the Florida Keys, inland freshwater springs, the Gulf Coast at Cedar Key and local beaches and marshes.
</p><p>The culminating event of their summer experience was a research symposium during which they described the results of their work in oral and poster presentations.
</p><p>This summer, with the help of UROC staff members, 51 CSUMB students spread out across the United States and internationally. Many, such as Morse, worked in labs on other university campuses and at research centers; one served as an intern for a member of the state Assembly; and about a dozen worked on research projects based at CSUMB.??
</p><p>And while most of them are majoring in science, 14 are pursuing degrees – and research topics – in psychology, social and behavioral sciences, human communication, business, music and kinesiology.

</p><p>Sathyan Sundaram, a research analyst with the office of Institutional Assessment and Research, will spend part of July attending a seminar near Washington, D.C.
</p><p>Sundaram has been selected for the annual National Summer Data Policy Institute, where he will learn about research methodologies using large national data sources.
</p><p>“The purpose of the institute is to develop survey analysis skills and learn about national surveys and data on higher education collected by federal agencies including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education,” he said.
</p><p>“These studies include surveys of college graduates reflecting back on their collegiate careers and studies tracking college students over time.”
</p><p>Sundaram hopes to use these national studies as a benchmark for comparison and to provide context for studies undertaken at CSUMB.
</p><p>“These studies will help to address common questions, such as ‘How are we doing versus our peers,’ and ‘what do these results mean,’” he said.
</p><p>He’ll also learn best practices for survey construction, administration and analysis, which can be applied to CSUMB’s studies.
</p><p>The seminar is sponsored by the Association for Institutional Research (AIR), a professional organization for people in his field. It will be held July 17-23 in Bethesda, Maryland. All costs will be covered by AIR.
</p><p>Sundaram earned a bachelor’s degree from Northwestern University and a master of arts from Ohio State University, both in political science.
</p><p>Before joining the staff at CSUMB in 2007, he taught political science at Lake Michigan College.
</p><p>“CSUMB is the first time I’ve worked on the administrative side,” he said. “I wanted to get into educational research at a relatively new institution that still faced some challenges.
</p><p>“I have enjoyed the variety of projects with which I’ve been involved: accreditation, surveys, assessments, building operational reports, modeling retention and graduation rates and comparative analysis,” he said.  
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison has been named to the Execuitve Board of California Campus Compact, a coalition of colleges and universities committed to civic engagement.

</p><p>Anyone signing up for Environmental Science, Technology and Policy 303 at CSU Monterey Bay had better like the outdoors.
</p><p>The syllabus lists “required hiking and camping equipment,” a hint as to what’s in store.
</p><p>During the spring semester, 19 hardy students signed up for the ENVS “California Transect” class and its accompanying two-week field course.
</p><p>The classroom component prepared them for what was to follow by introducing them to topics in California’s scientific and cultural history with an emphasis on human impacts on the landscape. They also learned about the political history of water use.
</p><p>Then, on June 1, the students – accompanied by three former students serving as volunteer teaching assistants, a trio of instructors (Fred Watson, Susan Alexander and Thor Anderson) and two kids – set off to apply what they’d learned in a real-world setting of “interdisciplinary science and social science interactions,” according to the syllabus.
</p><p>What they got was an up-close-and-personal view – here’s where that hiking and camping equipment came in – of a “transect” across California, including a 1,500-mile lap of the Sierra Nevada with side trips through some of California’s most spectacular landscapes.
</p><p>Their route took them through the Central Valley, Sequoia National Forest, the Kern Canyon, the Mojave Desert, Owens Valley, Whitney Portal, Death Valley National Park, Mono Lake, Inyo National Forest, Calaveras Big Trees, and several federally designated wilderness areas.
</p><p>They spent 14 nights in tents at campgrounds, a county educational facility and at primitive sites on federal land.
</p><p>They were looking at both the obvious and subtle connections among water, land and living things.
</p><p>“They studied plants, birds, mammals, invertebrates, weather, history, Native Americans, geography, geology, water, cultural diversity, art . . . you name it,” Dr. Watson said. "A lot of the learning originated with the students themselves, with each student giving a field presentation to their peers on a topic of their choice."
</p><p>Connecting all of this was a fabric provided by the instructors on the form and function of landscapes, how they came to be, how they are currently managed and how past and present decisions impact them.
</p><p>“And, they learned how to remain studious in challenging physical situations, and how to be a member of a large team at very close quarters,” Dr. Watson said.

</p><p>Two students in Luis Camara’s directing class have taken top honors in a New York-based film contest. The results were announced online July 7.
</p><p>Joey Blackburn won first place and a $1,000 prize in the most recent 360/365 Shorts contest sponsored by the George Eastman House Film Festival. Lauren Hurdle took third. Their work will be shown at the organization’s festival next May in Rochester, New York.
</p><p>Every three months, the contest organizers release a theme. Filmmakers have 12 weeks to produce a film that’s three minutes or less. Contestants capture their thoughts, imagination and interpretation of the theme and submit their films online. Three winners are then selected. In the most recent contest, the challenge was to “Go Green” by creating a film that incorporated the theme of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. The filmmakers had to: REDUCE the cast by having one actor play more than one role; REUSE the dialogue by having one line used twice; And RECYCLE a shot by having it appear at least three times. The winning entries can be seen <a href="http://film360365.com/shorts/award-winning-films">here</a>.
</p><p>“For the final project in TAT 341, I told the students they could make films under the guidelines of the 360/365 shorts contest so they could enter,” Professor Camara said. Many of them took the challenge.
</p><p>Blackburn’s short, “Pieces of War,” was described by the contest judges as “a game of chess like you’ve never see it before.” It's a thought-provoking look at the costly game of war, where players are little more than chess pieces.
</p><p>The 21-year-old senior from Paso Robles said that while he’d love to attend the festival next May, “I don’t think I’ll be able to because it will be my final semester and I’ll probably be putting the finishing touches on my Capstone.”
</p><p>Spending the $1,000 prize presented no such obstacle. “My plan is to sell my camera and then purchase a T3i camera and lenses,” he said.
</p><p>Blackburn added that he intends to submit the film to the Sundance Film Festival.
</p><p>Hurdle, a senior from Roseville, called her film “In Your Shoes.” It’s about “a man who treats his employees terribly. Finally, one stands up to him. That leads him to question himself and learn a huge lesson,” she said.
</p><p>Finances will likely prevent her from attending the festival next May.
</p><p>“I’ve never been to a film festival,” she said. “I think it would be awesome to see my film played. Luis told us that the most honest critique of a film is to see the expressions and reactions of the people who watch it for the first time.”

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay walked away with two awards for being “green” at the 2011 Higher Education Sustainability Conference. Now in its 10th year, the conference – held July 10-13 at Cal State Long Beach – is the only one of its kind in the state that brings together the California State University, the University of California and the California Community Colleges as well as private colleges and universities as both organizers and attendees.
</p><p>Mike Lerch, CSUMB’s associate director of facility services and operations, accepted the award for best practices in the energy retrofit category. CSUMB modified the operation of the Tanimura &amp; Antle library to reduce the amount of time air conditioning is required. That resulted in an energy savings of approximately 20 percent.
</p><p>“This is a great project because it exemplifies basic principles in thermodynamics and control theory and required no physical modifications to equipment,” Lerch said, “only reprogramming of computer sequences.”
</p><p>The university was also honored in a category that was added this year –campus-community partnerships.It honors projects that extend beyond campus boundaries and into the surrounding communities for opportunities and partnerships around sustainability efforts. CSUMB was recognized for the Chinatown Renewal Project in Salinas. Professor Dan Fernandez accepted the award. While the focus of the Chinatown project has been on neighborhood revitalization, sustainability has been a consistent theme. Among those projects: a community garden where organic food is grown; workshops on natural building techniques; a composting enterprise; a solar-energy-generating gazebo; and a vermiculture micro-enterprise.
</p><p>The conference is a system-wide exchange, aimed at fostering collaboration among campuses, governments, businesses and non-profit agencies. It enables staff, faculty and students to showcase best practices for sustainability, from curriculum to campus operations. More than 1,100 people attended.
</p><p>Rebecca Kersnar, a lecturer in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, and Megan Tolbert, the university’s transportation planner, represented CSUMB along with Lerch and Fernandez.
</p><h3>Collaboration with area community colleges to start next summer </h3><p>California State University, Monterey Bay is preparing to offer a bachelor’s degree in nursing. Pending approval from the regional accrediting body, the program will be available in summer 2012. The university is collaborating with established nursing programs at the four community colleges in the area – Monterey Peninsula, Hartnell, Cabrillo and Gavilan – in a unique way that avoids duplication of effort and waste of resources. Students will begin the program at one of the community colleges, spend several years in “blended” learning when they take classes at their community college and the university, and then finish their studies at CSU Monterey Bay. Along the way, they will receive an associate’s degree from their community college and a bachelor of science in nursing from CSUMB. The students will be prepared to work in positions beyond the traditional hospital – in home, community and public health settings. Their training will emphasize the relationships among patients, their families and communities, and health care providers. Students also will learn how to manage patients with multiple chronic conditions – addressing the needs of baby boomers. The program will accept 25 to 30 students each year. “Prospective students frequently ask us about a bachelor of nursing program,” Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe said. She also pointed out that there is strong community support – and need – for nurses with bachelor’s degrees. As many practicing nurses advance in their careers, they find it necessary to obtain a graduate degree. To facilitate that, it is critical to improve access to baccalaureate nursing education. Although the recession has caused some nurses to delay retirement, the U.S. Bureau of Health Professions projects demand will grow over the next decade.
</p><p>In California, the average age of nurses is 47 years; 45 percent are over 50. In Monterey County, the current workforce is even older – 69 percent are over 55, according to the county’s Workforce Investment Board healthcare industry labor market study. A grant from the Foundation for California Community Colleges/Nursing Investment Fund has supported planning.  
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay's online MBA program is now offering a second track for students without extensive management experience.
</p><p>The new track began in January as a pilot program and will now become an ongoing program with a full cohort of students. The curriculum mirrors the university’s original online MBA program, with a focus on global business, corporate leadership and technology, but includes more case studies for less experienced students to analyze and discuss. Aspiring leaders can now access the same dynamic learning opportunities as experienced executives, gaining essential knowledge, marketable skills and an expanded network as they hone their business acumen.
</p><p>The university will continue to offer its acclaimed online MBA program on a track for experienced executives. Since the program launched in 2009, participants have appreciated the opportunity to learn with fellow professionals who can contribute their own experiences to high-level discussions, challenging assignments and “real-time” case studies. Students stay with the same group, or cohort, throughout the two-year program, getting to know one another, gaining mutual respect and building career networks.
</p><p>“It is exciting to add a new track to our online MBA that allows a broader audience to be able to take advantage of this innovative education,” said Chris Hasegawa, dean of Extended Education and International Programs. “When students graduate, they are ready to move to the next step of their career armed with the knowledge and tools necessary for success.”
</p><p>The online MBA program is a selective, fixed-curriculum, graduate business program. Classes are developed to create a technology-rich learning experience delivered exclusively online, allowing access from around the globe. Students complete eight courses over the two years: one course at a time, for eight weeks, four times per year.
</p><p>Interested candidates should call 866-757-5172 or visit MBA.csumb.edu to learn more and start the application process. A supportive advisement team is ready to assist candidates from the beginning of the application process through to graduation.

</p><p>Sustainability is golden at California State University, Monterey Bay. The university has been awarded a gold rating for an outstanding job of going "green" in areas ranging from curriculum and construction to conservation of resources. – The Salinas Californian, Aug. 2, 2011
</p><p>Joey Blackurn, a film major at Cal State Monterey Bay, took top honors in the short film division in this year's 360/365 George Eastman House Film Festival in Rochester, N.Y., with his imaginative three-minute film, "Pieces of War." – Paso Robles Press, July 12, 2011
</p><p>Nearly four dozen CSUMB student-athletes earned California Collegiate Athletic Association All-Academic honors, a reminder that Otter success extended beyond the arean of athletic competition in 2010-11.
</p><p>A total of 451 student-athletes from the 12 conference institutions were named CCAA All–Academic winners, an average of 37 per school – putting CSUMB ahead of the curve with 47.
</p><p>“Being strong competitors in the classroom is one of Otter Athletics' top priorities,” said CSUMB Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.
</p><p>“We have stated this fact a number of times and we are proving that commitment with our actions, successes and awards. CSUMB and Otter Athletics are extremely proud of our student-athletes and their continued successful pursuit of academic 'victories.' ”
</p><p>Student-athletes must meet several stringent criteria to be eligible for CCAA All–Academic recognition, including being an active varsity letter winner in one of the 13 CCAA sports and accumulating a grade point average of at least 3.40 in a minimum of 24 credits during the academic year.
</p><p>Four Otters made the list with perfect 4.0 GPAs: golfer D.J. Milligan of Cedar Ridge; soccer player Ashley Rohde of Scotts Valley; cross country runner Hayley Tharp of San Jose; and baseball player Tyler Young of Aiea, Hawaii.
</p><p>Also noteworthy – the Otter triumvirate of James Albert of San Bernardino, Brenden Fripp of Santa Barbara and Brandon Ward of Riverside made CSUMB the only school to place three men's basketball players on the list.
</p><p>Overall, only UC San Diego (84) had more honorees than the Otters.  
</p><h3>Nursing scheduled to be added next summer</h3><p>Interested in a career in the Foreign Service, international business, education, or translation and interpretation? Do you want to be prepared to travel the world? Do you want to be able to communicate with peoples of other cultures?
</p><p>The School of World Languages and Cultures at CSU Monterey Bay now offers degree programs in Japanese and Spanish to help students accomplish those goals.
</p><p>The Bachelor of Arts in Japanese Language and Culture prepares students to be active participants in an increasingly interdependent world by developing literacy in global matters, multiculturalism and cultural diversity. Students come away with an impressive level of language proficiency, able to communicate effectively in Japanese with cultural knowledge in history, literature and social sciences.
</p><p>Students in the new Bachelor of Arts in Spanish attain an advanced level of proficiency in Spanish. They also acquire a reasonable understanding and knowledge of Hispanic cultures through the study of literature, history, art, social science and philosophy through courses taught in Spanish and English.

</p><p>Heather Kelley has been named a recipient of the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship for outstanding graduate students in the fields of marine biology and coastal resource management. The scholarships are presented annually by the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Kelley will enter the Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy master’s program at CSUMB in the fall.
</p><p>"I came to CSUMB for graduate school because I wanted to work on applied marine conservation issues at the intersection of technology and marine biology," Kelley said.
</p><p>Since January, she has worked with the university’s Institute for Applied Marine Ecology (IfAME), under the direction of Dr. James Lindholm.
</p><p>Her work on IfAME’s North Central Coast Marine Protected Areas monitoring project helped her secure the scholarship. “Heather’s proposal to NOAA leveraged her involvement in that project because several of our sample sites occur in the Monterey Bay and Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuaries,” Dr. Lindholm said.
</p><p>Another reason for coming to CSUMB after earning her undergraduate degree at UCLA was the emphasis on science communication. 
</p><p>"I believe there is a gap between the scientific research being conducted and what the public can easily access and understand. Training from CSUMB with a focus on science communications and technology will allow me to better interpret the research of scientists and engage public audiences in ocean conservation," she said. The scholarship will cover the cost of tuition and provide two years of salary to support her work on the project as she focuses on applying the data derived from remotely operated vehicles to the management of National Marine Sanctuaries. And it will cover the cost of at least one trip to New England to work with colleagues at the Stellwagen Bank NMS. “Heather is currently on a 36-day research cruise along the North Central Coast, where she has quickly established herself as a key member of our team,” Dr. Lindholm said. “The scholarship is a great opportunity for Heather and we can all expect great things from her in the coming years.” The Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program recognizes outstanding scholarship and encourages independent graduate level research in marine sciences — particularly by female and minority students.
</p><p>Congress authorized the program soon after Dr. Foster’s death in June 2000, as a means of honoring her life’s work as a marine scientist and contribution to the nation. The program is administered through NOAA’s Office of Education.

</p><p>Mik Benedek has been promoted to the position of general manager at KAZU 90.3, effective Aug. 1.
</p><p>Benedek, a 30-year veteran of local broadcasting, has been with the station since 2005 as director of underwriting.
</p><p>Prior to joining KAZU, the public radio station licensed to the University Corporation of CSU Monterey Bay, Benedek owned and operated local radio stations KMBY in the late 1990s and KHIP in the late 1980s. A resident of Aptos, he holds a bachelor of fine arts degree in film and television from New York University.
</p><p>"In Mik Benedek, KAZU has an experienced broadcaster who can maintain the station's strong momentum as the signature source of NPR programming for the Monterey Bay area," CSUMB President Dianne Harrison said.
</p><p>Benedek replaces Doug McKnight, who is retiring at the end of July. McKnight joined the station in 2004 as assistant general manager and development director, then moved into the general manager position in 2008.
</p><p>"I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue building a great radio station that serves the Monterey Bay area," Benedek said.
</p><p>His student-athletes usually take center stage, but CSUMB’s Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal recently took a bit of the spotlight himself, bringing more national recognition to the Otter program by being named to the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) executive committee.
</p><p>NACDA is the professional and educational association for more than 6,500 college athletics administrators at more than 1,600 institutions throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</p><p>“To be able to serve in this capacity and represent Cal State Monterey Bay on a national level is a great honor,” said Otoupal, who becomes just the ninth California Collegiate Athletic Association administrator to sit on the committee.
</p><p>“The support of our university leadership is an important part of Otter Athletics' success and I thank them for that. This is another 'victory' for CSUMB. I look forward to making a positive impact on the future of intercollegiate athletics and learning ways to better serve CSUMB.”
</p><p>Said UCLA Director of Athletics and incoming NACDA president Dan Guerrero: “The NACDA Executive Committee continually features some of the best administrators in college athletics. The recent addition Vince Otoupal carries on the strong tradition and legacy of outstanding leadership in this prestigious group.”
</p><p>Otoupal will serve a term that runs through 2015.  
</p><h3>Rhythms from Cuba and Brazil, social action writing are among classes offered</h3><p>CSU Summer Arts returns to the Monterey Bay campus with a lineup of 16 classes, including two coordinated by CSUMB faculty members.
</p><p>Courses are two weeks long; some start on June 27, others begin on July 14. Students study with well&#45;known master teachers in dance, creative writing, filmmaking and videography, music, new media, theater and visual arts.

</p><p><strong>Accrediting commission cites grad rate, student success</strong> ? The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Accrediting Commission on Senior Colleges &amp; Universities has reaffirmed its accreditation of CSU Monterey Bay through 2019, President Dianne Harrison has announced.
</p><p>The outcome signifies that the university remains in good academic standing, and its students will continue to be eligible for federal financial aid. "The WASC reaffirmation is a major vote of confidence in our academic programs and our commitment to student success," President Harrison said. "The commission said our resources are strongly aligned with our strategic goals and priorities, and that is especially important in this challenging economic environment."
</p><p>?As a new institution, CSU Monterey Bay received its initial WASC accreditation in 2003. The current action is the university’s first re-affirmation of the initial accreditation. The re-affirmation process took several years, and included two site visits from WASC reviewers. For each visit, the campus prepared extensive reports documenting the work it has done that pertains to the WASC criteria for accreditation. The first visit, known as the “Capacity and Preparatory Review,” took place in September of 2009. The second WASC visit focused on “Educational Effectiveness,” and that occurred in March 2011. The visiting team then presented its report to the WASC Accrediting Commission, which rendered its final decision regarding accreditation status this month. Both the visiting team and the commission commended the university for accomplishments in several key areas. After its March 2011 visit, the WASC visiting team concluded that “CSUMB is an active and dynamic institution that continues to embrace its vision, adapt to its environment, and plan for the future. Administrators, faculty and staff are invested in student learning and are committed to the institutional vision. Student success appears to be paramount, and decision-making is founded on what is perceived to be the best for the students.” The visiting team commended the campus for “improving processes that have dramatically affected student retention.” The commission particularly valued the university’s “dynamism, adaptation, and planning that have taken place during this comprehensive review.” The commission also highlighted recent work on improving graduation and retention rates. “There was real appreciation and commendation by the site visiting team and the commission regarding CSU Monterey Bay’s progress since its initial accreditation," stated WASC President Ralph Wolff. "It is clear that the entire campus is deeply engaged in its educational effectiveness efforts and is focused on student learning.”
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay has been honored as among the best campuses in the country at helping migrant students succeed in college.
</p><p>The university’s College Assistance Migrant Program, a federally funded project designed to help students from migrant farm worker families pursue higher education, has been named one of the top 10 at helping them complete the first year of university studies.
</p><p>In 2009-10, 98 percent of CAMP students – 64 of 65 – successfully completed the academic year. Only five schools in the country had a higher success rate. And of those 65 participants, 58 enrolled for their sophomore years, beating the national target in that category by four percentage points.
</p><p>When efficiency and effectiveness were considered, CSUMB ranked among the top three schools nationwide in the dollar amount spent to provide services.
</p><p>The students in CSUMB’s program come from Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara counties.
</p><p>CAMP has been around since 1972 and has helped over 20,000 students accomplish their goals. The program offers pre-college transition and first-year support services to help students develop the skills needed to stay in school and graduate.
</p><p>Services include help with admissions, financial aid and other university services, parent orientations, high school and community outreach events, and summer orientation programs.
</p><p>Carrie Gonzales-Lujan, coordinator of the CAMP program at CSUMB, attended the annual U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Migrant Education annual directors meeting in Alexandria, Va., in mid-July. She brought news of the university’s national ranking with her when she returned to campus.
</p><p>"The directors meeting is a great opportunity for all CAMP projects to meet directly with the Office Of Migrant Education directors and staff," Gonzales-Lujan said. "It allows us to ask direct 'how to' questions about services and eligibility and to look at best practices.
</p><p>"The first year I attended was 2008. When I saw the Top 10 list I said to myself, 'CSUMB CAMP will be on that list one day.' And we made it in the third year. It is exciting to see our program succeed tremendously in such a short time."

</p><p>Kids 12 and under are invited to attend a soccer clinic at CSU Monterey on Saturday, Aug. 13. Members of the university’s men’s and women’s teams will host the free event.
</p><p>The clinic is part of the Otter Pups program, CSU Monterey Bay Athletics’ youth outreach arm.
</p><p>“This is a great opportunity for area kids to come out and learn the fundamentals of soccer from NCAA coaches and student-athletes,” said Rob Cummings, head men’s soccer coach.
</p><p>“It’s also a nice bridge between the campus and the youth soccer community as we try and forge those relationships, especially with two new soccer coaches.”
</p><p>Cummings will have members of his team on hand for the clinic as will Erin Reinke, the first-year head of the Otter women’s team.
</p><p>The clinic runs from 9 to 11 a.m. at the Otter Soccer Complex. Registration is required and can be completed <a href="http://www.otterathletics.com/sports/2011/8/1/OtterPups_FreeClinics.aspx?id=249">here</a>.

</p><p>When the <a href="//www.2011proworlds.com/">2011 Pro Disc Golf World Championships</a> tee off on Aug. 9, it will mark the tournament’s return to California after a 30-year absence. This time, the <a href="//www.2011proworlds.com/courses/csumb/">Oaks Course</a> at CSU Monterey Bay is one of four Monterey Bay courses that will host tournament rounds.
</p><p>Spectators are invited. Play at CSUMB will be held Tuesday through Friday with 10 a.m. shotgun starts daily (except Thursday, when play will start at 9:30 a.m.). For tee times, click <a href="http://www.2011proworlds.com/results/">here</a>. 
</p><p>Since championship-level play requires 27-hole courses, nine holes of the Cypress Course will be used in addition to the Oaks Course.
</p><p>According to Greg Pool, adviser to the campus disc golf club, spectators will get a good view of the action on the nine Cypress Course holes by parking at the Alumni and Visitors Center and crossing Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard.
</p><p>More than 430 disc golfers, including four former world champions, will be in the field for the five-day event. They’ll be competing for more than $100,000 in prize money.
</p><p>The field includes 55 international players from 14 countries including Sweden, Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Japan, Taiwan and New Zealand.
</p><p>Other courses to be used include Ryan Ranch, located off Highway 68 in Monterey; Pinto Lake in Watsonville; and DeLaveaga in Santa Cruz. The tournament’s semifinals and finals will be held on Aug. 13 at Pinto Lake.
</p><p>In preparation for the event, the university’s Disc Golf Club worked with Campus Planning to build 27 circular concrete tee pads on the Oaks course and part of the Cypress course. The new tee pads elevate the university’s two courses to a championship level.
</p><p>Disc golf has a long history at CSUMB. In 1998, students Scott Keasey and Steve Bonar got tired to driving to Santa Cruz to play.
</p><p>They started the CSUMB Disc Golf Club to generate interest in the construction of a disc golf course on campus. "We got eight names on a list and the school gave us $100 to start the club," Keasey said a few years later. "We then tried to think of ways to finance the course."
</p><p>While doing research, the two realized that one of the major manufacturers of disc golf equipment, the Disc Golf Association, was located right up the road in Watsonville. The two students also found that the driving force behind the Disc Golf Association was "Steady Ed" Headrick, the man who designed the modern Frisbee for Wham-O, invented the Pole Hole (the basket used in courses around the country), and an accomplished course designer with over 200 courses to his credit.
</p><p>Headrick agreed to loan the students the materials to create a course on one condition: that they sell his discs exclusively at the course, slowly paying him off with the revenue generated from the disc sales. Headrick also helped Keasey and Bonar design and build the Cypress course. Headrick died in 2002.
</p><p>The Oaks Course, in the live oak and shrubs on the southern edge of campus, began in November 2003 and permanent baskets were in place starting in 2005.
</p><p>Since 2002, students have been able to take a one-unit class in disc golf – Kinesiology 141. First taught by Stancil Johnson, the course is now handled by Merle Witvoet.
</p><p>The syllabus describes the class this way: “Low-impact and easy to learn, provides students with the fundamental skills, beginning through advanced, to enjoy disc golf. Students, athletic or not, all genders and all ages, can learn to play, and develop a life sport.” That description entices about 50 students to enroll each semester.

</p><h3>Learn how to build momentum with lean resources</h3><p>City managers, elected officials and professionals who serve the business community are invited to learn how they can leverage existing opportunities and pool resources to everyone’s benefit when CSU Monterey Bay hosts the Collaborative Economic Development Summit on Aug. 17.
</p><p>The event is part of a statewide series to highlight how collaborative efforts can generate economic growth and business development and is sponsored by the Small Business Development Center at CSU Monterey Bay and the Central Coast SBDC. The day will start with a simulcast feed from Fresno, which features a discussion of economic successes. Nancy Lublin, founder of Dress for Success and CEO of DoSomething.org, will be the featured speaker. Her topic: how economic development professionals can leverage existing – and diminishing – resources by working together. A panel discussion with representatives from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, the Central Valley Business Incubator and Fresno State University will explore best practices to generate economic growth using minimal resources. After the simulcast, a complimentary lunch will be served. During lunch, Congressman Sam Farr and CSUMB President Dianne Harrison will speak, followed by a “guided matchmaking” session intended to raise awareness of opportunities for leveraging efforts. The free event will get under way at 8:30 a.m. at the Alumni and Visitors Center, on the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Inter-Garrison Road. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h3>University ‘grows its own’ with on-campus placement</h3><p>When Veronica Gonzalez, who counsels young people in her job at Monterey County’s Division of Behavioral Health, heard about the opportunity to earn a master’s degree in social work at CSU Monterey Bay, she was eager to sign up.
</p><p>Gonzalez (at left) was among the first group of students accepted into the program when it started in the fall of 2010. Now those students are about to start their internships as part of the second-year curriculum.
</p><p>Gonzalez will work with the university’s Personal Growth and Counseling Center (PGCC). She chose that location in part because she’s an alumna of CSUMB and liked the idea of helping students.
</p><p>"After going through the interview process, I knew that the PGCC was the perfect match for me," Gonzalez said.
</p><p>Caroline Haskell, director of health and wellness services and founding director of the PGCC, said Gonzalez will work just like a therapist. “She’ll have a caseload.
</p><p>“We’re growing our own,” Haskell said, adding that the PGCC has provided field-placement opportunities to students from Sacramento State, San Jose State and several other universities for more than a decade. She’s pleased to provide the same opportunity to CSUMB’s graduate students.
</p><p>Most of the internships – called field practicums – are with the program’s community partners. They include the Kinship Center, Interim, Inc., Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula and various public agencies in Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.
</p><p>“Our community partners helped us develop the program,” said Dr. Mayleen True, director of the MSW program. “Now, they’ll have the opportunity to prepare our students to become culturally competent social work professionals.”
</p><p>Dr. True (at right) added that many of the agencies prefer advanced-year students, but “they agreed to take our foundation-year students to support the new program. This is a great indication of the strong university-community partnership.”
</p><p>The partners will have the opportunity to provide feedback to the MSW faculty. “They can tell us if the students are getting trained the way they wanted or expected,” said Vivienne Orgel, the program’s outreach, recruitment and admissions coordinator.
</p><p>There has long been a need for people with MSW degrees in the region. Before the university even opened its doors in 1995, discussions were held about establishing a social work program. A number of obstacles intervened.
</p><p>But with the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, funding became available. The Mental Health Services Act added a 1 percent tax on personal incomes over $1 million. The money is funneled to county mental health programs, and some is earmarked for workforce development. The Southern Bay Area Collaboratives and the Monterey County Behavioral Health Division directed $630,000 of that money to support development of the university’s MSW program.
</p><p>The three-year program allows students to concentrate in Behavioral Health or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year. They will spend an academic year in each of their internship placements.
</p><p>Gonzalez is eager to start her year of service to CSUMB students.
</p><p>"The Personal Growth and Counseling Center provides great services to students and their way of doing business goes hand-in-hand with my professional ethics and style.
</p><p>"I think this internship position is going to allow me to build on my social work skills, allow me to learn new therapeutic skills and allow me to work with a diverse population of young adults," she said.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The three&#45;story atrium in the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library at California State University, Monterey Bay has been named in honor of philanthropists Linda and Michael Dorn and their support of the Pay It Forward scholarship and mentoring program.
</p><p>Three&#45;dimensional silver letters on a balcony wall above the atrium walkway, which designate the space as the “Linda and Michael Dorn Pay It Forward Atrium,” were unveiled by President Dianne Harrison in a ceremony on Monday afternoon, Aug. 15.
</p><p>Pay It Forward provides $5,000 a year for four years and guidance from a mentor to selected incoming students from Monterey County high schools, who in turn are asked to “pay it forward” by mentoring youngsters at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Monterey County and The First Tee of Monterey County. The program now has 40 students and 40 mentors, with a goal of doubling that in the next two years.
</p><p>The atrium naming is recognition of the Dorns’ generosity and leadership in helping to develop Pay It Forward and Executives&#45;in&#45;Residence, an umbrella program that engages community leaders in addressing social issues, said President Dianne Harrison.
</p><p>“Mike and Linda have a philosophy of giving,” Harrison told an audience of friends and supporters in the library atrium. “They both believe it is essential to invest in the communities where they live, whether full&#45;time or part&#45;time.
</p><p>“They have a history of doing that, and they continue to do that in Monterey County.”
</p><p>The Dorns, who have a home in Pebble Beach, have been successful home builders in the Green Valley area south of Tucson, Arizona, where they also have been leading supporters of an organization to help older adults continue living in their own homes.
</p><p>Jim Bracher, a longtime leadership consultant who established Executives&#45;in&#45;Residence and Pay It Forward at CSU Monterey Bay, said the Dorns were instrumental in the establishment and success of both efforts.
</p><p>Their work will continue to pay dividends long into the future, Bracher said.
</p><p>“You are strengthening this community with every ‘pay it forward’ action that emerges because of your inspiring vision of what can be done to make lives better,” he said.
</p><p>The Dorns stepped forward to fund the first Pay It Forward scholarships, and Linda Dorn suggested the name, inspired by a 2000 film that portrays the compounding power of generosity.
</p><p>Speaking at Monday’s naming ceremony, Mike Dorn became emotional as he described a brush with death from polio as a 15&#45;year&#45;old during the polio epidemic of 1955. Two other men with polio were in the hospital room with him, he said, and both died within a short period.
</p><p>“I said, ‘God, please help me,’” Dorn recalled. “I made a lot of promises, and He gave me the greatest gift He could give me, and that’s life. That’s why we have been so much involved with things like this.”
</p><p>He pledged that he and his wife would continue their support of Pay It Forward, and he called on others to do likewise, laying out a goal for the program to eventually serve as many as 1,000 students.
</p><p>Dorn said Pay It Forward’s combination of scholarships with mentoring sets it apart from other programs designed to help less advantaged students.
</p><p>“You combine the cash with the mentoring, and you’ve got success,” he said. “That’s what it’s all about.”
</p><p>Pay It Forward students who spoke at Monday’s event underscored that point, describing what the program has meant to them.
</p><p>Ashley Rojas, a junior majoring in Collaborative Health and Human Services, said her mentor, Dr. Suzi Brauner&#45;Tatum, a social worker at Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, had helped her see that she has “no limits in life.”
</p><p>“Suzi has made such a positive impact in my life here at CSUMB that I wouldn’t be the same without her,” Rojas said.
</p><p>Pay It Forward recipient Sean Capistrano, who graduated cum laude in May with a bachelor’s degree in business, also credited his mentor, Jack Davis, and thanked the Dorns for being “pioneers” of Pay It Forward.
</p><p>“Pay It Forward undoubtedly sculpted me into a better person overall,” Capistrano said, “as I am more driven to be part of the change to better my community, not only for me but for my family … .”
</p><p>Capistrano, who is employed by the Hayashi &amp; Wayland accounting firm in Salinas and is preparing to take the CPA exam, made good on his words by contributing a check to Pay It Forward as he concluded his remarks.
</p><p>“Nothing would have gotten in the way of my climb toward graduation,” Capistrano said, “but without Pay It Forward, the ladder would have been drastically different.”
</p><p>Kevin Miller, Dr. Kathy Cruz-Uribe and Dr. Ilene Feinman were honored for their leadership and dedication to the CSU Monterey Bay Vision at the Day of Welcome gathering Aug. 17 in the World Theater.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison welcomed the campus community back for the fall semester, delivered her annual State of the University address, and then introduced the President’s Medal recipients.
</p><p>Last spring, the university community was invited to make nominations, and then a committee selected finalists for Dr. Harrison’s consideration.
</p><p>The nominees represented a cross-section of campus – some have a long history at the university, others joined more recently; some have direct contact with students, others have an operational focus.
</p><p>Miller, web programming specialist in Information Technology, was the staff recipient of the President’s Medal. His colleagues expressed awe at his ability to solve complex problems, communicate effectively and assert a natural leadership style that is heightened by an affable personality.
</p><p>In the past year, Miller was instrumental in the redesign of the university’s website, including the innovative and cost-effective use of open-source content-management software; the launch of a new mobile site; the continued evolution of the MyCSUMB interface; and online voting tools for the Associated Students election.
</p><p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe, provost and vice president for academic affairs, earned the President’s Medal for administrators. Her colleagues expressed their admiration for someone who applies a rare combination of talents and abilities in dedicated pursuit of continuous improvement for the university.
</p><p>Her leadership played a significant role in the university’s progress in many important areas, including the reaffirmation of the university’s accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC); general education reform, retention and graduation, strategic planning and program review.
</p><p>Dr. Feinman (at right) was awarded the faculty medal. The quality described by her nominators was leadership – the ability to bring people together to solve complex problems, find consensus and make a decision. That leadership includes mentoring – to colleagues and students – and is communicated with humility and humor. As chair of the Faculty Senate, she delivered on her promise to play a hands-on role and participate across campus as the voice of the faculty.
</p><p>Employee service awards were presented to 73 people who have been with the university for five years; 10-year pins were awarded to 28 people; and 37 others were acknowledged for 15 years of service.
</p><p>Frances Payne Adler was awarded emeritus status, a process that involved nomination and approval by faculty members, followed by administrative approvals.
</p><p>Adler, who joined the university in 1996, founded the Creative Writing and Social Action Program. She is a renowned poet.

</p><p>How could bringing home CSU Monterey Bay’s first NCAA Division II national championship not be the No. 1 Most Memorable Moment in 2010-11? A six-tournament victory streak capped by a national title brought the spotlight of the collegiate golf world to Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Winning a national championship requires a team effort, yet the top moment in 2010-11 Otter Athletics as voted on by the fans recognized a tremendous individual accomplishment, which sparked the team to victory. Sophomore Dylan Jackson hit two huge shots on the back nine that proved instrumental in his individual victory over Lynn University's Roberto Francioni
</p><p>First, Jackson aced the 178-yard 13th hole. He then had the Otter fans watching online hold their collective breath as he sunk a 30-foot putt on 18 to tie the team score at 2. His older brother, John Johnson, then stepped up and clinched the title a few moments later.
</p><p>The championship, CSUMB's first NCAA title, was a fitting end to the finest overall season in Otter athletics history. Otter fans can hope that their most memorable moment from last season will proved to be a jumping-off point to bigger and better things in 2011-12.

</p><p>Aug. 19 was move-in day at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The parking lots bustled with incoming students and their parents unloading bags and boxes of clothing, comforters, pillows, electronics and precious keepsakes from home.
</p><p>Many of the 845 freshmen and 550 new transfer students – some of whom were separating from their families for the first time – spent the day moving into residence halls that will be their homes for the next year, meeting their roommates and figuring out how to arrange the furniture.
</p><p>They moved into buildings that were refurbished over the summer, with new paint and carpeting.
</p><p>Throughout the weekend, 1,800 students moved onto main campus. The student body was expected to number about 5,200 when classes started on Aug. 22.
</p><p>Volunteers – students and staff members – were posted around campus to help carry things, give directions and answer questions, telling people where to check in, how to obtain a campus ID card and where to grab lunch.
</p><p>The university scheduled a week’s worth of activities to help the new students get acquainted with each other and connect to the campus. An ice cream social, comedy and music concert, and a late-night DJ in the Student Center got the week rolling on Friday.
