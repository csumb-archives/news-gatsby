<p>CSU Monterey Bay fared well in the annual <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/">College Guide and Rankings</a> released Aug. 25 by Washington Monthly magazine.
</p><p>The nonprofit magazine measures schools based on how well they enroll and graduate low-income students, support research, and encourage students’ public service. Among the factors it uses are the percentage of students who receive Pell Grants, the federal aid for low-income students; the net price of attendance after financial aid; the numbers of students who join the Peace Corps; and faculty awards for research. CSUMB was rated in the top 15 percent of schools in the <a href="//www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings-2014/masters-universities-rank.php">master’s universities category</a>. According to the magazine, 42 percent of CSUMB students receive Pell grants; the net cost is $8,918; and 39 percent of students graduate after six years.
</p><p>Overall, CSUMB ranked 94th among the 671 schools in the category. Its best rating – 17th – was in the category of service staff, courses and financial aid support.
</p><p>The Washington Monthly ranking is different from other prominent listings such as the one compiled by U.S. News &amp; World Report, which places more emphasis on a school’s financial endowment, academic reputation and selectivity in admission.
</p><p>“Instead of crediting colleges that reject the most applicants, we recognize those that do the best job of enrolling and graduating low-income students. Our rankings measure both research spending and success in preparing undergraduates to earn Ph.D.’s. And by giving equal weight to public service, we identify colleges that build a sense of obligation to their communities and the nation at large,” the magazine said.
</p><p>Its measurements line up with the plan by President Obama to rate colleges, the magazine’s editors said. The administration’s new ratings, which are scheduled to go into effect in time for the next school year, will include measures of affordability, access and outcome.
