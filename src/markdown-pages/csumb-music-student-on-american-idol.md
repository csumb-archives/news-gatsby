<h3>Singer earns ticket to Hollywood</h3><p>A bit of encouragement from Mariah Carey helped Cal State Monterey Bay student Stevie Rae Stephens land a ticket to Hollywood.
</p><p>Stephens, a 21-year-old senior from Livermore, auditioned for the prime-time hit program “American Idol” last summer in Long Beach, one of eight sites across the country where singers tried to earn a coveted “golden ticket” to the next round of competition.
</p><p>“Mariah ended up giving me a thumbs up offstage before my audition and that took some of the nerves away,” Stephens said.
</p><p>Idol’s “Hollywood Week” episodes will air Feb. 6 and 7.
</p><p>Stephens has been singing since she was a child. Her parents inspired her to be a performer, she said. “It’s like it’s genetic.”
</p><p>The Idol audition wasn’t really something she’d planned for. “I auditioned because a friend invited me to do it with them,” she said. “When I learned I got a gold ticket, my first reaction was shock.”
</p><p>Her favorite “American Idol” contestant is Kelly Clarkson, winner of the first competition in 2002. “She is literally my idol,” Stephens said. “She’s such an inspiration, I love her music. I love her story.”
</p><p>Stevens plans to pursue her education – she’ll graduate in May with a degree in music recording technology and hopes to pursue a master’s degree – and a performing career at the same time.
</p><p>According to Dr. Lanier Sammons, an instructor in the recording technology program, Stephens has an advantage over her competitors.
</p><p>He told the Monterey Herald: “She understands the process of recording from the inside. In her studies, she focuses on microphones,” he said. “I don’t think many “American Idol” contestants will know how a mic works the way she knows it,” he said.
</p><p>She’s happy to represent her school and is appreciative of all the support she’s gotten.
</p><p>On the CSUMB Facebook page, 1,083 people have “liked” the story about her success. She responded with a message of appreciation.
</p><p>“OK, seriously. Over 1,000 likes. You guys have no idea how much support I feel right now,” she wrote. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you.” <a href="http://csumb.edu/music">Learn about the music program at CSUMB</a>.
