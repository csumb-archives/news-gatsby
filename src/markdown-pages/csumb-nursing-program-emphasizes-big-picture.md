<p>To explain how a two-year nursing program will differ from a four-year degree, a very visual Tom McKay moves to the whiteboard and draws a two-square graphic. On the first square, the director of the nursing program at Cal State Monterey Bay writes skills typically obtained under an associate's degree: how to draw blood, how to give shots. On the second square, he writes the knowledge a student would get with a bachelor's: public health, information technology, policy. â€“ Oakland Tribune, Jan. 4, 2012
