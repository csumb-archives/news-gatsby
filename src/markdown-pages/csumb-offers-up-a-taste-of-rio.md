</p><p>The intricate, throbbing rhythms, colors and excitement of contemporary Brazil will be on display at CSU Monterey Bay's University Center on Dec. 3 when master percussionist Jorge Alabe and his group Samba Rio present "The Story of Brazilian Samba."
</p><p>The public is invited to the 7 p.m. event. Admission is free.
</p><p>Mr. Alabe's skill developed as he grew up playing Afro-Brazilian and samba rhythms in Rio de Janeiro, and took him around the world as director of percussion with the legendary performing company Oba Oba. A popular performer and teacher, he has conducted workshops at schools and universities in the U.S. since 1993. He's now based in the San Francisco Bay area.
</p><p>At CSUMB, his presentation will trace the roots and development of samba, Brazil's national rhythm, and explain the country's place within the context of the wider African Diaspora. Brazil's relationship to the U.S. and Latino communities here will also be explored.
</p><p>Various styles of Brazilian music and dance will be performed and explained, including candombl√©, samba de roda, pagode and batucada. Each style represents a stage in the development of samba, or a different setting in which the music is played.
</p><p>Dr. Umi Vaughan, professor of Africana Studies at CSUMB, will be the host for the evening and will perform with Mr. Alabe.
</p><p>The 75-minute performance will conclude with a short question-and-answer session.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map. For more information, contact Dr. Vaughan at 582-3116.
