<p>CSUMB launched a new partnership with Zipcar, the world’s leading car sharing network, to offer a Zipcar car sharing program on campus. The convenient transportation option is now available at an affordable rate 24 hours a day, seven days a week for students, faculty, and staff ages 18 and older, as well as members of the local community over the age of 21.
</p><p>CSUMB will initially offer two vehicles, a Ford Focus and a Subaru Impreza. The Zipcars will have designated parking spots located on campus in Lot 16 and Lot 205 for convenient pick&#45;up and return.
</p><p>This year, CSUMB members can join for $15, with rates for Zipcar vehicles on campus starting as low as $7.50 per hour and $69 per day. After the first year, members will pay an annual membership fee of $25. Gas, insurance, and up to 180 miles of driving per day are included in Zipcar rates, and cars can be reserved for as little as an hour or for multiple days. CSUMB students, faculty and staff can join Zipcar at <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/csumb">zipcar.com/CSUMB</a>.
</p><p>“We are excited to have this program on campus. It’s a tremendous benefit for students without vehicles, especially international students.” said CSUMB Student Transportation Coordinator Bernard Green. “Subsidies from Ford are supporting this program for the campus community, who also enjoy the benefit of having access to Zipcars worldwide.”
</p><p>Members with iPhone and Android devices may download the Zipcar mobile app to make reservations, lock and unlock the vehicles and honk the horn to help locate the vehicle. Reservations can also be made over the phone or on Zipcar’s website.
</p><p>“The Zipcar program on campus gives students, faculty and staff the freedom of using a car without the hassle of owning one,” said Katelyn Bushey, Zipcar director of university sales. “We’re happy to partner with California State University, Monterey Bay, to give their community a transportation option to fit their needs and their wallet.”
</p><p>Zipcar has established relationships with more than 500 universities across North America.
