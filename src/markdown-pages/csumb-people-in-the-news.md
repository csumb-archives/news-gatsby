</p><p><strong>Angela Mele,</strong> a student in CSUMB's Science Illustration program, is spending a month this summer as an artist&#45;in&#45;residence at Glacier National Park in Montana. She will create illustrations of flora and fauna for use in educational programs and activities related to the park's fire ecology program.
</p><p>According to the National Park Service, the purpose of the artist&#45;in&#45;residence program is to stimulate and foster the artistic exploration of the park and to share the artist's inspiration with the public through educational programs and exhibits.
</p><p>The Science Illustration program moved to CSUMB from UC Santa Cruz Extension at the start of the 2009&#45;10 school year. One of the most prestigious programs of its kind in the nation, the program prepares students who are sought after by renowned institutions and publications around the world.

</p><h5>Grad's work gives young offenders a voice</h5><p>While doing research for his capstone project, CSUMB graduate <strong>Sam Peterson</strong> learned about "The Beat Within," a weekly publication that features the writing of incarcerated youth. The publication was started by volunteers in San Francisco in 1996; it has expanded to much of California.
</p><p>The project began in Monterey County's Juvenile Hall in June 2008, and Peterson has been leading writing classes at least twice a month since then.  "The stories these young people tell reveal a reality hidden from many," Peterson told the Monterey Herald.  "The lifestyle that some of these kids live is not publicized anywhere."
</p><p>Peterson and other volunteers type up the pieces, write a comment on each one and send them to the project's San Francisco headquarters. A few weeks later, the students see their pieces in a booklet that mirrors a bit of their reality.
</p><p>Peterson,who majored in social and behavioral sciences, would like to expand the program into Monterey County's Youth Center, a low&#45;security residential treatment facility in Salinas.
</p><h5>Drum class on a roll</h5><p>CSUMB graduates <strong>Javier Tamayo</strong> and <strong>Omar Murillo</strong> are using their love of music to benefit children in the east Salinas community where they both live.
</p><p>While still students, the two drummers decided to start a percussion group for kids. Murillo applied for a grant from the Community Foundation for Monterey County in early 2009; in August of that year, they received $3,750 &#45; enough to buy several drum sets. With that, the nonprofit Alisal Percussion was established and lessons began.
</p><p>Murillo and Tamayo lug the drum sets to the Cesar Chavez Library every Wednesday night. More than 50 people attended a recent class and the numbers grow each week.
</p><p>"Young teenage boys are the group we can't really get into the library, and they were out here, as well as younger kids," librarian Carissa Purnell told the Salinas Californian.
</p><p>The program has gone so well, it is expanding to a low&#45;income housing development, where classes will be offered two nights a week.
</p><p>Tamayo is currently employed as a recruiter for the College Assistance Migrant Program at CSUMB. Murillo is a retention adviser at the university.
