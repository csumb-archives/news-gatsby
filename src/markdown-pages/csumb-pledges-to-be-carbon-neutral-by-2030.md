</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay's Climate Action Plan aims to cut the university's net carbon emission to zero by 2030. Phase 1 of the plan was released on Sept. 15.
</p><p>It fulfills the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment that CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison signed in 2007, and pledges the university to a path of climate neutrality.
</p><p>The plan includes specific actions across nine focus areas - energy; solid waste; green building; transportation; food service; purchasing; water; CSUMB and California State University planning policies and directives; and education and outreach.
</p><p>"Global warming is a defining challenge of our time," Dr. Harrison said.
</p><p>"Human activities are responsible for the problem, and working together humans have the capacity to solve the problem," she said. "That means taking serious action to stop adding global warming pollution to the atmosphere.
</p><p>"CSUMB is committed to leading the way."
</p><p>The plan, developed by faculty, staff and students, will act as a road map for future university decisions. The campus has set goals to save as much energy as possible, generate energy from renewable sources and explore carbon offsets as a last resort.
</p><p>Phase II of the plan will include goals, implementation strategies, financial feasibility and how to track progress. It will be competed by March 2010.
</p><p>Phase I of the plan noted:
</p><p>• A decline in energy use from 2005 to 2009 due to efficiency upgrades, even though the university's overall square footage increased. Projects have focused on heating, ventilation and lighting. Some of these projects have been recognized as best practices within the CSU system and have received awards from outside organizations. Energy management is an ongoing program at CSUMB, with dedicated resources.
</p><p>• About 3,000 tons of waste was recycled in 2008 and nearly 3,700 tons sent to the landfill.
</p><p>• The Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library is undergoing review by the U.S. Green Building Council for a LEED Silver rating; the university is also seeking a LEED Silver rating for the renovated Dining Commons.
</p><p>•  CSUMB is in the early stages of devising a plan to reduce single-occupant vehicle trips.
</p><p>• Cleaning products used on campus are Green Seal Certified.
</p><p>• East Campus housing units and new buildings are being metered in an effort to reduce water usage.
</p><p>• New campus development is taking place within a centralized core connected by bike and pedestrian pathways within a 10-minute walk. Approximately 25 percent of the campus has been designated as native oak open space, and new development is taking place in already-developed areas.
</p><p>• More than 15 academic courses teach some aspect of sustainability. Student capstone research has covered topics such as biodiesel, wind and solar energy; water collection, storage and reuse; composting; fog collection; and recycling.
</p><p>According to the plan, the university intents to continue monitoring energy use, improve campus recycling, build to LEED Silver certifiable standards and create more transportation options.
</p><p>The American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), which began in 2007, is a network of <a href="http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/signatories/list">650 signatory schools</a> dedicated to making an environmental impact. The schools commit to becoming climate neutral and integrating environmental education into their curricula, and sign a pledge to submit a Climate Action Plan within two years.
</p><p>On Sept. 15, 2009, the first deadline for the organization's 392 original members, 88 colleges and universities announced their Climate Action Plans, representing the largest group to simultaneously commit to concrete activities that address global warming.
</p><p>The plans list specific steps schools are taking to reach climate neutrality by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and operations costs.
</p><p>Schools are already noticing that in saving energy, they also are saving significant money, organizers say.
</p><p>Most schools also are incorporating curriculum changes to prepare students to meet the massive challenge of climate issues upon graduation.
</p><p>The Climate Action Plans submitted also show that universities are making a significant shift toward using renewable energy sources.
</p><p>The vast majority of schools submitting Climate Action Plans have already submitted their greenhouse gas inventories, the first step to determining and reducing their carbon footprint. CSUMB submitted its greenhouse gas inventory on Sept. 15, 2008. It can be found at <a href="http://acupcc.aashe.org/ghg-report.php?id=370">http://acupcc.aashe.org/ghg-report.php?id=370</a>.
