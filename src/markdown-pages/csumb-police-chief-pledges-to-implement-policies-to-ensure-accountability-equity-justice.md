  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., June 12, 2020</b> - California State University police
  chiefs on all 23 campuses, including CSUMB Police Chief Earl Lawson, have
  banned the use of the carotid control hold — commonly called a chokehold — and
  pledged to implement policing recommendations made by a federal task force in
  2015.
</p>
<p>
  "As police chiefs of the California State University's 23 campus police
  departments, we have been galvanized by the many voices across our state and
  nation demanding accountability, equity and justice," the chiefs said in a
  joint statement.
</p>
<p>
  "We have seen the tragic impact of racism and bigotry, and many in our
  departments have experienced it personally. We are unitedly determined to take
  action."
</p>
<p>
  CSU Chancellor Timothy White and every CSU campus president supports the
  pledge to adopt recommendations of
  <a href="https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf"
    >The President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing</a
  >, reported to then-President Barack Obama in May 2015, according to the
  chiefs.
</p>
<p>
  "We are determined to lead by example, joining a growing number of American
  cities that have committed — collectively and collaboratively — to address
  police use-of-force policies," the statement continued.
</p>
<p>
  "To that end, and effective immediately, we are prohibiting the use of the
  carotid control hold by all CSU police officers. Additionally, no CSU police
  officer will receive or participate in trainings that teach the carotid
  control hold."
</p>
<p>
  The task force's recommendations are organized around six pillars: Building
  Trust and Legitimacy, Policy and Oversight, Technology and Social Media,
  Officer Wellness and Safety, Community Policing and Crime Reduction, and
  Training and Education.
</p>
<p>
  The chiefs also committed to looking for ways to incorporate those concepts
  into the training and certification provided by the California Commission on
  Peace Officer Standards and Training. All CSU police officers are sworn and
  certified by the commission, and receive further training in de-escalating
  situations that might be caused by mental health or controlled substance
  issues.
