  <b>SEASIDE, CA., May 11, 2020</b> - Cal State Monterey Bay distributed Federal
  CARES Act and Institutional Emergency Relief aid this week - sending cash
  payments to over six-thousand students.
</p>
<p>
  The emergency relief funds, a one-time disbursement, provide all eligible
  students with direct financial assistance of $200 to $1,430. The largest
  payments went to those students with the greatest need, according to the
  Department of Education guidelines and Title IV eligibility standards. Nearly
  1,700 students received the maximum amount of funding, and over 360 students
  have already received additional emergency grants through a separate
  application and determination process. Payments from federal CARES Act funds
  distributed thus far include 5,924 students who received a total of $3,578,100
  in aid.

  “The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our nation at all levels. While much of
  the response has focused on health and safety, the country’s financial welfare
  is an integral element of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security
  Act passed by Congress,” said Dr. Ronnie Higgs, Vice President of Student
  Affairs and Enrollment Services. “In keeping with our commitment to serving
  all students, we identified other non-federal sources to assist those who did
  not qualify under the CARES Act, including Dream Act and undocumented
  students. It is important for the university to assist as many students in
  need as we can.”
</p>
<p>
  As a part of the CARES Act, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund made
  available financial resources for the direct relief of students and to offset
  university operating losses and additional expenses related to the COVID-19
  response. In total, Cal State Monterey Bay anticipates receiving $8.45
  million, to be split evenly between direct relief to the students and
  supporting university operating costs.
