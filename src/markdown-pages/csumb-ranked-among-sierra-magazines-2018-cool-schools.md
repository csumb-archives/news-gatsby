  SEASIDE, Calif., August 27, 2018<i> – </i>California State University Monterey
  Bay (CSUMB) was recognized today by<i> Sierra</i> magazine, the national
  magazine of the Sierra Club, who released its twelfth annual “Cool Schools”
  ranking of North America’s greenest colleges and universities.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB ranked
  <a
    href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/cool-schools-2018/cool-schools-2018-full-ranking"
    >145 out of 269 schools</a
  >
  and joined 15 other CSU campuses, including Chico, Humboldt, Sacramento,
  Northridge, San Jose, Channel Islands, Cal Poly and San Diego, in recognition
  for their commitment to sustainability.
</p>
<p>
  Sierra received complete surveys from a record-breaking 269 schools, which now
  include Canadian schools and community colleges.
</p>
<p>
  Sierra's ranking serves as "a guide for prospective students, current
  students, administrators, and alumni to compare colleges’ commitments to
  environmentalism. It also serves to spur healthy competition among schools,
  raise environmental standards on campus, and publicly reward the institutions
  that work hard to protect the planet."
</p>
<p>
  This is the second year CSUMB has participated in the survey; in 2017 we
  ranked 152 out of 227 schools.
</p>
<p>
  “I am very pleased we have improved our ranking,” said Lacey Raak, CSUMB's
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/sustainability">Sustainability Director</a>. “It
  reflects tens of thousands of hours of hard work by staff, faculty and
  students throughout the campus to raise awareness, to have conversations and,
  most important, to act. It starts by changing behavior and making decisions
  that support the sustainability of our campus and community. By working
  together, I am confident that we will continue to improve in the years to
  come.”

  completed questionnaire, is online at
