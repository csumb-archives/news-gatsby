  <b>SEASIDE, Ca., September 19, 2019 –</b> California State University,
  Monterey Bay (CSUMB) has received a grant from the
  <a href="https://hospicegiving.org/">Hospice Giving Foundation</a> in the
  amount of $60,000 to fund a regional palliative care study. The feasibility
  study, led by CSUMB
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/nursing">Department of Nursing</a> chair and
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/directory/person/aerikson"
    >associate professor Alyssa Erikson</a
  >, will plan how best to offer palliative care education in Monterey County.
</p>
<p>
  Increasing educational opportunities in the region will strengthen the
  capability of healthcare providers by delivering high quality, linguistically
  and culturally appropriate care to people with serious illness and their
  families.
</p>
<p>
  Palliative care is delivered by an interdisciplinary team and strives to
  improve quality of life for those with life-threatening illness, like cancer,
  heart failure or emphysema. There are many people living with serious illness
  who can benefit from palliative care but, like most places, Monterey County is
  limited by the number of trained and knowledgeable providers.
</p>
<p>
  “I’m very grateful that our team received these funds for us to complete a
  full investigation into what educational model would best serve our
  community,” said Erikson. “We are very excited to get started on the work and
  deeply committed to improving the capacity for our community to provide
  palliative care services.”
</p>
<p>
  The team of researchers is comprised of Central Coast healthcare professionals
  with a shared desire to expand palliative care services in the region to
  include: CSUMB

  <a href="https://csumb.edu/directory/person/cbeye">Colleen Beye</a> along with
  Alisha Mann and Dr. Wendell Harry, a palliative care physician at Salinas
  Valley Memorial Hospital and Natividad Medical Center.
</p>
<p>
  Each team member brings a variety of expertise and experience to the project,
  which includes nursing, medicine, public health and public administration.
</p>
<p>
  “As a rural, mostly Latino community, we want to determine the best way to
  maximize palliative care services.” said Alisha Mann. “With a rigorous
  feasibility process, our goal is to put forward a plan that meets the
  community needs.”
