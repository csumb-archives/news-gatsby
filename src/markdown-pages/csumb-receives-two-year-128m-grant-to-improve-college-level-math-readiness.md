<p><strong>SEASIDE, Ca., Nov. 18, 2016 &#45;&#45;</strong> California State University Monterey Bay &#40;CSUMB&#41; is one of four CSU campuses to be awarded a two&#45;year, $1.28 million grant from the <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ps/itqsahe.asp">California Mathematics Readiness Challenge Initiative &#40;CMRCI&#41;.</a> Administered by the California Department of Education, the grant has enabled CSUMB to partner with local K&#45;12 school districts, community colleges and non&#45;profit agencies to provide professional development for high school teachers improving college&#45;level math readiness among high school seniors.
</p><p>According to Joanne Lieberman, CSUMB Associate Professor of Mathematics and Statistics, one of the major impacts of this program will be the development of a new fourth&#45;year high school mathematics course for students deemed not yet ready for college&#45;level math.
</p><p>The newly formed Monterey County Consortium for Mathematics Readiness &#40;MCCMR&#41; has allowed CSUMB to partner with Hartnell College, the Monterey County Office of Education, the Monterey Bay Area Mathematics Project at UC Santa Cruz and six school districts across Monterey County. This comprehensive project will address the severe under&#45;preparation for college mathematics that is pervasive in the county and help support the success of the CSU's <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/graduation&#45;initiative&#45;2025">Graduation Initiative 2025</a>.
</p><p>For further information about MCCMR or how this program will be implemented please contact Joanne Lieberman at jlieberman@csumb.edu.
