</p><p>MJ, one of the country's oldest investigative magazines, has included CSU Monterey Bay in its first Mini College Guide - a list of 10 diverse schools that "will blow your mind, not your budget," according to its Aug. 20 edition.
</p><p>While the magazine admits that its listing is unscientific, it includes schools that have "good values and good value." Among them are public and private colleges and universities, religious and secular schools and urban and rural campuses.
</p><p>It points out that $39,000 is the going rate for tuition at the liberal arts schools that top the list in U.S. News &amp; World Report's annual college rankings. The 10 schools on MJ's list "have plenty to offer," and for a lot less money. Fees at CSUMB are approximately $4,500 for the 2009-10 academic year. 
</p><p>The magazine also notes that the Monterey Bay serves as a classroom for CSUMB's popular Environmental Science, Technology and Policy major.
