<p>The 2012 edition of The Princeton Review's Guide to 322 Green Colleges has named CSU Monterey Bay as one of the most eco-friendly in the U.S. and Canada – and the guide didn't even mention the LEED-certified library, the highlight of the campus. The guide rates the "greenness" of colleges based on their academic offerings, campus infrastructure, activities and career prep. – <em>Monterey County Weekly,</em> May 24, 2012
