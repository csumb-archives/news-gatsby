<p>Robert Chapman, the spouse of Patricia Tynan Chapman, passed away at home recently. He was 91 years old.
</p><p>Patricia and Robert Chapman were the lead donors for the Chapman Science Academic Center, a 68,000&#45;square&#45;foot facility the CSUMB College of Science now calls home. The Chapmans, Salinas residents and community leaders donated $2.5 million toward construction costs for the state of the art facility.
</p><p>Opening in fall 2003, the Chapman Science Academic Center was CSUMB’s first new building since the university’s founding. The structure integrates sustainable materials and is cited as a successful and important first step toward realizing the master plan for the future design of the campus.
