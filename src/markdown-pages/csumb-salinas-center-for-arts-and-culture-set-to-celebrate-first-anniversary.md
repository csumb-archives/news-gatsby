  (CSUMB) Salinas Center For Arts and Culture will celebrate it’s first
  anniversary with a series of Dias de Muertos related events on Friday,
  November 2, 2018.

  Over the past year, the Center for Arts and Culture has hosted a wide range of
  events, which are free and open to the public, to include monthly first Friday
  events. This month's first Friday, on November 2, will include an array of
  workshops and exhibitions along with a Dias de Muertos procession.

  Originally an indigenous tradition, Dias de Muertos has evolved through time
  with diverse cultural influences. It is a celebration of life that
  commemorates passed ancestors and all life forms. Dias de Muertos can include
  people, animals and nature. In Salinas, Dias de Muertos has brought together
  people from all cultures through art, music, dance, costumes, make-up, food
  and celebration for generations.
