<p>Bacone College in Muskogee, Okla., will host a symposium on March 23 with a decidedly CSUMB feel.
</p><p>The symposium, "Beyond 1492: Inter Caetera, a Papal Bull, the Requiremento and the Legacy of the Doctrine of Discovery,” is sponsored by the college’s Center for American Indians. CSUMB archaeology professor Ruben Mendoza is the keynote speaker.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza has explored the American Southwest, Europe, Mexico and Central America documenting pre&#45;Columbian and Colonial era sites. He recently traveled to Rome to participate in events to examine the canonization of Father Junipero Serra. He is an expert on American Indian science, technology, medicine and modern material cultures.

Following his address, Dr.Kathryn England&#45;Aytes, a lecturer in CSUMB’s Psychology Department, will be part of a panel discussion featuring Native scholars and students.

She works with the Native American Children’s Alliance &#40;NACA&#41;, an inter&#45;tribal nonprofit that works on child abuse prevention and intervention. As a board member and trainer, she has given presentations on child forensic interviewing and cultural awareness in multidisciplinary team settings.
</p><p>Her chapter on historical trauma and its prevention in the classroom appeared in the well&#45;received book “Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education” by Four Arrows.
