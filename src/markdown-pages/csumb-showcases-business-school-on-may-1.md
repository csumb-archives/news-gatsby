<p>Teaching students isn’t the only goal of the School of Business at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The school also wants the community to learn about the business program.
</p><p>On May 1, it will hold the fifth annual School of Business Showcase designed to highlight the school and its students. The event, featuring a reception and dinner, is an opportunity for employers to meet graduating seniors, learn about the business program and meet faculty members and alumni. It will also honor two members of the local community.
</p><p>The Business Leadership Award will be presented to Andy Matsui of Matsui Nursery, Inc. The Community Leadership Award will go to Ollie Nutt of the Monterey Peninsula Foundation.
</p><p>The leadership awards were inaugurated in 2009 to recognize community leaders who have shown a commitment to CSU Monterey Bay and the mission of the university. Student awards, including one for the school’s outstanding senior, will also be presented at the showcase. “For us, the stars of the event are the graduating seniors,” said Dr. Marylou Shockley, chair of the School of Business. “We want to celebrate them, and we want the business community to do that with us – especially those who are employers in the area.”
