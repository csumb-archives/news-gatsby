<p>The approach of winter can mean only one thing – it’s time for another one of Warren Miller’s cinematic homages to high-adrenaline ski and snowboard action. Is there a better way to get stoked for the upcoming ski season?
</p><p>Miller’s new film, Flow State, will be shown at Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 15, part of a 240-city tour of North America.
</p><p>Flow State guides viewers to the top of the world’s most striking peaks, taking them on an exhilarating journey across the globe to Norway, Austria, California, Switzerland and beyond. The powder in Japan will send you scrambling to tune-up your gear, the gravity in Telluride will have you scheduling an avalanche refresher course, and the steeps in Alaska will drive you to push a little harder during your next preseason workout. Winter is right around the corner, and it is time to enter the Flow State . . . where the mountain meets the mind. The film will be shown at 7 p.m. in the Black Box Cabaret on Fourth Street near Inter-Garrison Boulevard. The show is free to CSUMB students, $5 for faculty and staff, and $10 for members of the public. Tickets are available at the door.
</p><p>Sponsors include CSUMB Outdoor Recreation, Outdoor Adventure Club and the Otter Student Union.
