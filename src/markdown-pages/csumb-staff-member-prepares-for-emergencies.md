</p><p><strong>Ehlers attends Homeland Security training course</strong>
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay staff member Diane Ehlers recently completed a course for emergency responders at the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Ala. The center is operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency &#40;FEMA&#41;.
</p><p>Ehlers, the university's director of environmental protection, health and safety, received training in environmental health issues including food safety, sanitation, hazardous materials, vector control and shelter health and safety issues.
</p><p>"As the person responsible for environmental and public health at CSUMB, I found the training to be relevant and useful," Ehlers said. "The instructors were all experts with hands&#45;on experience in disaster preparedness and response."
</p><p>The center provides federally funded interdisciplinary training for emergency responders across the United States. It offers training in 10 areas, including public health â€“ the course Ehlers completed.
</p><p>Participants are selected from among the nation's 11 million emergency responders. The training is intended to give them the critical skills and confidence they need to be prepared to deal with local emergencies.
</p><p>Ehlers volunteered for the all&#45;expenses&#45;paid course. She has worked at CSUMB for 15 years.
