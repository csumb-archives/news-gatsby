<p>Chelsea Amarillas, a senior Cinematic Arts and Technology student, was awarded a $2,000 scholarship in the Monterey County Film Commission’s Director Emeritus Richard Tyler Student Scholarship and Awards program.</p><p>Amarillas will use the award to help cover costs for her capstone film, “A Father’s Love.” She describes the story as a dark and enchanting tale that illustrates the importance of family. Filming will get under way in the fall, and she has begun looking for locations in Monterey County, including a Victorian&#45;style house.
</p><p>“The stylization of the film is modern but with Victorian elements, and this award will allow me to achieve the level of quality production design that I had hoped to,” Amarillas said. “Receiving this scholarship is an honor because I was selected from a group of talented peers, and it is encouraging as a young filmmaker to be recognized and rewarded for the craft that I am just beginning,” she said. “The award will be of great assistance financially in the production of a film that is near to my heart and one that I am very excited to see come to life.”
</p><p>Amarillas, a Modesto native, has worked on several productions with her fellow CSUMB film students.
</p><p>The scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to film students and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or those enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County.
