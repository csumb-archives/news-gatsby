  <b>SEASIDE, Ca., April 17, 2020</b> - Two CSU Monterey Bay student researchers
  have been named 2020 Goldwater scholars. Nicholas Heyer and Samantha Miller,
  both undergraduates in the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/science">College of Science</a>, were the only two
  recipients in the California State University (CSU) system this year.
</p>
<p>
  "This is an incredible honor for our students and for our campus. Having two
  students from CSUMB receive prestigious Goldwater Awards is remarkable not
  only for the high level of academic achievement it represents, but also
  because they were the only students in the CSU system that received awards
  this year,” said John "Buck" Banks, Undergraduate Research Opportunities
  Center (UROC) director and Goldwater campus representative.

    >The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship</a
  >, established by Congress in 1986 to honor Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, provides
  financial assistance to college sophomores and juniors pursuing careers in
  science, mathematics and engineering. The scholarship is worth up to $7,500
  per year for two years and is based on academic merit. This year, 396
  recipients were selected from a pool of 1,343 nominees. Since 2015, a total of
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/barry-goldwater-scholarship-0"
    >10 CSUMB students have been honored by the Goldwater Foundation</a
  >.
</p>
<p><b>Nicholas Heyer</b></p>
<p>
  A Big Data to Knowledge (<a href="https://csumb.edu/bd2k/bd2k-scholars"
    >BD2K) Scholar,</a
  >
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/uroc-scholars-program">UROC Scholar</a>, and
  molecular biology and mathematics major, Heyer plans to research
  neurodegenerative diseases in order to better understand their causes in an
  effort to effectively combat them.
</p>
<p>
  “This scholarship allows me to join a national scholastic community of
  researchers that have the same level of drive to understand the world as I
  do,” Heyer said.
</p>
<p>
  Heyer conducts research at the
  <a href="https://hausslergenomics.ucsc.edu/"
    >UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute Haussler-Salama Lab</a
  >, as part of the BD2K Enhancing Diversity in Biomedical Data Science grant<i
  > </i>funded by the
  <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a>. The grant
  allows CSUMB students like Heyer to participate in a summer research
  experience at the UCSC Center for
  <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Big Data in Translational Genomics</a>,
  working side-by-side with UCSC scientists and data specialists learning
  research skills to manage and interpret genomic data.
</p>
<p>
  <i> </i><i> </i>The research will help detect birth disorders, “allowing for
  early intervention and, in the long run, a more independent life,” Heyer said.
</p>
<p>
  The Goldwater Scholarship recognizes that Heyer is “an exceptional student and
  researcher,” said Judith Canner, CSUMB BD2K Director and an associate
  professor of statistics.
</p>
<p>
  “But he is also an exceptional person who wants to use his research for the
  betterment of humanity. He already serves our community as a tutor, volunteer
  and research mentor, and I know he will use his career to serve others in big
  ways,” Canner said.
</p>
<p><b>Samantha Miller</b></p>
<p>
  A <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/uroc-scholars-program">UROC Scholar</a> and
  biology major, Miller is working to identify genes “to facilitate the
  production of biological technology that removes pesticides from the
  environment.”
</p>
<p>
  “This scholarship gives me the opportunity to focus on my research and school
  work as an undergraduate, provides me with a valuable national network of
  Goldwater scholars, and encourages me to pursue a research career,” Miller
  said.
</p>
<p>
  "Samantha sets the tone in the lab and is already making significant
  contributions for our research on microbial pesticide remediation, as well as
  collaborating with researchers at other institutions. I am really looking
  forward to seeing what kind of discoveries she makes in the future," said
  Nathaniel Jue, CSUMB faculty mentor and assistant professor in the School of
  Natural Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  Miller plans to pursue a doctorate in archaeogenetics to research human
  evolution through the analysis of ancient DNA, while applying her research to
  the advancement of modern medicine and the development of antimicrobials.
</p>
<p>
  Miller and Heyer’s other mentors include Henrik Kibak with CSUMB, Colleen
  Bosworth and Sofie Salama with UCSC, and Mark Siddall with the American Museum
  of Natural History.
