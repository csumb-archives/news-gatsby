<h3>Monterey County Film Commission honors another TAT student</h3><p>Joey Blackburn is this year’s recipient of the Monterey County Film Commission’s student scholarship.
</p><p>Blackburn, who will graduate later this month from California State University, Monterey Bay with a degree in Teledramatic Arts and Technology, is from Paso Robles. He plans to use the $2,000 grant to help with expenses for his capstone project, a black-and-white horror film entitled, “A Fly in the Room.” Blackburn shot the film on 16mm film, a more expensive option than video.
</p><p>“I wanted to shoot on film for the aesthetic feel that I wanted for my movie, and filming on 16mm was an experience I wanted to have at least one time, knowing that most work opportunities will be in video,” Blackburn told the film commission.
</p><p>“It feels very good to know that all of my efforts studying filmmaking at CSUMB have been rewarded with this scholarship, and tells me that if I continue to work hard, good things will happen.”
</p><p>Blackburn’s film will be screened with other capstones at 1 and 6 p.m. on May 18 at the World Theater on the CSUMB campus. Both programs are free and open to the public.
</p><p>The Monterey County Film Commission scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County.
</p><p>It’s not the first award for Blackburn. Last year, his short film, “Pieces of War,” won first place and $1,000 in a contest sponsored by the George Eastman House Film Festival.
</p><p>The scholarship was created in 2008 and has gone to CSUMB students each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo shared the inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez – who now works in the TAT Department as a media specialist – was the winner. Rachel Asendorf received the award in 2010; Dominic Parisi was last year’s winner.
