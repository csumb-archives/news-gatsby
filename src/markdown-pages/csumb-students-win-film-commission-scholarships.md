<p>Brianna Beavers and Rose Mercurio, seniors in the Cinematic Arts and Technology Department at Cal State Monterey Bay, were awarded $1,500 scholarships in the Monterey County Film Commission’s Director Emeritus Richard Tyler Student Scholarship and Award program.</p><p>Mercurio, who grew up in Salinas, will use her scholarship to help equip her workspace, making it possible for her to create animations of higher quality. Her capstone film is “Grandma’s Card Night,” an animated narrative fiction about the loving relationship between two children and their grandmother.

Beavers, who comes from Modesto, will use the award to help gain exposure in film festivals for her capstone project, “The Call.” She will also use the award for equipment needed for her new film, “When It Rains,” which she plans to shoot in Monterey County.

The scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to film students and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or those enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County.
