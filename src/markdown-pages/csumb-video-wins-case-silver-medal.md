<p>A video telling the story of CSUMB has taken a top honor in the CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education) Circle of Excellence competition. The awards program is open to member colleges, universities, independent schools and nonprofits around the world.
</p><p>The CASE awards “acknowledge superior accomplishments that have lasting impact and demonstrate the highest level of professionalism. Winning programs epitomize the profession’s best practices and raise standards,” according to the organization's website. “Doing What Matters,” a documentary produced by Mac and Ava Motion Pictures of Monterey, was awarded a silver medal in the “long video” category. Duke University won the gold medal while Oregon State finished third among 34 entries in the category. The video is an offshoot of the "Doing What Matters" advertising campaign launched by University Communications in 2013. Both highlight work the university, its students and faculty have done that matters to the region and beyond. “Doing What Matters” picks up where the 10-year anniversary video, “Bayonets to Baccalaureates” – also produced by Mac and Ava – left off. That piece told the story of CSUMB’s founding after the decommissioning of Fort Ord. The new video looks forward to the future and discusses President Ochoa's view of where the university is headed in the next decade.
