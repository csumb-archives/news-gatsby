<p>Looking for a way to reduce the stress of tax season? CSU Monterey Bay students and faculty working with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance – VITA – program may have an answer.</p><p>Until the end of tax season, approximately 40 student and three faculty volunteers from the <a href="https://csumb.edu/business">College of Business</a> will provide free assistance with state and federal income tax preparation.
</p><p>The VITA program is sponsored by United Way Monterey County.
</p><p>CSUMB volunteers are working at all nine county locations, including the Marina library. Volunteers must complete a 30&#45;hour training class and pass a rigorous Internal Revenue Service examination to participate.
</p><p>Families and individuals who earned less than $54,000 in 2015 are eligible. Filers must bring photo identification, Social Security card or ITIN card for workers, their W&#45;2 and 1099 forms and a blank check for direct deposit. Appointments are not necessary.
</p><p>Tax forms will be filed electronically. If a refund is due, it will be deposited in the taxpayer's account.
</p><p>“It’s a good service learning opportunity for students. The first year – 2010 – five students participated. In 2014, the number of student volunteers was 24, and now it’s about 40, all contributing their expertise to help local families,” said Dr. Cathy Ku, professor of accounting at CSUMB and a volunteer tax preparer.
</p><p>There is no charge for the tax preparation, no charge for direct deposit to the taxpayer’s bank account and no hidden fees. A list of <a href="http://www.unitedwaymcca.org/free&#45;tax&#45;prep">community locations, dates and hours</a>, is available on the United Way website.
