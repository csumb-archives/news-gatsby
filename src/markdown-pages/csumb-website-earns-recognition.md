<h2>We’re No. 1</h2><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s website has earned even more recognition in the world of higher education web design.
</p><p>In mid-January, it topped the list of best redesigned sites for 2011 compiled by Karine Joly on her blog, CollegeWebEditor.com. The list was based on Nick DeNardis’ reviews on his video blog, EduCheckup.
</p><p>Other top sites, according to EDU Checkup: University of San Diego, Georgetown University, University of Melbourne, Vassar
</p><p>Every week since 2008, DeNardis has selected a college or university site for comprehensive review. He looks at them from the point of view of a first-time visitor, while critiquing the design, information architecture and code of the sites. He issues each a grade.
</p><p>In November, DeNardis looked at CSUMB.EDU and was impressed enough to give it an A+. He praised the site for its design, as well as its architecture and general functionality, awarding it a total of 292 points of a possible 300.
</p><p>“It’s a great feeling to review a site that just works,” DeNardis said on his blog.
</p><p>Check out his <a href="http://educheckup.com/2011/11/04/california-state-university-monterey-bay-episode-280/">video review</a> DeNardis is the associate director of web communications at Wayne State University and a staff writer at .eduGuru, a higher education marketing and web development blog
</p><p>The redesigned website debuted on Oct. 25, 2010, after more than a year of work by members of the Strategic Communications and Information Technology departments and an outside contractor, White Whale Web Services of Oakland.
</p><p>The redesigned site features work contributed by members of the campus community, including student-produced photos and videos. The site has also been geared for ease of use, with a blend of need-to-know information and room to click around and discover unexpected stories about the university, and its students and faculty.
