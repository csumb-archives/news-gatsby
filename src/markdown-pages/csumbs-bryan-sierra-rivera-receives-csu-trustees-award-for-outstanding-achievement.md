  SEASIDE, Calif., September 11, 2018 – CSUMB senior Bryan Sierra-Rivera has
  been awarded the 2018 California State University (CSU) Trustees’ Award for
  Outstanding Achievement, the CSU’s highest recognition of student achievement.
  The 23 awardees, one from each campus in the CSU, were publicly recognized
  during the CSU Board of Trustees meeting in Long Beach on September 11, 2018.

  This award is the CSU's highest recognition of student achievement and
  provides donor-funded scholarships to students who demonstrate superior
  academic performance, personal accomplishments, community service and
  financial need. Students receiving the awards have all demonstrated
  inspirational resolve along the path to college success and many are the first
  in their families to attend college.

  “These student scholars embody the leadership, diversity and academic
  excellence the California State University is known for,” said CSU Chancellor
  Timothy P. White. “They have traced unique paths to their goal of a higher
  education and serve as powerful examples to their families, communities and
  California. The awards will give these high‐achieving and deserving students
  even more opportunities to attain their academic and career goals.”

  “Being recognized by President Ochoa and the CSU Board of Trustee's to receive
  this scholarship is a one of a kind privilege that I am so grateful for,” said
  Sierra-Rivera. “This scholarship will help me to fund my endeavors as I apply
  for graduate schools. I am honored to be able to represent CSU Monterey Bay,
  CSU system, and first-generation college undergraduates aiming for a higher
  education.”

  Sierra-Rivera plans to be the first member of his family to earn a Ph.D. and
  then plans to apply his knowledge and experience within academia to help other
  first-generation college students from underrepresented minorities pursue
  opportunities in education.

  More than 340 students have been honored with the Trustees’ Award since the
  scholarship program was established in 1984 by the William Randolph Hearst
  Foundation. In 1999, the William Randolph Hearst Foundation partnered with the
  CSU Board of Trustees to supplement the endowment with contributions from CSU
  Trustees, CSU Foundation Board of Governors, and private donors.
