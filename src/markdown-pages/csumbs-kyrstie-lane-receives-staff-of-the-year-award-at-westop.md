  Opportunity Personnel (WESTOP) has honored Kyrstie Lane, Associate Director of
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/trio">TRiO Student Support Services</a> at CSUMB
  with the Staff of the Year Award for her commitment and service to her team
  and students.
</p>
<p>
  The Staff of the Year Award is the highest honor awarded by the Western
  Association of Educational Opportunity Personnel and recognizes individuals
  whose commitment, perseverance, and contributions go “above and beyond” what
  is expected for the success of his / her students and respective program.
</p>
<p>
  "[She] supports our students in landing opportunities beyond their wildest
  dreams, such as graduate school application approvals, scholarship awards,
  internship opportunities, helping students when their college experience takes
  a turn, and, most importantly, serving as one of their biggest support systems
  in an environment that was not meant for their success.”
