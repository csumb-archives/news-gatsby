<p>&#40;July 7, 2016&#41; – Cal State Monterey Bay’s Upward Bound program continues to grow. The program is hosting nearly 100 under&#45;privileged youth from North Monterey County, Soledad and Watsonville high schools, the largest summer group ever for the Monterey Bay region. The federally&#45;funded program began serving local students in 1999.
</p><p>A year&#45;round program, Upward Bound guides low&#45;income and first&#45;generation students through the college application process and is divided into two parts.
</p><p>During the academic year, the students receive tutoring, academic advising, college and career exploration and financial aid mentoring from Upward Bound staff members during school visits. During the six&#45;week summer session, the students live in CSUMB residence halls and participate in academic, social, recreational and cultural activities. The six&#45;week session qualifies as a four unit academic class, giving students a head start on college credits after they finish high school.
</p><p>Elective classes during the summer session include disc golf, guitar and dance. The ropes challenge course, with students utilizing teamwork to navigate obstacles nearly 100 feet above ground, is a major highlight.
</p><p>The program has been an inspiration and life&#45;changing experience for countless students. One student, Joel Ruiz, now attends UC Santa Barbara after completing the Upward Bound program in high school. He has come back to Upward Bound as a peer mentor.
</p><p>“Upward Bound is why I went to college – it instilled a dream and showed that yes, college could be a reality,” Ruiz said. “I’m the youngest of four children and the first to attend college. When I was younger, I didn’t know how to fill out financial aid applications. I didn’t know what to put on my college applications. This program changed that.”
</p><p>The numbers speak for themselves. In the last four years, 100&#45;percent of Upward Bound participants graduated from high school. From there, 98&#45;percent of Upward Bound participants enrolled into a college or university immediately after graduation.
</p><p>The national Upward Bound program was established shortly after the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 under then President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</p><p>The program continues through July 21. To read more about Upward Bound at CSUMB, go to <a href="http://csumb.edu/eosp/upward&#45;bound">csumb.edu/eosp/upward&#45;bound</a>.
