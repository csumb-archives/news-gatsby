<h3>Annual event celebrates legacy of late labor leader </h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay will be closed on March 30 in honor of Cesar Chavez.  Chavez led the non-violent movement for farm workers’ rights, a movement that extended beyond the fields and into cities and towns across the nation, and helped found the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farm Workers (UFW). Even with campus closed, the university community is still in action. On that day, and during the following weeks, many faculty, staff and students dedicate their time to both service and learning. ??March 30 will mark the start of CSUMB’s second annual Cesar Chavez Challenge, a 36-day community service drive – it ends on Cinco de Mayo – coordinated by the Purposeful Service Opportunities program. PSO is a joint project of the AmeriCorps VIP program and the Service Learning Institute. The theme for this year’s challenge is “Creating a Culture of Service,” and involves a friendly competition among student clubs, Greek organizations, athletic teams and residence halls to document 3,600 hours of service.
</p><p>This year, extra points will be awarded for uploading photos to a Facebook page that show volunteers at work, and registering for an online volunteer account with the Volunteer Center of Monterey County. Also new this year: Points will be awarded for philanthropic efforts, such as fundraisers and food drives, and for civic engagement, such as voter registration and attendance at city council meetings.
