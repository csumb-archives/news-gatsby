<p>The acclaimed Paul Taylor Dance Company will pay a return visit to California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater on April 22.</p><p>The visit marks the fourth appearance of the New York&#45;based company at the World Theater.
</p><p>As both pupil and master, Taylor has a resume that reads like a history of 20th&#45;century dance. He got his start performing under Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham and George Balanchine, and his Paul Taylor Dance Company has featured Twyla Tharp, Laura Dean and Dan Wagoner during its 60&#45;year existence.
</p><p>He may be 84, but he has no intention of slowing down. At an age when most artists’ best work is behind them, Taylor is acclaimed for the vibrancy, relevance and power of his dances. He continues to tackle some of society’s thorniest issues. He may propel his dancers through space for the sheer beauty of it, or use them to wordlessly illuminate war, spirituality, sexuality, morality and mortality.
</p><p>"I make dances because that's what I've spent many years teaching myself to do and it's become what I'm best at," he told the Washington Post. "When the dances are good, nothing else brings me as much satisfaction."
</p><p>At the World Theater, the company will perform three familiar pieces, including the classic “Esplanade.” Also on the program are “Diggity,” a piece first performed in 1978, and “The Word,” dating from 1998.
</p><p>Tickets for the 7:30 p.m. performance range from $10 to $40 and can be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at &#40;831&#41; 582&#45;4580 or <a href="https://csumb.edu/worldtheater">online</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="https://csumb.edu/maps">World Theater</a> is located on Sixth Avenue near A Street on the CSUMB campus.
