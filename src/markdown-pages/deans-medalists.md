  Lissa Alaniz didn’t start learning English until she was 7 years old, and was
  placed in bilingual education classes in school until age 14.
</p>
<p>
  “I didn’t mind getting extra help, but I was never given the opportunity to
  try regular or advanced classes. They never once asked me what I wanted to do
  for myself. I felt voiceless,” Alaniz said. “The day I was finally able to
  challenge myself, I began thriving.”
</p>
<p>
  Alaniz is committed to helping marginalized populations in the education
  system “because I was one of those youth,” she said.
</p>
<p>
  A first-generation student, Alaniz graduated from from CSUMB in just three
  years with a 3.97 GPA and will next pursue a master’s degree in social work.
</p>
<p>
  At CSUMB, Alaniz took on multiple leadership roles. She worked for the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/studentlife/first-year-experience/"
    >First Year Experience (FYE)</a
  >
  office as an orientation leader and intern. She hired and trained other
  orientation leaders and planned the program’s first Spanish orientation
  program for transfer student parents and supporters.
</p>
<p>
  “This is evidence not only of her awareness of needs on campus, but also her
  willingness to dive in and create new programs to respond to them,” said Derek
  Gutierrez, FYE coordinator. “Lissa is an innovative leader, always seeking to
  create new ideas and experiences that support a multitude of people.”
</p>
<p>
  Alaniz also served on the Campus Traditions Committee, contributing to key
  events including Homecoming and “Otter Days” for new and returning students.
  She was a student advising assistant in
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/upwardbound/">CSUMB’s Upward Bound Program</a>, and
  volunteered as an advocate at The Epicenter in Salinas, a youth-led program
  for transition-age foster youth.
</p>
<p>
  “I have met so many people who have been such an inspiring support system,”
  Alaniz said. “My future goal is to inspire the younger generations in
  believing in themselves and their dreams.”

<p><b>Mayra Guadalupe Gonzalez, Liberal Studies</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Mayra Guadalupe Gonzalez believes in “the amazing potential that every human
  possesses.” A first-generation college graduate, she aspires to a career as an
  elementary school teacher to help students achieve their goals and dreams.
</p>
<p>
  “Students are capable of expanding their knowledge and learning no matter
  their background, what language they speak, or where they come from,” she
  said.
</p>
<p>
  Gonzalez graduated magna cum laude from CSUMB with a bachelor’s degree in
  liberal studies. In the fall, she will begin CSUMB’s<b> </b>postbaccalaureate
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/liberalstudies/teacher-pathway-program/"
    >Teacher Pathway Program</a
  >
  in elementary education to earn a teaching credential.
</p>
<p>
  Gonzalez grew up in South Monterey County and attended Greenfield High School.
  Her interest in teaching began then when she volunteered with the non-profit
  organization Girls, Inc. to provide support for young girls in the community.
</p>
<p>
  During her final year of high school, she started a small program to provide
  tutoring and literacy lessons to students, because she knew many of them were
  growing up in non-English speaking families. After high school, Gonzalez went
  to Mexico for a year and worked as a tutor teaching English as a second
  language in public schools. These experiences grew her passion for working
  with students, specifically students in low-income communities, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Gonzalez earned an associate’s degree in elementary education at Hartnell
  College in 2017 before transferring to CSUMB. During her time at Hartnell, she
  worked with preschool children at the Child Development Center and with middle
  and high school students interested in pursuing higher education through the
  UC Santa Cruz Gear Up Program. She continued working with students as a peer
  mentor for the Teacher Pathway Program at CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  “I want every single child in my community, and in similar communities, to
  know that there are no limits for the goals they set for themselves and that
  they can aim for the stars,” she said. “All students are capable of much more
  than what society believes they can accomplish.”
