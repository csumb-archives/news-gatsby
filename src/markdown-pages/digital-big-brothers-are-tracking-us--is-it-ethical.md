<h3>Forum explores issues of data mining as we enter the cloud</h3><p>Every time we click on a website, pay for something with a credit card or drive across a toll bridge using FastTrak, we leave a digital trail. Who’s paying attention to that trail? It's not just Big Brother Government; it's also Big Brother Google, Big Brother Target and Big Brother Facebook. It's called data mining and it happens because our digital data is valuable, especially when it's viewed demographically.
</p><p>As our digital culture embraces the promises of cloud computing and doing almost everything online, is it possible for individuals to retain any sense of privacy? That’s the topic that will be discussed at the annual Ethics Forum sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay’s schools of Business and School of Computing and Design. The free event will be held from 3 to 5 p.m. on March 28 in the University Center on Sixth Avenue and B Street. Panelists include Lee Tien, senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation; Alec Arago from Congressman Sam Farr’s office; William Boogess (retired) from the Defense Manpower Data Center; Adam Swidler of Google; and Cheryl Washington, information security officer for the University of California system. Chip Lenno, CSUMB’s chief information officer, will moderate the panel. <em>Illustration: Prospect Magazine</em>
