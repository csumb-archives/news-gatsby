<p>Led by women’s disc golf club president Traci Alger, a dozen volunteers – mostly from CSUMB – created a course at Los Arboles Middle School in Marina earlier this month.</p><p>Alger worked with the city and the local Rotary Club to build the nine&#45;hole course. When the school isn’t using it, the course will be available to the public, free of charge.

School officials told the Monterey County Weekly they might add another nine holes if the course proves popular.

The Otter women won the <a href="https://csumb.edu/discgolf">National Collegiate Disc Golf championship</a> last April in North Augusta, South Carolina, beating the University of Oregon by a single throw. It was the closest match in the championship's nine&#45;year history.

Disc golf isn't an NCAA sport, so these student&#45;athletes study, practice and compete in near obscurity. The sport is growing in the college ranks – the 2015 national championships attracted 61 men’s teams and six women’s teams. CSUMB has two full&#45;length disc golf courses on campus.
