<p>The putting greens are a little bumpy, the "holes" stand five feet above ground and the fairways are far from manicured. But the greens fees are free and golf shoes aren't required. The disc golf courses at California State University, Monterey Bay won't remind anyone of Pebble Beach, but for disc golfers, the 36 holes of the Oaks and Cypress courses are magical.
</p><p>The university's Disc Golf Club invites the public to attend the West Coast College Open on Saturday, Nov. 10, when the Otters take on a team from UC-Santa Cruz. The first disc flies at 9 a.m. on the Cypress Course. The afternoon round will be played on the Oaks Course starting at 1 p.m.
</p><p>This will be only the second time on the West Coast that two universities have officially played each other in disc golf. CSUMB has hosted professional tournaments for the last nine years, but there has been only one other intercollegiate tournament.
</p><p>The hope is eventually to have a regional league involving UC-Santa Cruz, San Jose State, Santa Clara, San Francisco State and CSUMB.
</p><p>A schedule for Saturday's tournament, a map and parking directions are available at clubs.csumb.edu/discgolf.
