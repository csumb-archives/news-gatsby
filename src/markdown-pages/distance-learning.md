<h2>
  Transition to virtual classes successful thanks to innovation, cooperation,
  community
</h2>
<p><b> By Sophia Huang McKenzie</b></p>

<p>
  When CSU Monterey Bay moved to limited campus operations in March to slow the
  spread of COVID-19, all classes shifted to virtual instruction in just one
  week.
</p>
<p>
  Chief Information Officer Chip Lenno reported that between 500 to 800
  videoconference meetings took place daily in the first week of distance
  learning. More than 480 instructors taught over 7,600 students on Zoom, the
  videoconferencing service contracted with the California State University
  (CSU) system
</p>
<p>
  Historically innovative and a leader in online learning, CSUMB was better
  prepared than many institutions to make the change. In recent years, CSUMB was
  among the first CSU campuses to offer degrees through Cal State Online, a
  system-wide initiative launched in 2013 to expand access to fully online
  bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
</p>
<p>
  The university announced on May 12 that virtual instruction will continue
  through the summer session and the fall 2020 semester, with "very limited
  exceptions."
</p>
<p>
  “In my department, we feel like we've been preparing for this for 25 years!
  The
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/cat/">Center for Academic Technologies</a> (CAT)
  has been offering teacher training, workshops and support in one form or
  another since the university opened,” said Jeff McCall, center director.
</p>
<p>
  He described the CAT team as “without a doubt the finest group of
  professionals I could hope for. They’ve worked tirelessly and patiently with
  faculty to train them, guide them, and frequently console them. All of the
  success is theirs.”
</p>
<p><b>Care for Students</b></p>
<p>
  Perhaps most importantly, the university’s sense of community and the
  faculty’s care for students proved invaluable in successfully moving to remote
  teaching and learning.
</p>
<p>
  “Amid the confusion and uncertainty college students and faculty across the
  U.S. and abroad were experiencing during the early announcements about
  COVID-19, CSUMB’s faculty got it right by making the care and concern for
  their students the No. 1 priority,” said Vivian Waldrup-Patterson, director of
  the university’s
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/tla"
    >Center for Teaching, Learning and Assessment </a
  >(TLA).
</p>
<p>
  Waldrup-Patterson, McCall and Dan Shapiro, interim associate vice president
  for Academic Planning and Institutional Effectiveness, have led CSUMB’s
  transition to distance learning.
</p>
<p>
  “Without a doubt, what has gotten us this far has been the caring of faculty
  for their students. There's a huge sense of community that existed before this
  crisis and it persists. Even though we're a 'grown-up' university, there's
  still the feeling of a small town,” McCall said.
</p>
<p>
  When shelter-at-home orders were issued, McCall’s team received an email about
  a student whose roommates moved out and took all the dishes and furniture,
  along with the internet modem and router.
</p>
<p>
  “Not one, but several people came together and dropped off things to help. We
  also connected the student with the Care Team. I'm sure there are many stories
  like that,” McCall said.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s Care Team, a department of the Office of Student Life, provides
  coordinated assistance and support to students in distress.
</p>
<p><b>Working Together</b></p>
<p>
  McCall, Waldrup-Patterson and Shapiro have been meeting daily to develop and
  deliver best practices, resources, training and workshops, and to provide
  ongoing support to faculty.
</p>
<p>
  “In addition to CAT’s amazing instructional designer support staff, a group of
  faculty mentors was assembled to offer additional one-on-one technology and
  teaching and learning guidance and support,” Waldrup-Patterson said.
</p>
<p>
  They’ve also continued regular meetings via Zoom with CSUMB President Eduardo
  M. Ochoa, Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and others at department and
  college levels to share information and keep important campus initiatives
  moving forward.
</p>
<p>
  Ochoa praised the faculty’s efforts in a video message soon after the changes
  took place.
</p>
<p>
  “I understand that the faculty are having to cope with a transition that is
  unprecedented in scope and speed in terms of modalities of instruction. It’s
  all a tremendous challenge, but people have really taken a very positive, can
  do collaborative attitude. I’m just really awed by your dedication and your
  heart,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  Waldrup-Patterson and McCall both expressed gratitude for colleagues at the
  CSU Chancellor’s Office and at CSUMB’s 22 sister campuses who have proven to
  be tremendous resources.
</p>
<p>
  “Not a week goes by that I don’t talk to several of them, getting and giving
  mentorship, sharing ideas and strategies. I’m truly in awe of the skills,
  knowledge, and professionalism of this group,” McCall said.
</p>
<p><b>Multiple Resources</b></p>
<p>
  To help CSUMB faculty, the TLA and CAT created a
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/cat/keep-teaching/">Keep Teaching homepage</a> as a
  centralized repository for resources, best practices, articles, training,
  workshop schedules and more. The centers also began to circulate a weekly
  newsletter to help faculty stay in touch, share new information, and solicit
  feedback from one another.
</p>
<p>
  The newsletter includes resources for faculty on supporting themselves and
  their students, improving remote teaching, and using remote learning
  technologies, as well as resources on creating equitable and inclusive remote
  learning environments, Waldrup-Pattersons said.
</p>
<p>
  For students, the Keep Calm and Otter On(line) toolkit, available at the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/tla">TLA homepage</a>, provides resources,
  information, and best practices. Students who need computers or have wi-fi
  issues can receive assistance from the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/studentlife">Dean of Students</a>. The
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/clc">Cooperative Learning Center</a> now offers
  tutoring services online, and the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/library/">CSUMB library</a> holds a large
  collection of digital materials always accessible online.
</p>
<p><b>What’s Next</b></p>
<p>
  As the spring semester draws to a close, Waldrup-Patterson said students,
  faculty and staff will have a chance to “take a few deep breaths” and “reflect
  on the remote learning experience.”
</p>
<p>What’s next?</p>
<p>
  “Keep what worked and eliminate what did not. Get the training and support
  that is needed, incorporate the lessons learned,” she said. “Press the reset
  button, then ‘Keep Teaching and Keep Learning’ in accordance with CSUMB's
  mission, vision, and commitment to our students.”
