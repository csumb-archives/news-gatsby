<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s Global Studies program and the Bahá'í Faith communities of Monterey County will host a screening and discussion of the film, “To Light a Candle.” The free event will be held at 6:30 p.m., March 5, in the University Center ballroom.</p><p>The documentary was made by award&#45;winning filmmaker and journalist <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046867/">Maziar Bahari</a>. Through dozens of interviews, it tells the story of Bahá'ís who have lost family members over the last three decades due to ongoing religious persecution. It gives a vivid picture of a community that has been silenced and oppressed for its religious beliefs.
</p><p>The Bahá'ís are Iran’s largest religious minority. Because of their faith, they are barred from teaching and studying at universities. The Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education was established in 1987, offering classes in homes, via mail and online. The Iranian government regularly raids the classes, arresting students and teachers.
</p><p>Bahari is a former <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/authors/maziar&#45;bahari">Newsweek correspondent</a> in Tehran, and the author of the memoir "And Then They Came After Me," which was <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/interview&#45;rosewater&#45;bahari&#45;maziar/26694770.html">adapted for the screen by Jon Stewart</a>. Following Iran's 2009 presidential election, Bahari was arrested and detained for more than four months in Iran's most notorious prison. Right after his release, he left Tehran to join his family in London where he continues to live and work.
