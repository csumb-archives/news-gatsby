  has secured a Department of Defense (DoD) grant that will help fund enhanced
  technology used in fog collection research at CSUMB. The award, totaling
  $266,589, was granted through the DoD’s Research and Education Program for
  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the Minority-Serving
  Institutions (HBCU/MSI) Equipment/Instrumentation grant.
</p>
<p>
  The study associated with the grant aims to learn more about the processes
  that lead to advective fog events along coastal California and to conduct
  field tests to determine the efficiencies of the mesh-based devices used
  worldwide to collect water as a function of different environmental
  conditions.
</p>
<p>
  The new devices funded by the grant will support Fernandez, who holds a
  doctorate of philosophy in electrical engineering, in his current fog water
  collection research and will help to both measure and increase the amount of
  water collected from fog capture.
</p>

  “I am thrilled to have received this support to enhance our current research
  efforts. We live in a region where coastal fog is an important aspect of our
  place. It makes sense that this effort is taking place here and that it can
  also involve our students who then get to experience the fog both personally,
  while attending CSUMB, and by participating in state-of-the-art research
  involving fog,” said Fernandez. “This grant will allow the purchase of several
  top-of the-line instruments. We will be buying two FM-120 fog droplet
  measurement devices. There are only 106 of these so far worldwide and they
  provide an unprecedented measurement of fog characteristics that will bring
  the research into fog that we do at CSUMB to an entirely new level.”
</p>
<p>
  The research has several facets that draw broad community interest, including
  that of the DoD. The first is that fog collection can produce usable water for
  drinking or irrigation, which may be particularly useful for people, including
  military personnel, in remote foggy regions or areas that lack access to
  water. The second aspect is that this research aims to expand knowledge about
  the generation and dissipation of fog.
</p>
<p>
  This information is critically important for airports and other locations
  where fog density can adversely affect transportation and other activities. It
  can also provide insight on the phenomena associated with both the development
  and dissipation of clouds.
</p>
<p>
  "The presence of fog affects visibility and can impact Army operations,” said
  Julia Barzyk, who holds a doctorate of philosophy in geophysical sciences and
  is the program manager for Earth Materials and Processes at the Army Research
  Office. “We are excited that this award will enable the science needed to
  mitigate those effects as well as provide opportunities to develop the next
  generation of scientists."
</p>
<p>
  Fernandez has been involved in fog water collection since 2005. His work has
  integrated over 50 undergraduate students and two graduate students since he
  began, and his group has deployed research-grade standard fog collectors at
  over 25 sites throughout California. He has presented at dozens of conferences
  and other public presentations and has authored or co-authored 10 different
  conference or journal papers related to the topic of fog water collection.
</p>
<p>
  The award is the result of a merit competition administered by the Army
  Research Office under policy and guidance of the Office of the Under Secretary
  of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&amp;E)), to increase the
  capabilities of HBCU/MSIs to perform defense research. The Army Research
  Office is an element of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development
  Command’s Army Research Laboratory.
