<p>A donor wall, memorializing the contributions of significant donors to the university, was unveiled Oct. 9 at the Alumni &amp; Visitors Center during an annual dinner in appreciation of the university’s largest donors.
</p><p>The wall contains the names of 120 donors, both individuals and organizations, with room for many more to be added in the years to come. Each name signifies a cumulative donation of $25,000 or more. The wall lists various “society” giving levels, ranging from $25,000 to over the $10 million level.
</p><p>“The donor wall will be updated with new names each year,” said Pilar Gose, annual giving officer in University Advancement. “When the wall was unveiled at the donor dinner, the guests who were recognized for their generosity really loved it.”
</p><p>An existing donor wall in the lobby of the University Center also lists donations, but it has not been updated since 2006. It will remain there, but will no longer be the memorial of record for future contributions.
