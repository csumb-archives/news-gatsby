<p>Students passing by Valley Hall at CSU Monterey Bay stop and stare as women throw air punches: right hammer fist, left shield. One kicks a bag with a thud and yells "No!" Another sends a push kick to a bag, yelling "Stay back!" The women drawing all the attention were participating in a Rape Aggression Defense program – called RAD – run by CSUMB police officers. – <em>Monterey County Weekly</em>, Oct. 18, 2012
