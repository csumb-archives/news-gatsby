</p><p>Well-organized chaos was the scene at CSU Monterey Bay Aug. 21 as many of the nearly 1,900 students who live on campus wheeled, carried and dragged their belongings into the residence halls that will be their home for the next year.
</p><p>"This is one of the two best days in the year – commencement is the other," President Dianne Harrison said as she greeted new students and their parents.
</p><p>About 100 faculty, staff and students volunteered for the Otter Welcome Team. They helped direct traffic, answered questions, carried boxes and gave directions to the new students – most of whom had parents and siblings along to help.
</p><p>Across the campus quad, the completely renovated Dining Commons opened for the first time. With the look and feel of a restaurant, the revamped and upgraded facility is bigger and has a redesigned serving area with new food stations where diners can watch as their food is prepared. It incorporates energy efficient design, such as more windows and skylights for natural lighting.
</p><p>The incoming class includes 925 freshmen and 538 transfer students. Total enrollment is approximately 4,300; about a third of them come from Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.
