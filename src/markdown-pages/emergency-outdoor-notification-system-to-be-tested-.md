<p>CSUMB will test its new outdoor emergency notification system at 11:50 a.m. today. </p><p>Like all of the university's emergency communication tools, the outdoor notification system will be tested on a regular basis to ensure it is working properly and to help familiarize the campus community with how it will operate in an emergency. Tests will be held on the fourth Friday of each month, around 11:50 a.m.
</p><p>During the test, the system will broadcast a tone, followed by a voice message over speakers located near the World Languages and Cultures North building, the Dining Commons and the Aquatic Center. The alert tones are loud and distinct and should be easily heard by anyone who is outdoors on the main campus.
</p><p>Other <a href="https://csumb.edu/police/emergency&#45;procedures">emergency communication methods</a> the university has in place include <a href="https://csumb.edu/police/personal&#45;safety&#45;0">OtterAlert text messages</a>, emergency messaging via the web, e&#45;mail distribution, and a telephone hotline featuring a recorded message at 582&#45;5044.
