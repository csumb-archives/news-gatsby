<p>CSU Monterey Bay kicked off the spring semester on Jan. 25 with a staff and faculty appreciation breakfast, and even a massive snowstorm didn’t derail the event.
</p><p>President Eduardo Ochoa and Provost Bonnie Irwin were forced to miss the breakfast when their flights were cancelled due to the storm that hit Washington, D.C., where they were attending an academic conference. Other administrations filled in and the breakfast went on as planned.

</p><p>Reading remarks prepared by Dr. Irwin, Dean Ilene Feinman told the group that everyone plays an important role in helping students succeed and thrive “whether you see students every day or not. Some of you rarely see a student, yet the work you do allows that student to get their classes, access the Internet, have a place to live and learn, see a concert, pay their bill, work out an academic or personal problem.”
</p><p>Kevin Saunders, vice president for Administration and Finance and head of the University Corporation, reminded the gathering “my groups are the unsung heroes. They’re behind the scenes, but they keep the university humming.” He was referring to the campus police department, parking, facilities, campus planning and development, payroll, housing and dining services, among others.
</p><p>VP for Student Affairs and Enrollment Services Ronnie Higgs sounded a similar theme. “When we do our jobs well in Student Affairs, you don’t hear about us,” he said. Among the offices he mentioned were the Campus Service Center, Financial Aid, Student Conduct and the Dean of Students.

</p><p>Andre Lewis, associate vice president for University Affairs, brought the breakfast to a close. “I hope that each of you can find a little time in your busy day to reach out to a colleague who is doing good work, and tell him or her that those efforts are appreciated,” he said.
