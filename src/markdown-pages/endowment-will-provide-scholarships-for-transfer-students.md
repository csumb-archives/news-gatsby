<p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received $500,000 in scholarship endowment funds from the Bernard Osher Foundation of San Francisco. The gift is part of the foundationâ€™s initiative for California community college students, launched in 2008. As part of that initiative, gifts are being made to support scholarships for students who transfer from two-year state community colleges to a CSU or UC campus. Starting in the 2013-14 school year, the endowment will provide CSUMB transfer students with funds they can use for tuition, books or living expenses. CSUMB has received previous donations from the Osher Foundation to fund the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute on campus. The foundation has funded a network of lifelong learning institutes across the country to provide innovative learning opportunities to serve the intellectual and cultural needs of older adults.
