<p>In honor of the 25th anniversary of Godfrey Reggio’s conservation documentary, “Anima Mundi,” students in CSU Monterey Bay’s environmental filmmaking class have created documentaries that will be shown on March 23 at the Monterey Museum of Art’s La Mirada location.</p><p>"Anima Mundi" is a celebration set to music – by Philip Glass – of the diversity among nature and the importance of every species. The quick&#45;moving film deals with life forms moving and standing still.
</p><p>Made for the World Wildlife Foundation, "Anima Mundi"makes a loud statement without uttering a single word.
</p><p>The five student documentaries, created by Joey Cloud, Allyson Dudzinski, Cristian Duran, Austin Fontanilla, Megan Mason, Allison Nunes, Annette Prieto, Stephen Terry and Chris Vinson, examine the fate of these species over the last 25 years.
</p><p>The Environmental Media Arts class attracts science students as well as those enrolled in Cinematic Arts and Technology program. Through a series of explorations and adventures, students in the arts and sciences create media arts projects with environmental themes or topics, while working across disciplines.
</p><p>The museum is located at 720 Via Mirada, Monterey. The program will get under way at 6 p.m. and run about an hour. General admission tickets are $10; students with ID are free.
