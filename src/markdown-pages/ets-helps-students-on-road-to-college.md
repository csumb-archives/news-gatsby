<p>VIDEO IN RUNNING FOR NATIONAL HONOR</p><p>Madeleine Maurer moved to Seaside from Houston during her junior year in high school. “When I came here, I was clueless. I had no idea about higher education in California,” she said, adding that she was confused about the difference between the CSU and UC systems.
</p><p>“Educational Talent Search served as a helping hand, getting me ready to go to college.”
</p><p>Madeleine is one of nearly 1,200 high school students who start down the path to college each year through the Educational Talent Search program based at CSU Monterey Bay. The students attend seven high schools in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties.
</p><p>Talent Search gives first&#45;generation, low&#45;income students and their families information about college admissions and resources, provides students with academic advising, helps them explore careers, exposes them to cultural events and helps students become college&#45;ready.
</p><p>The federally funded program was part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Higher Education Act of 1965, established with the goal of seeing that “no American talent is wasted.”
</p><p>To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Talent Search, ETS programs across the nation had the opportunity to create a video to highlight the impact the program has had on students, families, communities and schools. CSUMB’s video was selected as a finalist.
</p><p>“Please take the time to watch our students’ stories,” said Clementina Macias, ETS program coordinator at CSUMB. “We have until Friday, July 24, to get as many people as possible to LIKE our video on YouTube.”
</p><p>The winning video will be announced on Aug. 5 and highlighted at the Council for Opportunity in Education’s annual conference Sept. 16&#45;19 in Atlanta.
