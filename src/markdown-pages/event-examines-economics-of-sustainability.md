</p><h3>Smoothies pedaled at event are just tip of iceberg</h3><p>On Feb. 16, California State University, Monterey Bay will host the fourth annual Focus the Region event, a daylong teach-in on environmental issues. This year’s theme is the Economics of Sustainability. Exhibits will be set up at 8:30 a.m. in the University Center. Registration opens at 9:30. Speakers will start at 10:50. A complimentary lunch will be available after the speakers. The afternoon session will feature four panel discussions on green building, transportation, food and a session on student initiatives at local colleges. Speakers include Dr. Jason Scorse of the Monterey Institute of International Studies, author of “What Environmentalists Need to Know About the Economy”; Dr. Brad Barbeau of CSUMB (pictured at right), who will speak on the topic, “Was Malthus Right?” and Rebecca Costa, author of “The Watchman’s Rattle.” Jim Fowler will be on hand throughout the day to demonstrate his “fender blender,” a bicycle-powered blender he uses to make fruit smoothies. An attachment clips to the back of the bike; when the rear wheel turns, it spins the blender mechanism – a creative way to conserve energy. The day’s activities – including lunch – are free. Those wishing to stay for lunch are asked to <a href="http://rsvp.csumb.edu">RSVP</a>.
