<p>In July, 10 students from Cal State Monterey Bay will head overseas as participants in the Japanese Exchange and Teaching Program, better known as JET.</p><p>The program is an effort by the Japanese government to promote internationalization at the local level by bringing young, college&#45;educated people to work in communities throughout the country.
</p><p>Heading to Japan are Christian McGlothlin&#45;Clason, Kiara McLaurin, Alexander Castillo, Addie Gingold, D’Andre Thompson, Andrew Ramirez, Andrew Elisalde, Mary McElroy, Kristen Simonsen and Selena Miranda. All but Simonsen and Miranda are Japanese Language and Culture majors.
</p><p>“This is a record&#45;breaking number for CSUMB,” said Professor Shigeko Sekine. “We had a 100 percent acceptance rate from our study group, and I'm proud of them.”
</p><p>Participants work as language teachers or in government offices.
</p><p>Gingold will serve as a coordinator for international relations &#40;CIR&#41; at a government office, the first CSUMB student to be accepted in that role. CIRs interpret for foreign officials and visitors and work on sister&#45;city relations, among other duties.
</p><p>The other nine students will work as assistant language teachers, helping with English classes, working on teaching materials and assisting with extracurricular activities such as English clubs.
</p><p>The initial placement is for one year, although it can be renewed.
</p><p>While language proficiency isn’t required for the teaching positions, all of the CSUMB students have studied Japanese at the university. Some of them have already spent time in Japan and are eager to return.
</p><p>“What appeals to me most is being able to live among Japanese people,” Thompson said. “When I studied in Japan for a year, I had one of the best adventures of my life. To be able to live and work there was my goal. And I wanted to make my Sensei &#40;teacher&#41; proud.”
</p><p>McGlothlin&#45;Clason is another student who has experience in Japan. “After spending a year studying at Okayama University, I fell in love with the country,” she said. “I have enjoyed sharing my love for language and culture with people, so I look forward to helping children to learn a foreign language.”
</p><p>Placements are competitive. According to the JET website, 2,695 Americans served with the program last year.
