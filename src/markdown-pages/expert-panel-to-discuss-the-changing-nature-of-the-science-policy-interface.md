  SEASIDE, Ca., April 30, 2019 -- California State University, Monterey Bay’s
  (CSUMB) James W. Rote Distinguished Professorship in Marine Science &amp;
  Policy program will host a panel of science policy experts to discuss the
  changing nature of the science-policy interface in our nation, state and
  region on
  <b>Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at CSUMB’s Alumni and Visitor Center from 6-8 p.m</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The event, titled “<a href="https://csumb.edu/marinescience"
    >Evolving or Devolving? The Changing Nature of the Science-Policy
    Interface</a
  >,” will examine how the role of science in public policy has changed and how
  it will evolve in the future.
</p>
<p>
  “It is no secret that the role of science in society, or at least in public
  policy, has changed in the past few years, particularly at the national level.
  It has never been more important for us, as scientists and stewards of the
  environment, to understand the relationship between science and policy, and
  how to facilitate the integration of the two.” said CSUMB Marine Science Chair
  &amp; Rote Professor, James Lindholm. “Drawing on the deep experience of our
  three distinguished guests, we will explore how the endeavor of translating
  science to policy has changed over the years and what the future holds.”

<p>
  This presentation is hosted and sponsored by the James W. Rote Distinguished
  Professorship in Marine Science &amp; Policy.

  The Rote Professorship has a strong foundation in the community. It supports
  annual and recurring events such as the Ocean Candidates Forum, workshops on
  science communication and invited speakers on a wealth of topics. It also
  funds undergraduate and graduate students conducting research on applied
  topics, as well as faculty research being conducted in support of governance
  at state, federal and international levels.
</p>
<p>
  Hosting open community events is in keeping with CSUMB’s role as a community
  resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought
  and action on issues important to our community.
