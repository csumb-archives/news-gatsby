<p>In January, Dr. Yoshiko Saito&#45;Abbott will become president of the American Association of Teachers of Japanese.  She was elected to the position after serving two years as vice president&#45;secretary of the organization.

Dr. Saito&#45;Abbott is professor and chair of the School of World Languages and Cultures at CSU Monterey Bay, where she has been on the faculty since 1996.

The American Association of Teachers of Japanese works to promote study of the language and broaden knowledge and appreciation of Japan and its culture. Its 1,500 members represent every state as well as Canada, Australia, Europe and Japan.
