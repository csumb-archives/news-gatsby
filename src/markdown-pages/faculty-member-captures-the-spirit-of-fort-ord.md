<p>Fort Ord – once the largest military base in the American West – was a vital center during much of the 20th century. More than a million people lived and worked at the base. But that was two decades ago; now, many people know it only as a ghost town that surrounds CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>That otherworldly quality has inspired Enid Ryce, chair of the university’s Cinematic Arts and Technology Department, to create Planet Ord, a project that explores the contemporary experience and historical echoes of the base. It’s an artist’s view of abandoned buildings and the artwork that adorns many of them; it’s also a tribute to those who served at Fort Ord. Its goal: to understand the fort’s history by immortalizing the buildings and community memories. The Planet Ord project will be on display throughout November at the Seaside, King City and Marina branches of the Monterey County Free Libraries &#40;MCFL&#41;. The exhibit features photos and painted maps that depict the fort’s history and showcase the many ethereal murals found there. An interactive portion allows visitors to share their memories of Fort Ord. An artist’s reception and talk will be held at each library.
</p><p>• Seaside, 550 Harcourt Ave.: Nov. 8, 3 p.m.
</p><p>• King City, 402 Broadway St.: Nov. 15, 3 p.m.
</p><p>• Marina, 190 Seaside Circle: Nov. 22, 2:30 p.m At each talk, Ryce will give a multimedia presentation on the long&#45;decommissioned base, and show films made by her students. The Planet Ord exhibits and talks are supported by War Comes Home, an initiative from Cal Humanities. “The images presented by Planet Ord are powerful and evoke emotions that tell the stories of many local veterans,” said Jenna Severson, MCFL programming librarian. <a href="http://planetord.com">Learn more about Planet Ord</a>
