</p><p>Two CSUMB scientists will make presentations at the California and the World Ocean Conference Sept. 7-10 in San Francisco.
</p><p>The conference focuses on management, policy, assessment and communication regarding marine and ocean issues. It was organized by California's Ocean Protection Council, Natural Resources Agency and Environmental Protection Agency.
</p><p>Underscoring the role strong science plays in developing sound policy and informed management, the panels include 40 researchers from 18 universities. Among them are James Lindholm (pictured at left) and Rikk Kvitek.
</p><p>Presentations will address ocean and coastal subjects that can be applied to resource management and policy. Topics such as climate change impacts, marine protected areas, regional ocean governance, and renewable offshore energy will be featured. Dr. Lindholm, Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine Science and Policy at CSUMB, is part of a session that will deal with management plans for overfished populations, and how to assess the indirect impacts of various fishing practices.
</p><p>Dr. Kvitek (at right), director of the university's Seafloor Mapping Lab, is one of the researchers who will present California's seafloor mapping program as a model for collaboration and partnership. The session will provide examples of ways in which seafloor data are being applied to assist the design and monitoring of marine protected areas, explore the threats from earthquakes and tsunamis, and understand sediment transport and sand delivery among other topics.
