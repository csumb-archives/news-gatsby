</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay lecturer John Wineglass is an award&#45;winning composer and musician who has traveled the world since he was 11 years old.
</p><p>He'll tell you he owes it all to an opportunity afforded him as a youngster growing up in Washington, D.C.
</p><p>"Without question, the D.C. Youth Orchestra changed my life," Wineglass said.
</p><p>Wineglass, who teaches classes in the university's Music and Performing Arts Department, traveled with the orchestra to Yugoslavia, Russia, China, Puerto Rico and Korea.
</p><p>"The experience got me hooked on music and travel."
</p><p>"Hooked" might be an understatement. It led him to earn a bachelor's degree in music composition at American University, and a master's degree in composition for motion pictures, television and multi&#45;media at New York University.
</p><p>So when the youth orchestra asked him to compose a piece for its 50th anniversary celebration at the Kennedy Center on Aug. 21, he seized the opportunity. Despite the short notice – he had only two months to work on the five&#45;minute piece – he was eager to contribute to the program.
</p><p>The concert featured an orchestra made up of alumni of the program, under the direction of National Symphony pops conductor Marvin Hamlisch and the youth orchestra's director, Jesus Manuel Berard.
</p><p>A concert review in the Washington Post singled Wineglass out for praise.
</p><p>According to the Post's music critic, Cecelia Porter, Berard  "drew from the group iridescent colors in the premiere of a beautifully crafted suite by DCYO alumnus John Wineglass."
</p><p>The composer was also the featured violinist for the piece, one of 110 alumni orchestra members who performed that night.
</p><p>"Performing that night was the culmination of my years growing up in the orchestra . . . and bridging that gap with my current career as a concert&#45;hall composer and film/TV composer," he said a few days after the concert.
</p><p>"It was quite literally living in two worlds. Playing took me back to my childhood, but the piece that we were playing was composed by me – bringing me to the present. It was exhilarating!"
</p><p>Wineglass' passion for music has also led him to develop proficiency as a contemporary jazz and gospel pianist. He serves as music director for Shoreline Community Church.
</p><p>He's been nominated for seven Daytime Emmy Awards and has won a trio of them, in the category ofOutstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series; he's also won three ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards.
</p><p>And he's performed for every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan &#40;not to mention other world leaders, including former King Hussein of Jordan and President Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union&#41;.
</p><p>At CSUMB, he teaches music and film, composition and musicianship, and theory.
