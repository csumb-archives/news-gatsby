<p>For a mother who recently watched an offspring hatch, the red&#45;shouldered hawk that has taken up residence at the Tanimura &amp; Antle library seems to be in good shape.
</p><p>She and her partner are the proud parents of one chick, and the mother has gotten a bit protective.
</p><p>"She's swooped at someone working up there," said Mardi Chalmers, a librarian who has an interest in birds. "Hawks are aggressive in protecting their territory and their young."
</p><p>The birds have built a nest on the east side of the library, at the third&#45;floor level in an area not accessible to the public.
</p><p>For a couple of years, "there was a nest in the pine tree outside the old library building," Chalmers said. "We think they moved along with us. They're very territorial. As the crow &#45; make that hawk &#45; flies, this library isn't far from the old one."
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay construction inspector Jim Conway spotted the nest around April 20. Then, lead construction manager Ron Deller noticed debris falling from the building on a windy day.
</p><p>"I was worried that we were going to have a maintenance problem every time it was windy. I went up to third floor to investigate, and saw the nest," Deller said.
</p><p>Red&#45;shouldered hawks &#40;Buteo lineatus&#41; are found in eastern North America and along the coast of California. Adults have a brownish head and reddish chest; their tail is marked with narrow white bars. The red "shoulder" is visible when the bird is perched.
</p><p>They normally live in forested areas. The breeding pair produces three or four eggs, but typically only one "fledge" survives. The incubation period is about a month.
</p><p>The parents take turns minding the chick and finding tasty treats &#40;such as rodents, bloodied bird pieces or small snakes&#41; to drop into the baby's waiting beak. In just a few weeks, the white fuzz&#45;ball will be as big as the parents.
</p><p>The campus will have to settle for a view of the nest. The little one can't be seen from the ground, and mom and dad are mostly out of sight, either hunting or feeding the chick.
</p><p>When the chick learns to fly, the parents will drive it off. But the chick will probably stay in the area.
</p><p>Have the hawks been given names?
</p><p>On that point, Chalmers is emphatic.
</p><p>"We don't have names for them; they're not mascots," she said. "They're wild. We're admiring them from afar. We're pleased the hawks chose the library to build their nest."
