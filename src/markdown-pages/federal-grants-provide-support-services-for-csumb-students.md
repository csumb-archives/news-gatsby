<p>Cal State Monterey Bay was recently awarded a pair of grants from the U.S. Department of Education to help low-income and first-generation college students and students with disabilities complete their education.</p><p>A new five&#45;year, $1.09 million grant under the TRIO <a href="https://csumb.edu/trio">Student Support Services</a>&#40;SSS&#41; Program will assist 120 students annually in their pursuit of undergraduate degrees in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics &#40;STEM&#41; fields.The university also received a five&#45;year, $1.2 million grant renewal for its existing Student Support Services program that serves 160 students.
</p><p>Both programs will offer eligible students services such as academic advising; tutoring; counseling and career advising. The goal is to provide opportunities for academic development, assist students with basic college requirements and motivate them to graduate.
</p><p>TRIO programs were created as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide more opportunities for low&#45;income and first&#45;generation students to prepare for and enroll in college. The term TRIO was coined to describe the first three programs that were created â€“ Upward Bound, Educational Talent Search and Student Support Services. Other programs have been added over the years; the term "TRIO" now refers to all of these programs.
</p><p>The grants will start Sept. 1.
