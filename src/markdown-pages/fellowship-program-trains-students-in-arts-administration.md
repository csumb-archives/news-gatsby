<p>Two Cal State Monterey Bay students are getting the opportunity to learn how nonprofits operate through a fellowship program with the Carmel Bach Festival, and helping the festival at the same time.</p><p>Jessalyn Johnson and Avery Gould started work last September. During the school year, they spent 12 hours a week at the festival office and earned academic credit. During June and July, they become full&#45;time, paid employees.
</p><p>Dr. Lila Staples, chair of the Visual and Public Art Department, recommended them for the program. She calls it an “incredible opportunity.”

“These students are treated as part of the staff and a lot is expected of them . . . It’s invaluable learning for an emerging professional,” Dr. Staples said.

They perform a variety of tasks for the festival.

“I’m the marketing and development fellow, so I help with advertising, working with donors and fundraising,” Johnson said. She’s also helping to reorganize the festival’s archives, and since it is in its 78th year, “they have lots of work from past years,” she said.

Gould is the digital media fellow. She runs the festival’s Facebook and Twitter accounts, and has made the website more informative and interactive.

The fellowship is a two&#45;way learning experience – the students learn new skills, and the festival staff gains insight and perspective on how to connect classical music to a younger generation through the fellows’ recommendations.
</p><p>Johnson and Gould work with local schools, churches and youth choirs to help educate them about classical music. Gould points out that one way to connect young people to classical music is though social media.
</p><p>The fellowship has been “one of the highlights of my college career,” Johnson said. “Because we start at the beginning of the season and work until the end of the festival, we get to be part of every step, from creating budgets, planning events . . . we’re there for all of it. It’s been an amazing learning opportunity.”
</p><p>Gould echoed that sentiment.
</p><p>“I’ve learned how to be diplomatic and deal with people in afriendly yet professional manner. I never knew how much work goes into getting donations and planning events,” she said.
</p><p>In addition to the fellows, a third student is involved in this summer’s festival. Kai Schoneweis provided artwork and graphic design for “The Underwater Adventure of Leonard and Rasmus,” a family concert scheduled for July 25 at Carmel’s Sunset Center.
</p><p>His images will serve as backdrops throughout the show, and his work is featured on postcards, flyers and posters promoting the performance.
</p><p>This is the second year of the CSUMB&#45;Bach Festival partnership. “Our university looks forward to expanding our relationship withthe Carmel Bach Festival,” said CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa. “The festival is truly an outstanding cultural event, and CSUMB is proud to be working closely with its organizers.”
