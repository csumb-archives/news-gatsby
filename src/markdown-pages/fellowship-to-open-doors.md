<p>Todd Hallenbeck will complete his master’s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy this spring. A San Jose native, Hallenbeck is also the recipient of a Sea-Grant West Coast Governor’s Agreement Fellowship.
</p><p>This fellowship allows him to work with state and federal agencies for two years, implementing progressive regional marine policy off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.
</p><p>Hallenbeck’s master’s thesis, concerning the distribution of biological communities in soft sediment habitats of Monterey Bay, helped prepare him for that challenge.
</p><p>“This will be an incredible opportunity to witness firsthand how science translates to policy,” Hallenbeck said, “and will put to good use all the skills and experiences I have gained from being at CSUMB.”
