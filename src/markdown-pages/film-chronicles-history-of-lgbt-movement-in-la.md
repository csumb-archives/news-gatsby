</p><p>Not everything began with Stonewall.
</p><p>On April 14, filmmaker Glenne McElhinney (pictured at right) will screen her film, "On These Shoulders We Stand" at 7 p.m. in the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library, Room 1188.
</p><p>The film chronicles the lives of 11 elders, from their early years to their coming out, to their groundbreaking activism for the rights of all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people.
</p><p>Contrary to popular belief that the struggle for gay rights was confined to New York City and San Francisco, the film profiles several Los Angeles activists who helped change the course of both California and LGBT history. Viewers will learn how Los Angeles' gay community has had a national impact on issues as diverse as the First Amendment, the entertainment industry and the civil rights movement.
</p><p>"On These Shoulders We Stand" brings the marginalized and under-reported history of Los Angeles' LGBT community to a new generation of American audiences.
</p><p>A question-and-answer session will follow the screening.
</p><p>Watch the trailer <a href="http://impactstories.org/film.htm">here</a>.
</p><p>The presentation is sponsored by the Division of Humanities and Communication, Out &amp; About and the Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology.
