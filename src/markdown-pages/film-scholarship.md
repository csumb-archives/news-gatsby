"This experience honestly changed my life and gave me the certainty that documentary filmmaking is what I want to pursue. I want to work on films that bring help, hope, justice and love to people all over the world."

</p><p>The Monterey County Film Commission scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are enrolled in a college or university in the county.  The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County. The scholarship program chair is film commission board member Phyllis Decker.
