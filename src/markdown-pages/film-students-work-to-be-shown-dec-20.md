<h3>Capstone festival presents screen gems</h3><p>The World Theater stage on the campus of CSU Monterey Bay will host a stellar selection of student films at this year’s Fall Capstone Festival, scheduled for two public screenings on Dec. 20 in the World Theater. The matinee showing will begin at 1 p.m.; the program repeats at 6 o’clock. Admission is free.
</p><p>The Capstone Festival event will feature 13 professional-quality film productions spanning genres, including documentary, narrative and experimental works produced by students of CSUMB’s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department.
</p><p>The program includes Mattieu Mauthes’ THE TOME, a comedic romp through the daily life of a terminally-underemployed paranormal investigator, and Renee Infelise’s A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, a short documentary featuring award-winning writer Dustin Lance Black speaking passionately about his politically-charged play “8.”
</p><p>J. Beau Sandoval’s AGAINST THE ODDS is a compelling drama exploring the tensions between a father and daughter over her right to love whom she chooses, and Matthew DiPietro’s THE PEOPLE WATCHER is a short suburban thriller about a man whose park visits are interrupted by an ominous stranger.
</p><p>Garrett Collins’ 20 MINUTES offers an unsettling glimpse into a dystopian future where population control occurs by lottery.
</p><p>Leslie Juarez’s A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS offers an intimate portrait of a local breast cancer assistance group and Safeer Bhombal’s YELLOW PANTHERS documents the little-known history of the Asian American presence in the Black Panther Movement.
</p><p>Seleena Tesfazgi’s HOW FAR IS HAVEN traces the perilous journey of a young girl’s flight across East African borders en route to the United States, and Carolyn Janis’ gripping drama WEDNESDAY follows another journey in which a mother’s desperate choices on one violent night lead her to escape with her young daughter into an unknown and uncertain future.
</p><p>Kirsten Clapp’s SKINNY ON THE INSIDE is a serio-comic and poignant tale of female body dysmorphia and courage, and Austin Gavin’s AT EASE, SOLDIER lovingly portrays one of our community’s last family-owned and operated local bars for veterans and those who support them.
</p><p>Lindsey Wallraff’s documentary GIVEN AWAY FOR LOVE is a powerful and poetic tale of self-discovery told through the voice of an adopted young woman, and Kevin Protz’s animated comedy NIGHT OF THE LIVING FOOD devilishly depicts a world of genetically “enhanced” fruits and vegetables running amuck in the streets.
</p><p>Please note that some films in the program contain mature language or violence.
</p><p>The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue, near the intersection with A Street. Parking is free on the adjacent lot.
