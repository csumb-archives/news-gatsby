<p>‘THE HEAD OF JOAQUIN MURRIETA’ TO BE SCREENED SEPT. 10</p><p>Filmmaker John Valadez will screen his latest project, <em>The Head of Joaquin Murrieta</em>, at CSU Monterey Bay on Sept. 10.
</p><p>Valadez will show the film and answer questions starting at 4 p.m. in the Cinematic Arts and Technology studio &#40;Bldg. 27&#41; on Sixth Avenue. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Valadez has been writing, producing and directing award&#45;winning documentaries for 16 years.  Two of his films: <em>War and Peace</em>, about Latinos in World War II, and <em>Prejudice and Pride</em>, about the Chicano movement, aired on the landmark PBS documentary series Latino Americans.  His films have tackled subjects including the false imprisonment of a leader of the Black Panther Party; Latino gangs in Chicago; segregation in America’s schools; and the genocide of Native Americans in the Southwest.  He is currently completing a companion book to his Emmy nominated PBS documentary <em>The Longoria Affair.</em>

<strong>Film synopsis</strong>:  For over a decade filmmaker John Valadez searched for the remains of Joaquin Murrieta, a legendary Mexican outlaw who blazed a trail of revenge and rebellion
</p><p>following the theft of his land, and the rape and murder of his wife. In the summer of 1853, Murrieta was killed by bounty hunters, who put his head in a jar and displayed it across California, charging people a dollar to see their “trophy.”One hundred and sixty&#45;two years later, Valadez is convinced he finally has the head. He embarks on a quixotic, cross&#45;country road trip through history, memory, and myth to bury the head of Joaquin Murrieta, and finally lay to rest a dark and troubled past – one that has chilling parallels with the filmmaker's own family story.
</p><p><em>The Head of Joaquin Murrieta</em> is an irreverent, entertaining and often disturbing tale that uses both fiction and documentary storytelling devices to tear open a painful and long ignored history: the lynching of Mexican Americans in the southwest.
