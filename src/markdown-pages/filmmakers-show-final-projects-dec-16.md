<h4>Capstone Festival presents real gems</h4><p>The World Theater on the campus of CSU Monterey Bay will host student films and original media productions at the fall capstone festival, scheduled for Friday, Dec. 16 at 6 p.m. Admission is free.
</p><p>The capstone festival will feature a dozen top-quality productions spanning genres, including documentaries, animation, narrative and experimental works produced by students of CSUMB’s Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department.
</p><p>Among the highlights is a piece called Monterey Meltdown by Tara Diego. The film is a comical yet informative stop-motion animation news broadcast about drought in California, with a focus on its effects in the Monterey area.
</p><p>Also worth noting is a documentary, Derby, by Dominic Parisi. Through interviews with local participants and live action shot at local competitions, it examines the culture of women’s roller derby and how it has evolved from scripted, campy catfights to a sport that emphasizes athleticism.
</p><p>Read more about the 12 projects <a href="http://tat.csumb.edu/fall-2011">here</a>. 
</p><p>The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue near the intersection with A Street. Driving directions and campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
