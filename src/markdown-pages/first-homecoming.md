<h4>First-ever homecoming game set for Oct. 8</h4><p>Every fall, college campuses across the nation invite their alumni back for celebrations of their alma mater. It's a time to acknowledge the success of the schools and their graduates.
</p><p>From Oct. 5 through 8, CSUMB will celebrate homecoming with a parade, a bonfire, dances, and the big game. This is the first time CSUMB has held homecoming &#45; which means school traditions will be formed on the spot.
</p><p>As is customary with CSUMB, things will be done a little differently here. Instead of fancy parade floats, shopping carts decorated by student and alumni organizations will roll from the main quad to a pre&#45;game barbeque. The traditional homecoming dance will raise money to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina. And the "big game" will feature the Otter volleyball squad taking on CSU Stanislaus at 7 p.m., Oct. 8 at the Otter Sports Center.
</p><p>Homecoming events are open to alumni, students, faculty, staff and the community. Events kick off on Oct. 5 with a pep rally for Otter sports teams, and conclude on Oct. 8. A complete list of events can be found at <a href="http://csumb.edu/homecoming">http://csumb.edu/homecoming</a>.
