</p><p>Amid family&#45;friendly art workshops and marionette theater shows, hot&#45;blooded salsa grooves and buoyant swing dancing, and the pageantry and puppetry of the Twilight Process parade, is the inaugural CSUMB First Night Film Festival.
</p><p>Starting at 3:30 p.m. in the Golden State Theater on Alvarado Street, 13 short films – the longest is 11 minutes – will be screened. They include documentaries, music videos, animation and narratives.
</p><p>Among the works to be screened is a seven&#45;minute experimental film, Ella and the Astronaut, by recent graduates Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda&#45;Beck. Ella is the first in a three&#45;film series they have made exploring children's ideas of imagination and reality. The second installment, Charlie and the Rabbit, will be shown at next month's Sundance Film Festival.
</p><p>More than 70 performances are scheduled at 25 venues and locales across the city from 3 p.m. to midnight. Admission buttons are required for all indoor events. Adult prices are $15 in advance and $20 on Dec. 31; youth prices are $12 and $15. Tickets are available at a variety of locations around town and on the First Night website.
</p><p>First Night Monterey, now in its 17th year, is an alcohol&#45;free New Year's Eve community arts celebration designed for all ages.
