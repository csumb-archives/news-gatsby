</p><p>Humans have always told fish stories.
</p><p>Ten of these fascinating stories are told in an exhibit on display at the Museum of Monterey during February.
</p><p>Jennifer Colby, a faculty member in CSUMB’s Liberal Studies Department, is the guest curator for this exhibit and three others to follow. All deal with the theme Fishing 2014.
</p><p>The current exhibit, "Fish Stories," features her own artwork and the illustrations of Amadeo Bachar, who teaches in CSUMB’s science Illustration program.
</p><p>Dr. Colby's prints are paired with the text of stories about the native Rumsen, early Spanish missions, whalers from the Azores, squid fishermen from China, salmon fishermen and abalone divers from Japan, "Pop" Ernest and the "Abalone Song," and Sicilian sardine fishermen. Each print is a collagraph monotype on Rives BFK paper.
