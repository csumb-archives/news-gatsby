<p>Class work is done in class, homework is done at home. That's the way it's always been. But imagine that model flipped: the traditional classroom experience – like sitting through a lecture – happens at home, while homework is done in class. It's called the "inverted classroom," and it's a strategy more colleges, including CSUMB, are using. –* Monterey County Weekly*, July 4, 2013
