<h3>Kicks off March 4 with talk on economic development</h3><p>With the theme, “Flourish Monterey County,” this year’s President’s Speaker Series at California State University, Monterey Bay will get under way on March 4 when Mary Jo Waits visits campus.
</p><p>Ms. Waits, director of the Economic, Human Services and Workforce Division of the National Governors Association, was one of the most thought-provoking speakers at the recent colloquium on Fort Ord redevelopment. She will expand on her ideas on how to leverage university research to enhance economic development.
</p><p>One of the messages that emerged from the colloquium was the need to move beyond jurisdictional battles and take a comprehensive look at what makes economic and environmental sense for the area. In her talk, Ms. Waits will continue the discussion begun at the colloquium.
</p><p>Her presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling the World Theater box office at 582-4580, or going online at csumb.edu/rsvp.
</p><p>The series continues on March 28, when Dr. David Kennedy of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government visits. He directed the Boston Gun Project, which sharply reduced the youth homicide rate in that city. Jeff Edmondson of Strive Together, the national group that works to improve the cradle-to-career pipeline, will visit on April 9.
</p><p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay’s role as a community resource, providing forums for thoughtful and provocative discussions that can impact thought and action on issues important to our community.
