</p><p>&#42;<strong>Smoothies pedaled at event are just tip of iceberg</strong>&#42;
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay will hold a teach&#45;in on Feb. 25, designed to move the debate on climate change from talk to action. This year's event looks at issues and solutions of local relevance in addressing the issue.
</p><p>Activities are scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue. All are free and open to the public. Visitors may stay for the whole program, or attend only those presentations that interest them. <a href="https://csumb.edu/site/x24941.xml">For a complete schedule, click here.</a> Displays will also be set up, and a complimentary lunch will be available. Parking is free.
</p><p>A range of topics will be presented by faculty, staff and community members between 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., highlighted by former Assemblyman John Laird speaking on "Green Jobs as Part of the Economic Recovery." Virginia  Johnson of Ecology Action and Kelly O'Brien of KUSP's Life in the Fastlane are also scheduled for the morning portion of the program.
</p><p>Jim Fowler will be on hand throughout the day to demonstrate his "fender blender," a bicycle&#45;powered blender he uses to make fruit smoothies. An attachment clips to the back of a bike, and when the rear wheel turns, it spins the blender mechanism – a creative way to conserve energy.
</p><p>A series of panel discussions will be held from 1 to 1:45 p.m. Most will be repeated from 2:15 to 3 p.m., allowing participants to attend two panels. They include:
