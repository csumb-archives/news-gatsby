  CSUMB is on the site of the former Fort Ord, and occasionally old training
  equipment is located and removed from areas adjacent to campus. In cooperation
  with the Monterey County Sheriffâ€™s Office and the local fire department, a
  device was safely destroyed at about 12:30 p.m. The area is now clear.
