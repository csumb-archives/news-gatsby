<p>While other students are returning to the classroom this fall, Wendy Holman is heading to Washington, D.C., where she will spend the semester working in the office of a member of the House of Representatives.
</p><p>The CSU Monterey Bay senior is one of 26 students taking part in this year’s <a href="http://www.panettainstitute.org/programs/study-with-us/congressional-intern-training/">Congressional Internship Program</a> through the Panetta Institute for Public Policy. All were selected based on exemplary academic achievement and interest in politics, policy and pubic service.
</p><p>A kinesiology major, Holman is interested in public health. “I applied for the internship because I am really interested in supporting federal legislation focusing on childhood obesity, since one of every three children is obese in our nation,” she said.
</p><p>“I would love to work with Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign, which tries to promote a healthier younger generation.”
</p><p>While in Washington, she hopes to see how bills originate and get through Congress, and to attend briefings and hearings on public health issues.
</p><p>Holman has been involved in student government at CSUMB, first as a director of community affairs – where she acted as the voice of students at Marina and Seaside city council meetings – and in the executive position of chief operations officer. She has served as an orientation leader and has represented her sorority on the Multicultural Greek Council.
</p><p>Prior to heading off to Capitol Hill on Aug. 23, Holman and the other students attendied an intensive two-week course at the Panetta Institute. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta taught sessions on Congressional leadership, committees and policymaking, and United State defense policies. Other classes covered key domestic and foreign policy issues; White House relations with Congress; House leadership and committee roles; and the role of the intern.
</p><p>While in Washington, the interns also attend regular seminars with government leaders on policy issues including economics, the environment, foreign affairs and defense resources.
</p><p>Students earn academic credit for the 13-week internship program. UPDATE: Holman was assigned to work in the office of Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, who represents the 46th District. The district covers parts of Orange County.
