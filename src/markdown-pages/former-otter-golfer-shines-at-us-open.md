</p><p>Erick Justesen, who played for CSU Monterey Bay's golf team in 2003, put his local knowledge to good use in Thursday's opening round of the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
</p><p>Justesen, who teed off in the last group, at 2:42 p.m., shot 35-39-74, five strokes behind the leaders. The former Otter was in good company, coming in with the same score as Tiger Woods and beating Phil Mickelson by a stroke.
</p><p>While a member of CSUMB's golf team, he played Pebble about once a semester. He also spent two summers as a caddie there.
</p><p>He graduated a two-time All-American at CSU Stanislaus in 2008, transferring from CSUMB after realizing that he wouldn't be eligible to play for the Division II national championship. At the time, CSUMB was in a probationary period after moving up to D-II.
</p><p>"I wasn't aware at the time that I went to CSUMB that we weren't going to be eligible for nationals," Justesen told the Monterey Herald. "Every golfer wants to compete at the top of wherever they are."
</p><p>He finished in the top 10 at the D-II national championship his junior year, then lost the title by one stroke during his senior year.
</p><p>The Sacramento native is currently competing on the Canadian Tour and occasionally plays in a Nationwide Tour event.
</p><p>To qualify for the Open, Justesen fired a 36-hole total of 9-under 133 (65-68) to earn one of four spots in a sectional qualifier held at Del Paso Country Club in Sacramento. He started his qualifying odyssey at a regional qualifier at Bayonet Golf Course, where he took medalist honors with an even-par 72.
</p><p>He teed off today at 9:12 a.m. from the first hole. He's playing with Jerry Smith and amateur Hudson Swafford.
