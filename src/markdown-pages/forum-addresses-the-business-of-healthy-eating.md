<h3>Greater Vision forum looks at public health and agriculture</h3><p>The “Greater Vision” series of public forums on topics important to local agriculture and the larger community continues Oct. 22 at California State University, Monterey Bay. The topic is “The Business of Healthy Eating.”
</p><p>Central Coast agriculture grows fruits and vegetables recommended for a healthy diet. The agriculture industry and public health are working together to protect the environment and prevent diseases such as diabetes. A public&#45;private partnership, uneasy at times, is emerging to address this challenge.
</p><p>This series will address how the systems of production agriculture and the promotion of public health can work together to provide value&#45;added produce at an affordable price while protecting farm workers and the environment. In three annual sessions, experts will examine this challenge and how it can be addressed through public policy, marketing programs designed to promote the public good, and new production technologies
</p><p>Congressman Sam Farr will deliver the keynote address, “Healthy, Hunger&#45;Free Kids Act of 2010.” A panel discussion will follow; panelists include CSUMB professors Brad Barbeau and Trish Sevene; Dr. Lorelei DiSogra of the United Fresh Produce Association; Dr. Edward Moreno, director of public health for Monterey County; and Gina Nucci of Mann Packing.
</p><p>The event will be held in the University Center on Sixth Avenue and B Street, starting at 2 p.m. The event is free; however, a parking permit must be purchased from the machine on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map can be downloaded <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
