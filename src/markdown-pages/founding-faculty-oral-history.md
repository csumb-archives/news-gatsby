<h2>
  Project provides historical record of memories, experiences during CSUMB's
  early years
</h2>
<p>
  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., June 5, 2020</b> - Honoring our 25th anniversary, the
  university has completed the “<a
    href="https://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/founding-faculty-project/"
    >CSUMB Founding Faculty Oral History Project: 1995-1998</a
  >,” its first sponsored institutional oral history project. The project
  includes interviews with 33 retired and current faculty members and
  photographs taken during those formative years. Interviews and supporting
  materials are accessible through the
  <a href="https://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/">Digital Commons @ CSUMB.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The project “aims to create and preserve a historical record, giving voice to
  the diverse perspectives, memories, struggles and achievements of the faculty,
  as it worked collaboratively and sometimes contentiously, crossing
  disciplinary and other divides, to build the academic heart and soul of the
  university,” according to its introduction page.
</p>
<p>
  All academic areas are represented — arts, humanities, science, social
  sciences, education, business, technology, social work and service learning —
  at all levels, including lecturers who later became full professors and deans.
</p>
<p>
  Project director Rina Benmayor said participants hope future resources will
  enable the project to continue and include a greater number of faculty and
  their experiences in subsequent years. The offices of the President, Provost,
  and the Dean of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, as well as the Tanimura
  &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library team, provided funding and support for the
  project.
</p>
<p>
  The original recordings, hard copy transcripts and other descriptive materials
  will be archived in the CSUMB Oral History and Community Memory Archive,
  within
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/library/archives-special-collections"
    >Archives and Special Collections</a
  >
  in the library. Interviews were conducted by an "insider" team of founding
  faculty, Benmayor said. The interviews run from 40 to 90 minutes each. All
  were audio-recorded, either face-to-face or via videoconferencing.
</p>
<p>
  Interviews were professionally transcribed and lightly edited for clarity and
  readability. In keeping with professional oral history practices, narrators
  reviewed and revised their transcripts, signed release forms, and indicated
  how they wished their interview to be used or restricted. Restricted material
  is not publicly available.
