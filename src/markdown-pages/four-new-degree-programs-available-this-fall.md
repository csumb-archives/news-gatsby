<h3>Nursing scheduled to be added next summer</h3><p>Interested in a career in the Foreign Service, international business, education, or translation and interpretation? Do you want to be prepared to travel the world? Do you want to be able to communicate with peoples of other cultures?
</p><p>The School of World Languages and Cultures at CSU Monterey Bay now offers degree programs in Japanese and Spanish to help students accomplish those goals.
</p><p>The Bachelor of Arts in Japanese Language and Culture prepares students to be active participants in an increasingly interdependent world by developing literacy in global matters, multiculturalism and cultural diversity. Students come away with an impressive level of language proficiency, able to communicate effectively in Japanese with cultural knowledge in history, literature and social sciences.
</p><p>Students in the new Bachelor of Arts in Spanish attain an advanced level of proficiency in Spanish. They also acquire a reasonable understanding and knowledge of Hispanic cultures through the study of literature, history, art, social science and philosophy through courses taught in Spanish and English.

</p><p>Also new this fall are two majors in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy. A Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Science is now available, elevating what had been a concentration to the level of a full major. And students can now choose to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies. The program has a significant social science and humanities component – class options come from Social, Behavioral and Global Studies; Humanities and Communication; Liberal Studies; Kinesiology; Teledramatic Arts and Technology; and Collaborative Health and Human Services in addition to math and the sciences.

</p><p>The next undergraduate degree to be offered is nursing. Pending approval from the regional accrediting body, the program will be available in summer 2012.?
</p><p>CSUMB is collaborating with established nursing programs at the four community colleges in the area – Monterey Peninsula, Hartnell, Cabrillo and Gavilan – in a unique way that avoids duplication of effort and waste of resources.??
</p><p>Students will begin the program at one of the community colleges, spend several years in “blended” learning when they take classes at their community college and the university, and then finish their studies at CSUMB.
