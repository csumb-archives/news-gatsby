<p>When Mateo Sixtos drives to his computer science classes every weekday, he takes a good, hard look at the strawberry fields he first worked hen he was only 10 years old. . . . Today, he's enrolled in a new, rigorous and academically daring college program – a collaboration between CSU Monterey Bay and Hartnell Community College – that promises to help students from the agricultural Salinas Valley earn a bachelor's degree in computer science in only three years. – <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, Dec. 3, 2013
