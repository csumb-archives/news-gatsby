<p><em>Sincerely, 2012</em>, a show by students in the Visual and Public Art Department, is on display in the Balfour/Brutzman Gallery on campus.
</p><p>The show explores apocalyptic beliefs that have proven remarkably resilient over time.
</p><p>The year 2012 is considered a pivotal date in human history. The media suggests that our way of life may be ending, the result of global warming, financial ruin and spreading plagues.
</p><p>The exhibit was organized by a committee that invited students to submit works in any medium.
</p><p>The works represent the artists’ exploration of apocalyptic beliefs and the end of time – system failure, faith, expectations, and psychological or emotional needs.
</p><p>The gallery is located in the Visual and Public Art-East building. Hours are Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Friday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The show will remain on display through April 20.
</p><p>Featured artists include Xavier Bellante, Dillion West Costello, Stephanie Edwards, Bryan Lenorud, Laura Jane Oneto, Victor Rivas, Kelly Thomas, Anita Velasco and Stephanie Sumler.
