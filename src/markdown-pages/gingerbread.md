<p>Really serious.
</p><p>Serious enough to buy and construct a 3-D puzzle of the cathedral. "Then, we went online and found the floor plan," said Lianne Minemoto. "We knew where all the domes were located."
</p><p>The cathedral was in keeping with the contest theme of "It's a Small World - Campus Edition."
</p><p>Some of the other structures featured shredded wheat and potato chip roofs, melted Lifesaver ponds and marshmallow cream mortar.
</p><p>And most of the gingerbread creations weren't mere houses. There was the ocean scene, featuring a research vessel from the university's Seafloor Mapping Lab around the theme "Mapping the World for Conservation"; an Egyptian holiday scene including a pyramid and camels; the North Pole, with a plea to "Stop Global Warming"; a pagoda made with seaweed and chocolate; an adobe structure; and "Frohe Weihnachten" a replica of a traditional German Christmas decoration.
</p><p>The competition demonstrated that you don't have to be a pastry chef to build a great gingerbread house.
