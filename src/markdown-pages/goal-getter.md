<h4>CSUMB student spends semester in Washington, D.C.</h4><p>Jillian Shweiki wants to get involved in national politics as a campaign manager or political adviser. That’s after she finishes law school.
</p><p>The senior global studies major is getting a head start on her career aspirations as she takes part in the Congressional Internship Program hosted by the Panetta Institute.
</p><p>California State University campuses choose one student each year to participate in the program. Each intern is selected based on an exemplary academic record as well as an interest in politics and service. Shweiki is this year’s representative from CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>After two weeks of orientation at the Panetta Institute – located on the CSUMB campus – the interns traveled to Washington, D.C., where they spend the fall semester working in the office of a member of Congress from California.
</p><p>The orientation provided classes on the legislative and administrative structures of a Congressional office, key national issues, House leadership and committee roles, rules and procedures of debate and lawmaking, budget and appropriations processes, White House relations with Congress and the role of the press. Experts and former elected officials spoke with the interns and provided them with a strong foundation for their work in Washington.
</p><p>“I’m hoping to learn what the legislative process is like on a day-to-day basis, to see what really keeps our country running,” Shweiki said a few days into her training at the Panetta Institute.
</p><p>While in D.C., the interns attend regular seminars with government leaders on various aspects of policy, including economics, the environment, foreign affairs and defense resources.
</p><p>“I can’t wait to attend the lectures the institute hosts for us in D.C.,” she said. “I’m also looking forward to getting to know my fellow interns better.
</p><p>“It’s only been a few days, and we’re already a 23-person family.”
</p><p>She didn't have a preference for which member of Congress she was assigned to. “I'm hoping it will be one who focuses on issues that I’m passionate about – women’s issues, higher education and foreign policy.”
</p><p>Costs for the program, including travel, housing and a small stipend, are covered by the Panetta Institute with support from its board of directors, the CSU Chancellor and other donors.
</p><p>Shweiki, 22, will earn 20 academic credits for the semester. She’s on schedule to graduate in May, and hopes to attend law school next fall.
</p><p>But her immediate goal is to take full advantage of the opportunity before her.
</p><p>“This will be one of the most incredible and rewarding learning experiences of my life,” she said. To learn more about the Panetta Institute’s Congressional Internship Program, click <a href="http://www.panettainstitute.org/programs/study-with-us/congressional-intern-training/">here</a>.
