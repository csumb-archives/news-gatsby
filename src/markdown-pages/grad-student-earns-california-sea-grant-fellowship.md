  Sean Windell, a student in the applied marine and watershed science master’s
  degree program, has been named one of 17 California Sea Grant Fellows for
  2015.

<p>
  The
  <a

    >Sea Grant College program</a
  >
  is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
  &#40;NOAA&#41;, and provides graduate students the opportunity to obtain
  experience in the planning and implementation of marine and coastal resource
  policies. Fellows are matched with a host agency and gain on&#45;the&#45;job
  experience during the 12&#45;month paid fellowship.

  Windell has already started working with the Interagency Ecological Program, a
  collaboration among nine agencies that does long&#45;term monitoring in the
  Sacramento&#45;San Joaquin Delta. His project involves designing a conceptual
  life&#45;cycle model for the winter run Chinook salmon, an endangered species.

  Windell graduates from CSUMB this spring. For his thesis, he studied the value
  of habitat diversity in marine reserves, specifically the spiny lobster use of
  the intertidal zone at the Santa Catalina marine protected area. He worked in
  Dr. Corey Garza’s Marine Landscape Ecology Lab.
</p>
<p>
  He earned an undergraduate degree at UC Santa Barbara, and then moved to Santa
  Cruz to work for the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal
  Oceans &#40;PISCO&#41;. “I liked it so much that I wanted to go to grad school
  in the Monterey Bay area,” he said, and that led him to CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  He’s not sure what he’ll do after the fellowship ends. “Either job
  opportunities within this or other agencies, or hiking the Pacific Crest
  Trail,” he said.
