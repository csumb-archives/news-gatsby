<p>When Scott Toews completes his master’s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy this semester, he won’t have to worry about finding a job.
</p><p>He’s already got one lined up, although he doesn’t yet know what he will be doing or where he will be living.
</p><p>Toews has been selected as a California Sea Grant Fellow, a highly competitive fellowship for graduate students interested in marine resources and the policy decisions affecting those resources.
</p><p>A dozen agencies serve as hosts for the fellows, who spend a year in a paid position with one of them.
</p><p>He and the other fellows will travel to Sacramento on Nov. 8, where they will be matched with agencies. His assignment will start in January.
</p><p>“I have several preferences – the Ocean Protection Council, Ocean Science Trust or the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary,” he said.
</p><p>The native of Winkler, Manitoba, Canada, has been working in Dr. Corey Garza’s Marine Landscape Ecology Lab at CSUMB.
</p><p>Before coming to California, he earned a bachelor of science in biology and environmental studies at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.
</p><p>“I became aware of CSUMB through Dr. Garza, as we had worked together off and on in British Columbia when he was a post doc for a CSU Los Angeles researcher,” Toews said.
</p><p>“When Corey came here, he asked if I was interested in working with him and the CWSP program.”
</p><p>Since he was interested in a program that integrated policy and science, what CSUMB had to offer “synched well with what I was looking for.”
</p><p>The program’s strong technological focus also appealed to him. “It let me expand my skill set and has challenged me,” he said.
</p><p>Between lining up his agency placement and starting to work, he’ll defend his thesis. It links marine habitat complexity and composition to genetic structuring in populations of black surfperch.
</p><p>“More simply – it attempts to describe the role that habitat plays in the health of this species. The thesis is multidisciplinary, using population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial techniques,” he said.
</p><p>Once the academic work is out of the way, he’ll have to move, most likely to Sacramento, Oakland or Santa Barbara, while he spends his year as a fellow.
</p><p>Then, he’ll probably have a number of options.
</p><p>“An appointment as a California Sea Grant Fellow is a highly desirable position that can lead to a number of significant career opportunities,” Dr. Garza said.
