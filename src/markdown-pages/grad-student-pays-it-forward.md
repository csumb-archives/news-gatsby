<h3>UROC propels Liz Lopez to master's program at USD</h3><p>Liz Lopez, a 2013 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay, has fit right in at the University of San Diego, where she is pursuing a master’s degree in marine science.
</p><p>Last spring, Lopez, Michael Diaz and Emily Roncase received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships. Each was awarded $90,000 over three years.
</p><p>For outstanding students in the sciences, the fellowships are a golden ticket. The CSUMB students were among approximately 2,000 winners from a pool of more than 13,000 applicants nationwide.
</p><p>Lopez credits the help she received through CSUMB’s <a href="http://csumb.edu/uroc">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a> with some of her success.
</p><p>“It catapulted me,” she told <em>Inside USD</em>, a university publication. “It gave me the skills I needed to look for my own opportunities, gave me a network and the chance to attend conferences. If I hadn’t been in the program, I wouldn’t have known to come here to USD,” she added.
</p><p>At San Diego, she is pursuing research that involves looking at the connection between land and sea.
</p><p>“I’ve never done terrestrial work before . . .but I look forward to having an experience on land and being hands-on, even more so than anything I’ve done in the water,” she told <em>Inside USD</em>. She’ll be working in Bahia de Los Angeles in Baja California, an area that gives researchers opportunities with various terrains in one large space.
</p><p>She’ll also work with high school students from San Diego’s City Heights, a diverse group of students who have developed a passion for science through the Ocean Discovery Institute.
</p><p>And she’s lending a hand to the McNair Scholars program and a chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).
</p><p>“Being a good scientist is important,” she told <em>Inside USD</em>, “but being a good mentor is one of the reasons why I came here.”
</p><p>And that’s something she learned through UROC, where her mentors were CSUMB Professor James Lindholm, and Professor Sarah Henkel at Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center.
