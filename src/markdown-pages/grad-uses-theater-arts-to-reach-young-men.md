<p>Gilbert Salazar was born to work with young people. He has spent years teaching, guiding and mentoring them in a variety of settings.
</p><p>Now the former Service Learning Student Leader and 2008 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay’s integrated studies special major is headed to the University of Southern California to pursue a Master of Arts degree in applied theater arts. The program appeals to him because he believes theater can be used to address social issues.
</p><p>Since graduating, Salazar has worked with at-risk youth at Sunrise House in Salinas in a program called Youth Alternatives to Violence; as a youth coordinator for the United Way; and at the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center, where he teaches MyStrengh classes.
</p><p>MyStrength is a statewide program that targets young men between the ages of 14 and 18, empowering them to speak out against sexual violence.
</p><p>Through his work with the Rape Crisis Center, he also visits middle and high schools, teaching about sexual harassment and assault in order to prevent sexual violence.
</p><p>Skits and role-playing figure in his work, and he’s eager to learn how to better develop and facilitate those activities.
</p><p>“It’s my intent with the applied theater arts program to move males away from harmful behaviors and activities and toward masculine identities that are less harmful, less violent,” he said.
</p><p>He sees it as a continuation of the work he did for his capstone project at CSUMB, where he developed a curriculum to prevent adolescent male violence.
</p><p>“I want to move forward with a curriculum to be included in the burgeoning fields of masculinity studies and gender studies,” he said.
</p><p>“Last year, my work was recognized. I was interviewed by USC sociology professor Michael Messner for an anthology about men who work in the violence prevention movement.”
</p><p>He’s quick to point out that applied theater arts is not about staging a production; it’s about education and creating change.
</p><p>And that’s a challenge he’s eager to embrace.
