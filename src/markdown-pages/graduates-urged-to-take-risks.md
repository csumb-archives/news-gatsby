<p>The future of 1,022 students who received college degrees from CSU Monterey Bay can be a glowing one if they move forward with optimism and without fear of risk. That was the message delivered to fellow students and a crowd of about 8,000 spectators at Freeman Stadium by student Scott Bell, a campus leader whose own future will include graduate studies in psychology at Sonoma State. â€“ Monterey Herald, May 21, 2011
