<p>For the 11 students who spent the summer conducting research through the Ocean Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates program based at CSU Monterey Bay, Aug. 14 was graduation day.
</p><p>The students – including two from CSUMB and two from local community colleges – presented their work to a group of their peers, faculty and administrators, and mentors from the collaborating agencies at the Summer Research Symposium.
</p><p>“Today’s event represents our commitment to undergraduate research,” said Dr. Marsha Moroh, dean of the College of Science. “Other campuses in the California State University system are looking to CSUMB as a model of how to do it,” she said.

Dr. Corey Garza, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the program, referred to it as a distributed REU model. “Within 14 miles, students can choose to work at five research institutions as well as CSUMB,” he said.
</p><p>Those institutions are Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve; Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University; Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute; Moss Landing Marine Labs; and the Naval Postgraduate School.
</p><p>Among the student research topics presented:
</p><p>In addition to presentations by the REU students, about 40 students from CSUMB’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center presented posters highlighting the work they did over the summer.
</p><p>The research symposium was the first event held in the university’s newly opened Business and Information Technology Building. “We’re calling this the shakedown cruise,” Dr. Moroh said.
