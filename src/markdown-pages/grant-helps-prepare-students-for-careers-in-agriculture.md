</p><p>A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will help CSU Monterey Bay prepare students for careers in natural resources and agriculture.
</p><p>The university will use the $300,000 to enhance its curriculum by adding courses in plant and soil science â€“ classes that are essential for careers with agencies that manage natural resources important to agriculture.
</p><p>The new courses will enable CSUMB students to qualify for jobs in a range of fields within the USDA and other resource agencies, positions the agriculture department considers mission critical.
</p><p>The grant will also expand the university's commitment to undergraduate research by providing 24 paid internships, linking students to a professional network and connecting them to careers in the region. A scholarship for a student in the Master's of Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy program at CSUMB will also be funded by the grant.
</p><p>"This grant gives us the opportunity to bolster the development of our students - in the classroom and in the field - to prepare them for careers in natural resources in support of agriculture and related fields," said Marc Los Huertos, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy.
</p><p>Dr. Los Huertos has formed a community advisory group to provide industry perspectives and help the university align its curriculum with workforce needs of the region's agricultural industry.
