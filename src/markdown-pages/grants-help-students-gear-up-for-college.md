<p>Middle school students in Monterey County will be better equipped for college thanks to federal grants awarded to Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The money will allow 3,620 students to be served in San Ardo, San Lucas, Greenfield, King City, Salinas and Seaside.
</p><p>The grants, which amount to $2.1 million per year for six years, with another $1.4 million in year seven, were awarded under the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs – GEAR UP – administered by the U.S Department of Education.
</p><p>GEAR UP aims to increase the proportion of students from low-income areas who are prepared for college. It provides academic and financial aid advising, tutoring, college field trips and other activities that help students prepare for and apply to college.

</p><p>While CSUMB offers a variety of early outreach and support programs for underserved students, this is the first GEAR UP grant for the university.
