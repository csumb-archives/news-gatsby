<p>California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater will present a tribute to the greatest hits of the 1950s and ’60s when The Alley Cats perform on Oct. 20.
</p><p>Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>By bringing their own contemporary style to tunes from that era, The Alley Cats appeal to fans of all ages, breathing new life into everyone's favorite doo-wop classics.
</p><p>For the uninitiated, doo-wop is an ebullient, rhythm and blues-fueled harmony vocal style where one person sings lead and the others harmonize or mimic the sounds of instruments behind them. It rose to prominence in the 1950s. The first real boy bands, before N’Sync and the Backstreet Boys, were doo-wop groups like the Del Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts, and in the Motown era, The Temptations, Four Tops and Miracles.
</p><p>The four members of The Alley Cats are a perfect blend both vocally and personally. Every Alley Cat performance is accompanied by the sounds of laughter and voices joining in to sing the melodies we all know and love.
</p><p>The Cats' engaging wit and humor have won over audiences nationally as they relate directly to the crowd with jokes, stories and audience participation that appeals to young and old alike. Tight harmonies, universal humor, and unbelievable a cappella energy have made The Alley Cats America's premier doo-wop group.
</p><p>The group has performed with Jay Leno, the Beach Boys and at the White House.
</p><p>Tickets are $40 premium, $29 general. Discounts are available for students and seniors. Tickets can be purchased online at csumb.edu/worldtheater or by calling the box office at 582-4580.
