<p>Two CSUMB students were behind the free soccer program run out of the Cesar Chavez Library in Salinas. "They are athletes who used soccer as their pathway to higher education. Each recognizes the value of athletics as an opportunity to gain admittance to a university," said library technology manager Carissa Purnell. "Originally they came to complete their community service hours, but fell in love with the students, their families and the community. They took the initiative to apply for grant funding." â€“ <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, July 20, 2013
