  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., May 22, 2020 </b>- CSUMB’s
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/guardianscholars">Guardian Scholars</a> program for
  current and former foster youth had a record-breaking 21 students graduate
  from the university this academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Keyiona Ritchey, the program’s retention advisor, called it a “huge
  accomplishment for our students,” particularly in light of national
  statistics: only 10% of foster youth enter college and just 3% graduate.
</p>
<p>
  “Our students are resilient. They have persevered and overcome so much in
  their life, and they have used those same skills to navigate and successfully
  complete college. They believed they could do it and didn't give up,” Ritchey
  said.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB had 38 students in Guardian Scholars this semester. Last year the
  program had 42 participants with only eight graduates. Ritchey said she
  believes the difference in the number of graduates occurred largely because
  most participants happened to complete their graduation requirements this
  year, but increased support and services from the program also played an
  important part.
</p>
<p>
  Guardian Scholars added its first peer mentor intern last academic year, and
  started a laptop loan program this year. They collaborated with Hartnell
  College on two events this semester to help establish communication and build
  a better pipeline for transfer students. The program also held three faculty
  and staff mentor trainings and welcomed eight new mentors to help support
  participants.
</p>
<p>
  “Often my students tell me they feel invisible on campus, because you can't
  look at someone and tell they have been in the foster care system or
  experienced homelessness, so their issues, needs, and success get overlooked,”
  Ritchey said.
</p>
<p>
  Guardian Scholars has created positive change by providing a community-based
  support system.
</p>
<p>
  “Knowing that they have a sub-community on campus where they can trust and
  build rapport with the retention advisor, have access to the different
  services the program provides, and meet other students who come from similar
  backgrounds has assisted in persistence and retention,” Ritchey said.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to COVID-19, participants in a focus group shared that the program gave
  them an environment where they “had an inherent understanding of the weight of
  each other’s experiences,” said intern Jaquelyn Martinez, who facilitated the
  group.
</p>
<p>
  “It was an opportunity to rejoice in their resilience, strength and power,
  instead of having to revisit past trauma to connect."
