<p>. . . While Gov. Jerry Brown and the legislature wielded chainsaws to education, CSUMB President Dianne Harrison and her team stood atop a sand dune and looked ahead at the future of the university. . . Her "being smart and staying nimble" attitude ushered in several new degree programs, landed CSUMB the honor of hosting the statewide CSU Summer Arts program and supported its golf team as it captured the university's first NCAA title. â€“ The Salinas Californian, Aug. 19, 2011
