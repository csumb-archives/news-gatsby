  SEASIDE, Calif., August 23, 2018 – Hartnell College and California State
  University, Monterey Bay’s (CSUMB) joint
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/liberalstudies/teacher-pathway-program"
    >Teacher Pathway Program</a
  >
  has received a $335,000 grant from The Claire Giannini Fund that will help
  ensure the program’s continued growth and success. With the support of the
  Claire Giannini Fund, Hartnell College and CSUMB have built the Teacher
  Pathway Program with an eye towards sustainability; ensuring this project
  continues to prepare fully qualified elementary and special education teachers
  to all of Monterey County communities well into the future.
</p>
<p>
  The first cohort of the program, which began fall of 2016 and is now entering
  its third year, achieved an 86% graduation rate earning their Associates
  Degree for Transfer (AA-T) in two years, a much higher graduation rate than
  students enrolled in a traditional program. The first cohort of the program is
  now working to earn their bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies and teaching
  credential at CSUMB.

  “The Teacher Pathway Program is our collaborative "grow-our-own" solution to
  addressing the regional teacher shortage,” said CSUMB College of Education
  Dean Jose Luis Alvarado. “The program has achieved incredible success, as
  evidenced by high retention rates and a high graduation rate at the AA level
  for the first cohort. Additionally, the structured pathway reduces the
  time-to-transfer, while developing a strong teacher workforce that taps into
  local talent to improve the college readiness of youth in our communities."
</p>
<p>
  This unique partnership, along with the streamlined program design, reduces
  the time it takes to transfer, thereby reducing costs to the participants. The
  continued success of Teacher Pathway Program has resulted in increased
  enrollment each year and expansion to new locations.
</p>
<p>
  "Due to the success and popularity of this program, it has expanded into new
  locations and grown in numbers by 80%, from 28 students in cohort #1 to 38
  students in cohort #2 in South Monterey County. The growth continues with 42
  students in the third cohort in Salinas," said Hartnell College
  Superintendent/President Dr. Willard Lewallen. "We are incredibly proud of
  this program and its positive impact on not only the students, but the
  community at-large."
</p>

  The Claire Giannini Fund, an independent foundation, has provided seed funding
  for the Teacher Pathway. Trustee Betsy Buchalter Adler noted that the Fund,
  which will sunset at the end of 2020, views the Teacher Pathway as one of its
  best investments. “Our founder dedicated the Fund to the education and welfare
  of young people 18 and under. I am confident that she would be glad to know
  that her legacy has helped to educate the next generation of Monterey County’s
  students by helping Hartnell College and CSUMB to educate their teachers.”
  Adler added that she is particularly impressed by the collaboration between
  CSUMB and Hartnell. "These two institutions have worked together to use their
  resources productively, avoiding duplication and enhancing each other's
  strengths. I hope community colleges and universities elsewhere in California
  will adopt this model."
