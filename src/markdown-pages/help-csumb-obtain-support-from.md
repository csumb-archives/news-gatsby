</p><p>CSUMB, listed as No. 16 on the list of organizations, seeks your help and participation in support of its environmental sustainability initiatives. The university seeks $50,000 to hire a new sustainability officer to further develop and oversee a Climate Action Plan. Duties would include coordinating student, staff and faculty participation, integrating sustainability into the curriculum, establishing a baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory, establishing targets for reduction, developing and implementing a plan to reduce emissions and measuring the results.
</p><p>Sustainability is a core value for CSUMB. In 2007, President Dianne Harrison was one of the original signers of the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment that pledged the university to a path of climate neutrality.
</p><p>"Global warming is a defining challenge of our time," Dr. Harrison said at the time.
</p><p>"Human activities are responsible for the problem, and working together humans have the capacity to solve the problem," she said. "That means taking serious action to stop adding global warming pollution to the atmosphere.
</p><p>"CSUMB is committed to leading the way."
