<p>Once again, CSUMB’s Return of the Natives restoration education project has been selected to participate in the Monterey County Weekly’s annual fund-raising campaign. Monterey County Gives selects dozens of local non-profit organizations each year to highlight, asking readers to support their favorites. Last year, the program raised more than $529,000 from readers, and an additional $100,000 of matching funds. Extra funding will go to the organization with the most donors and the one with the most donors under age 35. The drive runs from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, and includes 95 nonprofits.
</p><p>Donations can be made online at <a href="//www.mcgives.com">www.mcgives.com</a>. The website offers profiles of all participating agencies and shows a running tally of donations received. The newspaper highlights Return of the Natives’ new project for 2012 – habitat-restoration programs in Seaside. The program, Seaside Parks Go Native, will partner with Sustainable Seaside and neighborhood park associations to create native habitat gardens in five Seaside parks.
