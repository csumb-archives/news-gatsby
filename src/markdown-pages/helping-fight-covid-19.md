<h2>Science students working in labs have huge impact on testing efforts</h2>
<p><b>By Sophia Huang McKenzie</b></p>
<p><i>Published May 15, 2020</i></p>
<p>
  Early on in the global pandemic, CSU Monterey Bay student Angela Albanese
  learned the alarming news about the heavy toll the coronavirus was taking in
  her home country of Italy. The epicenter of Europe’s outbreak, Italy logged
  the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world in March.
</p>
<p>
  <b>“</b>What COVID-19 caused back home scared me, but also pushed me to take
  action,” Albanese said. “When I heard that the Monterey County Health
  Department needed extra help with the COVID-19 testing, I immediately made my
  time and lab skills available to the community.”
</p>
<p>
  Albanese, a biology major in the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/science/">College of Science</a>, is one of several
  area science students who volunteered to work at the lab when a call went out
  for help. The lab previously had only three employees to conduct testing, and
  no funds to hire more.
</p>
<p>
  The student volunteers enabled COVID-19 testing capacity to increase
  dramatically by seven times in just five weeks, the lab told CSUMB’s KAZU
  radio station in April. The lab extended its hours and testing numbers went up
  from about 20 specimens a day to a record number of 150. Patients in Monterey
  and San Benito counties were then able to receive test results within a day or
  two, instead of having to wait longer.
</p>
<p>
  “I am truly honored to contribute to the effort the world is making to fight
  this pandemic,” Albanese said.
</p>
<p>
  A CSUMB graduate student in marine biology, Melissa Naugle also volunteers at
  the county lab. Naugle normally conducts research at the Marine Ecological
  Physiology Lab.
</p>
<p>
  She studies coral bleaching, which occurs when corals are stressed by changes
  in conditions such as temperature, light or nutrients, according to the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The corals turn completely
  white and become in danger of dying. Naugle’s lab experience proved valuable.
</p>
<p>
  “Since the lab protocols are really similar to my lab research at CSUMB, I was
  already familiar with much of the lab work,” she said.
</p>
<p>
  Working in a different type of lab environment has “added breadth” to her
  education. “It has also been super fulfilling to volunteer my time to a cause
  that is directly benefiting people in my community,” Naugle said.
</p>
<p>
  The county employs a third CSUMB science student, Pilar Rentar, as a
  laboratory assistant. Rentar is enrolled in a biochemistry class as a
  post-baccalaureate student preparing for graduate school.

<p>
  CSUMB biology major Kaylee Wehunt assists with COVID-19 antibody testing at
  ARCPoint Labs, a private diagnostic testing laboratory in Monterey. The
  antibody test “identifies who has had the virus and who may still be fighting
  it off,” she explained.
</p>
<p>
  Working at the lab, “I am applying the knowledge I have gained from my
  immunology course this semester to benefit my community,” Wehunt said.
</p>
<p>
  A certified phlebotomist — someone trained to draw blood from a patient for
  clinical or medical testing, transfusions, donations, or research — Wehunt had
  just started working at the lab when the pandemic started.
</p>
<p>
  <b>“</b>This is my first experience in this type of lab setting, as well as
  the first time I am able to put my licensure to use in an official capacity.
  While nervous, I was hopeful to begin making a difference in the community by
  offering much-needed testing as soon as possible,” Wehunt said.
</p>
<p>
  “Being able to work in the lab is an opportunity I will forever be grateful
  for. I am able to practice phlebotomy while also helping make a difference
  during this pandemic.”<b></b>
