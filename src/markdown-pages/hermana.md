<h4>Hermana helps county students attend CSUMB</h4><p>On Tuesday, Nov. 15 - National Philanthropy Day - 'Hermana' will be honored at a luncheon at the Inn at Spanish Bay as the Outstanding Service Organization on the Central Coast.
</p><p>Frustrated by watching talented local students fail to complete college because of a lack of money, a group of businesswomen joined together in 2002 to create 'Hermana' (Sister), an organization that raises scholarship funds to assist CSUMB students from the local area.
</p><p>The organization awards five to 10 scholarships per year in the range of $500 to $1,000 each. Recently, Hermana made a $20,000 gift to the university for an endowed scholarship that will provide support to a local student every year in perpetuity. The women of Hermana make donations themselves to the fund and fund-raise from the broader community as well.
</p><p>Scholarships are awarded to Monterey County students who have overcome significant obstacles, including language barriers and family and work obligations, in order to attend college.
</p><p>Hermana also sponsors activities with local young women and girls, including a much-needed mentoring program called "hermanita" (little sister). Recently, Hermana held a dinner and invited several students (high school and college) who were having difficulty in school or lacked family support for their educational goals. As a result, these students now have mentors and many of the parents of these students have become supportive of their daughter's college aspirations.
