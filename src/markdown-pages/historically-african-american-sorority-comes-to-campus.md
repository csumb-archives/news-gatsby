<p>For more than a century, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority has been committed to public service, with a primary focus on the black community. Now, there is a chapter at CSU Monterey Bay, the first historically African American sorority established on campus. The Upsilon Xi chapter was chartered in April with seven members: Diamond Gaskins, Shiyla Goodie, Nancy Her, Brigette Johnson, Tyler Posey, Courtney Thomas and Tiffany Williams.
</p><p>The chapter plans service projects for the fall that focus on physical and mental health issues that include all students, specifically geared toward under-represented women.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the largest black Greek organization in the country. More than a thousand chapters have initiated 200,000 members. It was founded in 1913 at Howard University to promote academic excellence and provide assistance to those in need.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the eighth sorority to be chartered at CSUMB; six fraternities are also active. (A complete list can be found <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/multicultural-greek-council-0">here</a>.)
</p><p>"We are grateful for CSUMB's enthusiastic support for a collegiate chapter. Upsilon Xi will extend Delta's legacy of scholarship, service and sisterhood to the campus community, while connecting members committed to public service," said Brenda Grayson Shinault, the chapter's primary adviser and a member of the sororityâ€™s Monterey Peninsula alumnae chapter.
