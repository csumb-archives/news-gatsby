<p>
  The holiday season and dawn of a new year is a time for reflection and
  gratitude. Now is an opportunity to celebrate the successes of our students,
  the advancement of knowledge and commitment to teaching by our faculty, and
  the dedication of our staff.
</p>
<p>
  The December break also marks the halfway point for our silver jubilee
  celebration.
</p>
<p>
  In the fall, we honored our past. We celebrated our founding faculty and staff
  who established an institution that lives our Founding Vision of inclusion,
  service-learning and as stewards of place - providing service to our region,
  state, country and world.
</p>
<p>
  In the new year, we will transition our 25th Anniversary focus to serving the
  future, discussing our charted course for expanding our reach, engaging
  further with our community, and building on our commitment to underserved
  populations in California.
</p>
<p>
  I wish our students, faculty, staff and all Otters around the country and the
  world joy this holiday season and a happy new year.
</p>
<p><b>Eduardo M. Ochoa</b>, President CSU, Monterey Bay</p>
