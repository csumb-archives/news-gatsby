<p>SEASIDE, Calif., March 24, 2017 – The Veterans Resource Center at CSUMB has a new refurbished space for student veterans to gather thanks to a generous donation of $6,000 by The Home Depot Foundation (THDF).</p><p>The renovations, which include new carpeting and furnishings, were received from THDF in partnership with the Student Veterans of America &#40;SVA&#41;.
</p><p>"The Veteran students on campus finally have a fully furnished space on campus where they can study, relax and connect with each other when not in class,” said CSUMB Veteran Services Coordinator Giselle Young. “Now that the room is warm and inviting, SVO club participation has increased and we now have the proper seating to accommodate everyone!”
</p><p>SVO president, business major and Army veteran Gilbert Bernabe says the <a href="https://csumb.edu/veterans">Veterans Resource Center</a> has become a home away from home for him and that he utilizes the center much more now than during his first semester. “That is all thanks to the work of Giselle, and the sponsors, for making the resource center feel as welcoming as it does now,” said Bernabe.
</p><p>The Home Depot Foundation and SVA teamed up in 2014 to launch the Vet Center Initiative, offering SVA chapters a chance to compete for up to $10,000 in grant money to build or renovate veteran centers.
</p><p>The new and improved veterans center offers an inviting atmosphere where veterans can seek assistance with benefits, gain access to support services designed for veterans and build social support networks to motivate each other to stay in college.
</p><p>"It is great for Veterans to have their own space to gather and work without having to roam around campus wondering where they can go between classes. Thanks to the support of Giselle and the sponsors we have that now,” said collaborative health and human service major and retired Marine Luis D. Salcedo.
</p><p>CSUMB plans to celebrate the remodeled space on April 7, 2017 with a ribbon cutting and open house to follow from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. All are welcome and encouraged to stop by to meet our CSUMB SVA leaders and view the new space.
</p><p>“We were very lucky to have received the generous financial support from The Home Depot Foundation, and nothing could match the great customer service received from our local Home Depot store in Salinas,” said Young.
