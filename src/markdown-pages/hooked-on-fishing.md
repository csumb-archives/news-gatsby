<h3>CSUMB anglers place third in Western Invitational</h3><p>Competitive bass fishing at the collegiate level – who knew?
</p><p>In 2008, FLW, the organizer of professional fishing tournaments, started a college tour. Now, more than 600 teams compete in five divisions, according to FLW’s website, and it just keeps growing. It’s even on television – NBC Sports has broadcast tournaments.
</p><p>Two teams from CSU Monterey Bay's Bass Fishing Club – Andrew Sjostrom and Joshua Smith, and Matthew Diaz and Sebastian Resendiz – competed in the Western Conference Invitational tournament Oct. 12 and 13 in Clear Lake. They were among 45 teams that competed for a top prize of $4,000 for their club and their school and a berth in next year’s FLW national championship.
</p><p>At the tournaments, the goal is simple: land 10 bass (five per day) over the two-day tournament that weigh more than the other teams. 
</p><p>Smith and Sjostrom took third place with a total of nine fish weighing 37 lbs., 2 oz. That was worth a $1,000 prize and a spot in next spring's national tournament.
</p><p>Diaz and Resendiz teamed for eighth place with fishing weighing 31 lbs., 9 oz. They also qualified for the national event.
</p><p>CSUMB’s club started several years ago. Members travel to tournaments in California and other Western states. In 2011, Diaz and David Hamblin won $2,000 with a fourth-place finish at Lake Roosevelt in Hunters, Washington.
</p><p>That involves more than just luck. Competitors do their homework – analyzing depth and currents, finding locals who can give them “inside” information on the lake where the competition will be held, visiting the site in advance to plan strategies.
</p><p>The fishing club is just one of many opportunities for CSUMB students to participate in outdoor recreation and intramural sports.
