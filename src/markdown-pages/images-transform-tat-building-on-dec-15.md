<p>The Teldramatic Arts and Technology Building will become a giant canvas on Dec. 15 when students project their work onto the building.
</p><p>The videos were created as final projects in Ben Wood’s TAT 421, Motion Graphics class. They include composited and animated graphics, images and sound. The first video will be screened at 5:45 p.m. onto the front façade of the building. The show will last about an hour.
</p><p>The best place for viewing the projections will be directly in front of the building on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>In his own work as a visual artist, Wood has done a number of large-scale public projections. (View a video of his projection onto Coit Tower in San Francisco <a href="http://www.coitlive.com">here</a>.)
</p><p>“The focus is to produce graphics to be integrated with the architecture of the building in order to animate the structure as an alternative form of electronic cinema . . . as a showcase of what is going on within TAT,” Wood said.
</p><p>During the semester, the class has “covered the tools and methodologies to create animated video, graphics and text which may be applied to fields such as special effects, advertising and independent visual projects,” Wood said.
</p><p>The class created this <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/550337">piece earlier </a>in the semester. It’s representative of the work that will be shown on Dec. 15.
