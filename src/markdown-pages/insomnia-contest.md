<h4>TAT students; work makes Apple's top-25 list</h4><p>CSUMB's top entry in this year's Apple Computer Insomnia Film Festival is filled with all the creativity sleep-deprived students can muster.
</p><p>Only three minutes long and made in a single 24-hour period, the entry - called Smile - is hilariously over the top; it's about a washed-up clown who goes about his day with the haunting memories of his past.
</p><p>Apple, maker of computers and editing software used in filmmaking, posted a top-secret list of elements - special props, dialogue, settings, camera techniques - online on a Saturday in October. Each team had to choose three of the 10 elements to include in its movie. Then, the team had to write, cast, shoot, edit, score and upload its short masterpiece within 24 hours.
</p><p>Once the films were posted online, the public was invited to watch and rate their favorites. The 25 entries with the highest rating on Nov. 9 were screened by industry professionals including Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black), James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line) and Luis Valdez. The pros chose one of the award winners; the public chose one and tech folks chose one. The winners won a treasure trove of Apple goodies.
</p><p>Four groups from CSUMB were among the 3,000 high school and college teams to enter. Team Pup and Suds - Dane Bergerson, Cody Campbell, Adam Newacheck, Haley Pikhart and Derek Tekus - placed 21st, the best finish for an Otter team.
</p><p>They contest rules promised them a showing in a nearby Apple store, but that hasn't yet been arranged. Stay tuned.
