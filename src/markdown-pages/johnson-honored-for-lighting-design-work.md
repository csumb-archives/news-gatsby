<p>Stephanie Anne Johnson, professor in the Visual and Public Art Department, has received an award for her work as a lighting designer.
</p><p>The Lighting Artists in Dance Award provides funds to support artistic collaborations with choreographers and dance companies. Those collaborations will result in dance performances presented in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</p><p>Johnson is working with Anne Bluethenthal &amp; Dancers as the visual designer for <em>Skywatchers</em>, a multi-disciplinary performance project that will take place in the Tenderloin neighborhood.
</p><p>Working with the Community Housing Partnership and with formerly homeless residents, Johnson, the dance company and other artists will create three site-specific performances to be staged this fall and winter.
</p><p>For this project, she will combine stage lights, solar units, 35 mm slides and live-feed video projections.
</p><p>In a lighting design career that spans three decades, Johnson has designed shows for Cultural Odyssey, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Arizona Repertory Theater, La Mama Theater (N.Y.) Black Moon Theatre (Paris), Dimensions Dance Theater and ABD Productions. Her lighting design work has been seen in India, The Netherlands, Italy, France and Belgium. As a visual artist, she has exhibited at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, De Young Museum, Jewish Museum, Berkeley Art Museum and Intersection For The Arts.
