<p>Approximately 200 fourth- through ninth-graders are on campus during July for the annual Migrant Junior Otter Academy.</p><p>During the four&#45;week camp, students from 11 school districts take classes designed to improve their English skills; learn about college life and what it takes to be a successful student; and get a healthy dose of arts and technology instruction.
</p><p>Students and their families are eager for the opportunity. “We are not a residential program, so we have students getting on our buses at 6:05 a.m. in San Ardo and returning home around 5 p.m.,” said Carl Del Grande of the Office of Migrant Education, Region XVI.
</p><p>This year, students are getting technology instruction in the Monterey County Office of Education’s TechMobile, a computer classroom in a converted semi&#45;trailer that is parked next to the World Theater. Groups of students – up to 18 at a time – are using the high&#45;speed Internet workstations to learn computer skills.
</p><p>The lab is part of this year’s academy thanks to MCOE’s Media Center for Art, Education and Technology Foundation and its board member, Phil Esparza. Esparza, a longtime staff member at CSUMB, “has also been our link to our afternoon visual and performing arts classes with El Teatro Campesino,” Del Grande said.
</p><p>The theme of this year’s academy is <em>family</em>. “We have some really fun family&#45;based projects for our students,” Del Grande said.
</p><p>The closing ceremony will be held on July 30, with El Teatro founding artistic director Luis Valdez scheduled to address the students and their family members.
</p><p>Seven years ago, CSUMB partnered with the Monterey County Office of Migrant Education, Region XVI, to develop the program. In 2010, the National Migrant Education Conference recognized it as an outstanding example of a collaborative effort. In 2012, it was selected for a Golden Bell Award from the California School Boards Association.
