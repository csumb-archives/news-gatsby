</p><h4>Almanzan recognized by news group for second consecutive year
	 </h4><p>KAZU news director Krista Almanzan was honored Nov. 6 by the Radio-Television News Directors Association of Northern California at the organization’s annual awards dinner in San Francisco. She was recognized in the category of best feature reporting on a serious subject for “Rec Rehab Program Hooks National Interest.” The story profiled a group called the Monterey Bay Veterans, which holds fishing derbies on Monterey Bay as part of its recreational rehabilitation program for disabled veterans.
</p><p>She won a regional Edward R. Murrow Award last spring for the same story.

</p><p>Almanzan started her journalism career in Iowa where she covered the 2000 and 2004 presidential races and Iowa caucuses for local television stations. In 2005, she won the Stanley Foundation Award for Outstanding Broadcast Coverage of Iowa’s global connections. Later that year, she returned to her home state of California, where she continued to work in television and simultaneously got her start in public radio as a freelance reporter with Capital Public Radio in Sacramento. In 2007, she joined the staff at KAZU where she serves as host of All Things Considered as well as news director.
</p><p>This is the second consecutive year that Almanzan has been honored by the NorCal RTNDA. Last year, she took top honors in the feature category for a story about a program called Take the Lead, which pairs at-risk youngsters with dogs surrendered to the local SPCA.
