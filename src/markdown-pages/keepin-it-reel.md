<p>The Salinas Project, a feature-length documentary about the lives of four young adults in East Salinas, will be shown at Cal State Monterey Bay as part of the 14th annual Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival April 28 through May 1.</p><p>The festival features films that illuminate the lives and struggles of people in the United States and around the world. The programs are sponsored by the CSUMB chapter of the California Faculty Association.
</p><p><em>The Salinas Project</em> tells the stories of children of farmworkers who are succeeding in spite of their difficult life circumstances. It introduces us to Yajaira as she starts her first year of college; Lolo, a musician who played the French horn at Carnegie Hall; Fernanda, an activist who spoke in Washington, D.C., about youth efforts to combat violence; and Angel, who decided to return to his hometown after graduating from college to help his community.
