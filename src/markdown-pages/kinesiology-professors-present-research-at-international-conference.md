<p>Do physiological factors drive exercise addiction? Does substance abuse play a role? </p><p>CSU Monterey Bay kinesiology professors Brian Cook and Ryan Luke will present research to address these questions, among others, at the <a href="http://www.icba2016.org/">International Conference on Behavioral Addictions</a> in Geneva, Switzerland, March 14&#45;16.
</p><p>Drs. Cook and Luke, along with CSUMB kinesiology professors Lisa Leininger and Joanna Morrissey, authored the conference abstract focusing on physiological factors that may explain differences between being addicted to exercise and simply exercising a lot. The relationship between drug/alcohol use and exercise dependence &#40;or addiction&#41; was examined in a sample of 197 people, or “regular exercisers,” as stated in the abstract.

According to Dr. Cook, the research methodology analyzed group differences in exercise amount and intensity, sedentary behavior and substance abuse. “It would be helpful to identify a pattern of addictions that are similar,” Cook said. “This would suggest that a similar underlying mechanism, such as brain physiology, would contribute to exercise dependence.”
</p><p>Their results: exercise dependence had no association with substance abuse. However, effects of strenuous, intense exercise show increased stimulus in those at risk for exercise dependence. To put it simply, Dr. Cook said, some people are wired differently to respond to hard exercise. They get more of a “high” from increased endorphin release. Further research is needed to explain why, he said.
