  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., June 3, 2020</b> - The Koret Foundation, a Jewish
  philanthropic organization based in San Francisco, has donated $1.63 million
  to CSU Monterey Bay. The funds will be distributed over five years to be used
  for: supporting students to complete their college studies in four years,
  providing impactful research opportunities for first-generation scholars, and
  preparing young people for community and national leadership roles, a news
  release said.
</p>
<p>
  The foundation gave a total of more than $50 million in new grants to Bay Area
  colleges and universities at a time when many institutions were already
  dealing with significant organizational and funding issues, which are now even
  more pressing due to the coronavirus crisis. Other schools receiving varying
  amounts of grants include UC Berkeley, Stanford, University of San Francisco,
  City College of San Francisco and CSU East Bay.
</p>
<p>
  “Investing in the next generation of talent, innovation and leadership is
  critical in order to ensure that all students, including the disadvantaged,
  have the opportunity to lead productive and successful lives,” said Michael
  Boskin, foundation president.
</p>
<p>
  “Koret’s Higher Education Initiative seeks to support key academic
  institutions in the Bay Area and fund programs that can spark new thinking,
  facilitate partnerships, and contribute to student success. Universities were
  already facing challenges, which are now deepened and accelerated by the
  coronavirus and recession. We believe now is a critical time to provide
  long-term support for these institutions.”
</p>
<p>
  Altogether, the grants will directly benefit students, faculty and staff
  across 12 different schools, including nearly 2,000 first-generation Koret
  Scholars program participants, as well as thousands of recipients of
  scholarships, research grants, mentorship programs, career preparation and
  other services.
