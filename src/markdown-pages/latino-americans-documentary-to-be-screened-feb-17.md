<p>Talk by director Ray Telles will accompany the film showing</p><p>During the 2015&#45;16 school year, Cal State Monterey Bay has been showing films and offering public programs to celebrate <em>Latino Americans: 500 Years of History</em>, an exploration of the rich and varied experiences of the country’s largest minority group.

The six&#45;part documentary was created for the Public Broadcasting Service &#40;PBS&#41; in 2013. The local screenings are made possible through a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Library Association.

At 6 p.m., Feb. 17, another installment in the series will be shown at the CSUMB Music Hall on Sixth Avenue and Butler Street.
</p><p>“Peril and Promise" takes viewers through the years from 1980 to 2000. It examines how the nature of the Latino Diaspora changed, with a second wave of Cuban refugees and hundreds of thousands of Central Americans fleeing death squads and mass murders. By the early 1990s, a political debate over illegal immigration had begun.
</p><p>Globalization, empowered by NAFTA, means that as U.S. manufacturers move south, Mexican workers head north in record numbers. A backlash ensues, but a sea change is under way – the coalescence of a new phenomenon called Latino American culture – as Latinos spread geographically and make their mark in music, sports, politics, business and education.
</p><p>A talk by director and producer Ray Telles will precede the screening.
</p><p>The event is free and open to the public.
