<p>Earl Lawson was sworn in as the chief of police at Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 2, three weeks after university President Dianne Harrison named him to the position.
</p><p>Several dozen members of local law enforcement agencies joined the campus community to witness Nate Johnson, chief law enforcement officer for the California State University system, administer the traditional oath of office.
</p><p>Lawson’s wife, America, pinned the chief’s badge on while their daughter, Brianna, looked on.
</p><p>Lawson has served in a number of important roles since joining the University Police Department in 1995, most recently as operations lieutenant and briefly as interim police chief upon the retirement of former chief Fred Hardee in June.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison said Lawson was selected for the breadth of his experience, which includes special training in disaster preparedness and collaboration with local law enforcement. “Chief Lawson understands that the police department is essential to ensuring a safe environment for our students, employees and visitors and helping to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and personal growth,” she said. “I know he will do an outstanding job.” Praise came from Chief Johnson, who called Lawson “an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the big picture.” In his brief remarks, Lawson reiterated his commitment to the university. “This is my home; the people on this campus are my extended family. I’m heavily invested in the success of this university,” he said. His top priorities are to expand the university’s emergency preparedness and community policing programs. He promised to be “accessible and flexible,” and to “always do what I think is right for the community.” Lawson has a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Cal Poly Pomona and a minor certificate in criminal justice. His extensive professional education includes training at the FBI National Academy. He started his law enforcement career in 1993.
