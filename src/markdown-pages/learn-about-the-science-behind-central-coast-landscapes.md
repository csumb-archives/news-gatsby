<h3>CSUMB professor lectures at P.G. Museum of Natural History Jan. 23</h3><p>Artists and art lovers are drawn to spectacular Central Coast vistas. They paint and photograph rugged mountains, marine terraces, sea cliffs, landslides, tombolos and hoodoos. Just what are these landforms? The beauty of the Central Coast is the most recent expression of a very long geologic evolution. Discover "geomorphology," the scientific study of Earth surface processes and the landscapes they form. No background in geological study or artistic skill is needed to attend this talk by Dr. Doug Smith, a geologist and chair of the Division of Science and Environmental Policy at CSU Monterey Bay. The talk will start at 7 p.m. Admission is $5 at the door. The museum is located at 165 Forest Ave., Pacific Grove.
