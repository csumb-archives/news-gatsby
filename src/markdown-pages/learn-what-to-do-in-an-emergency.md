<h4>Preparedness Fair set for Sept. 11</h4><p>Should a disaster strike, university officials want campus community members to be prepared, educated on what to do and have the resources and training to be emergency-ready.
</p><p>A good place to start is the Otter Preparedness Fair, which will be held from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sept. 11 on the campus quad. The third annual event is sponsored by the Emergency Management, Health and Safety Division of the University Police Department.
</p><p>Attendees will learn how to prepare themselves, their families, pets, homes and communities for an emergency. They can sign up for first aid, CPR and automatic external defibrillator (AED) training as well as Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training.
</p><p>Information will be distributed, equipment and emergency vehicles will be on display and demonstrations of AED use, fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and first aid/CPR will be held.
</p><p>"In organizing this fair, our primary goal is to empower our community, to bring more people into the preparedness circle and to get them ready for a disaster," said Dick Bower, CSUMB’s emergency manager. "Everyone should be prepared and this fair is really intended for anyone who knows he or she should be prepared but doesn't know where to start."
</p><p>The fair is supported by several community partners and agencies – including fire departments from Seaside and the Presidio of Monterey; CalFire; American Medical Response; American Red Cross; Monterey County Health Department, Office of Emergency Services and Sheriff’s Department; and local CERT teams – demonstrating the interaction and cooperation needed in emergencies.
</p><p>CSUMB's efforts to prepare for natural disasters have won recognition from the National Weather Service – the university was named a Weather-Ready Nation Ambassador and a Storm Ready university. <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/jun/26/csumb-recognized-preparedness-efforts">Read more here.</a>
