<p>In an effort to maximize the education students receive outside the classroom, CSUMB now offers residents the opportunity to live in “themed” learning communities.
</p><p>Students can choose to live on residence hall floors set aside for those interested in science and math, outdoor adventure, liberal studies or business. While no academic content is tied to the living arrangement, leisure-time activities are scheduled around the topics.
</p><p>Freshmen also have the option of participating in Project Higher Ground, where they live in residence halls with a group of students who take at least two courses together.
