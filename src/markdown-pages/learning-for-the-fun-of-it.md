<p>What do U.S. foreign policy, Don DeLillo and the physiology and disorders of sleep have in common?</p><p>They are among a diverse range of classes that will be offered in the spring through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute – OLLI – at California State University, Monterey Bay. The courses and speakers are specifically geared for those 50 and better.
</p><p>And the classes are filling up quickly.
</p><p>OLLI at CSU Monterey Bay, with support from the Bernard Osher Foundation, is part of a national network that recognizes learning and exploration have no age limits. Members are inspired to take a fresh look at themselves, their world, and the possibilities that await them.
</p><p>Among the course offerings are a variety of writing classes, an examination of two Shakespearean comedies, several film classes – from documentaries to Raymond Chandler – and a wildlife adventure at Elkhorn Slough.

Former Assemblymember Fred Keeley is back with a three&#45;session class looking at the primary election in California.

New this semester is a look at climate change, and an examination of brain chemistry and behavior. Also new: three events will be held at the Steinbeck Center in Oldtown Salinas, a facility recently acquired by Cal State Monterey Bay. They include a lecture on the ancient Greeks, a writing workshop, and a three&#45;session series featuring an insider’s view of the key challenges within local government.
</p><p>Individual class offerings can be purchased, or attendees can sign up for a spring semester membership – which includes up to three courses for $105. Membership includes discounts on World Theater tickets and athletic events on campus.
