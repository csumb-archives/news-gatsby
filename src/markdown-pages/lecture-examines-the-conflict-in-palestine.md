<p>Journalist Ben Ehrenreich will visit Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 10 to lecture on “Is This the Third Intifada? Understanding the Conflict in Palestine.”</p><p>“Intifada” is an Arabic word that is often translated into English as “uprising,” “resistance,” or “rebellion.” In the Palestinian context, with which it is usually associated, the word refers to attempts to "shake off" the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
</p><p>Ehrenreich studied religion at Brown University, and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he still lives. He has reported from Afghanistan, Haiti, Cambodia, El Salvador, Mexico and all over the United States. His articles and essays have been published in LA Weekly, Los Angeles Magazine, the Village Voice, the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and many other publications.

His awards include the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Journalism, National Magazine Award, GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Magazine Article, and an artist residency at the Sundance Institute Writing Program.

His talk will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. in the conference rooms of the University Center, located at Sixth Avenue and B Street. The event is free, but attendees must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot.

The lecture is sponsored by the Division of Humanities and Communication; the Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies; and the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
