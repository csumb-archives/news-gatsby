<p>The first university textbook on human sexuality to be published in China was co-authored by a CSU Monterey Bay faculty member. 
</p><p>After the seventh edition of  “Human Sexuality: Diversity in Contemporary America” by Barbara Sayad of CSUMB and Bill Yarber of Indiana University and the Kinsey Institute was published recently, the authors were approached about the possibility of having it translated into Chinese.
</p><p>Several issues surfaced immediately.
</p><p>Because it’s illegal to be gay or lesbian in China, the government would not approve the book for use in public universities, and cultural biases and assumptions needed to be addressed. After numerous phone calls, e-mails and meetings, these issues were resolved to everyone's satisfaction.
</p><p>McGraw-Hill agreed to release the textbook as a trade publication to circumvent censorship issues. The Chinese professors who served as volunteer translators did their work in a way that was culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs and concerns of university students. And while the book won't be sold on campuses, it is available in public bookstores.
</p><p>At CSUMB, Dr. Sayad teaches human sexuality, women's health, marriage and family, and wellness with a focus on service learning.
