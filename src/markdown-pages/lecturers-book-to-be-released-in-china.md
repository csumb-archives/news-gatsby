</p><p>The first university textbook on human sexuality is about to be published in China, and a CSU Monterey Bay lecturer is one of its co-authors. 
</p><p>The seventh edition of "Human Sexuality: Diversity in Contemporary America" by Barbara Sayad of CSUMB (pictured at left) and Bill Yarber of Indiana University and the Kinsey Institute has recently been published. According to McGraw-Hill, the book's publisher, it has been lauded by both students and instructors for providing a non-judgmental view of sexual orientation and as such, is one of the leading sexuality textbooks in the field.
</p><p>After its release, the authors were contacted by Damien Lu, a professor at UCLA who is a gay activist and host of a Chinese underground radio talk show, about the possibility of having the book translated into Chinese. 
</p><p>According to Lu, of all the sexuality books on the American market – and there are many – Sayad and Yarber's is the most inclusive of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered and questioning community. And it is the most empirical.
</p><p>Several issues surfaced immediately.
</p><p>Because it's illegal to be gay or lesbian in China, the government would not approve the book for use in public universities, and cultural biases and assumptions needed to be addressed.
</p><p>After numerous phone calls, e-mails and meetings, these issues were resolved to everyone's satisfaction.
</p><p>McGraw-Hill agreed to release the textbook as a trade publication to circumvent censorship issues. And while it won't be sold on campuses, it will be available in public bookstores.
</p><p>And Chinese professors who served as volunteer translators did their work in a way that was culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs and concerns of university students.
</p><p>As the Sept. 1 release date draws closer, both authors look at this as one of their greatest professional honors.
</p><p>But they're not resting on their laurels. They will begin work on the eighth edition of the book early next year.
</p><p>At CSUMB, Dr. Sayad teaches human sexuality, women's health, marriage and family, and wellness with a focus on service learning. She holds a Ph.D. in health and human behavior, a Master's of Public Health in community health education, and a bachelor's degree in foods and nutrition.
