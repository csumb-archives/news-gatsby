<h3>Automated exteral defibrillators: there when you need them</h3><h3></h3><p>Over the summer, the campus became a safer place . . . for victims of a heart attack.
</p><p>Lifesaving devices called Automated External Defibrillators – or AEDs – were installed in a dozen buildings, courtesy of the University Police Department’s Otter Public Access AED Program.
</p><p>AEDs have proven to save lives when used on a heart attack victim within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.
</p><p>“The goal of the university is to provide a safe and healthy campus for our community members,” said Dick Bower, CSUMB’s emergency manager. “This new program takes ‘safe and healthy’ to a new level with trained people and modern technology in place to offer rapid, effective treatment to heart attack victims.”
</p><p>They are housed in marked white cabinets in common areas of these buildings:
</p><p>• Otter Sports Center • Police Department • Alumni and Visitors Center • Dining Commons • Student Center • Chapman Science Academic Center • Tanimura &amp; Antle Library • World Theater • University Center • Osher Lifelong Learning Institute • Information Technology • Student Services The AEDs are easy to use, requiring only three steps to hook up and deliver the shock. Training is available on request.
</p><p>Training is also offered through monthly First Aid/CPR/AED classes available for free to the campus community. The classes are offered in cooperation with American Medical Response, a regional ambulance company, and CalFIRE.
</p><p>“We thank the university administration, our partners in Facilities Services and Operations, American Medical Response and CalFIRE for their assistance in making this program available,” Bower said.
</p><p>For more information about the AED program or to schedule a training session, contact Bower at 582-3589 or <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x64;&#98;&#x6f;&#119;e&#x72;&#64;&#x63;&#115;u&#x6d;&#98;&#x2e;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">dbower@csumb.edu</a>.
