  to campus. Lime representatives held a pop-up demonstration at CSUMB Friday,
  September 28, 2018 to introduce the electric scooters and give demonstrations.

<p>
  All of Lime’s scooters are GPS and 3G-enabled, making it simple for riders to
  find, unlock and pick up a nearby vehicle using their smartphone. When the
  ride is finished, riders simply end the ride with the Lime mobile app and
  responsibly park by the street curb, or at a bike rack.

  can also be found in the app.

  Lime currently operates in over 100 markets, and is the largest shared bike
  and scooter provider in the U.S. Over 11.5 million rides have already taken
  place on the Lime platform since first launching just over year ago.
