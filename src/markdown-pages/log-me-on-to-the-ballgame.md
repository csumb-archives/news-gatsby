<h3>Watch the Otters online</h3><p>The Internet has sparked an evolution in college sports viewing, and CSUMB has picked up on the trend.
</p><p>Colleges and universities nationwide are increasingly video-streaming their sporting events on their websites. It’s a way to broaden fan support for schools whose games are not televised and make games available to family and alumni living outside the region.
</p><p>At CSUMB, all home basketball and volleyball games are broadcast online. To find the broadcast, visit otherathletics.com and click on the “live audio/video/stats” tab on the right-hand side.
</p><p>While soccer, baseball and softball games are not broadcast, live, play-by-play statistics are available online at the same web address.
</p><p>It’s also possible to follow the Otters on the road. Live stats of men’s and women’s basketball and volleyball games have been mandated by the California Collegiate Athletic Association and are available via the CCAA Network at <a href="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx" title="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx">http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx</a>.
</p><p>In addition, some schools – such as Sonoma State, Cal State Stanislaus and Cal State L.A. – provide video streaming of their home games. Broadcasts can be accessed via the CCAA Network.
</p><p>The Jan. 28 women’s basketball game at home to Cal Poly Pomona is a good time to check out the streaming video. The Otters lead the CCAA with a 12-0 conference record. Tip-off is 5:30 p.m.
</p><p>Part of what's driving the trend is that the Internet has increasingly become the main communication tool in college athletics.
</p><p>That also creates new opportunity for smaller schools.
</p><p>"We don't get the media exposure that the Division I schools get. We're not on TV. This is our opportunity to get our exposure and develop our fan base," said Mindy Mills, CSUMB’s sports information director. "This helps us get more exposure outside the boundaries of our campus."
</p><p>For those who prefer more traditional media, all Otter men's basketball games – home and away – are broadcast on KION 1460 AM in the Monterey Bay area.
