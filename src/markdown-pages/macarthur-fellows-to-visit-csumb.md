<h3>Award-winners hope to inspire students</h3><p>The MacArturos – well, some of them – are coming to Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Each year since 1981, the MacArthur Foundation has given no-strings-attached grants to individuals who show exceptional merit and promise of continued creative work. The recipients come from all fields. The awards have become known as “genius grants.”
</p><p>Latino awardees banded together as the MacArturos, with the goal of supporting each other’s activist efforts and sharing their work with <em>la comunidad</em>, according to the website of writer Sandra Cisneros, who organized the first meeting in San Antonio in 1997.
</p><p>The group originally came together as a reunion, to inspire Latino youth. Over the years, meetings have been held in San Jose, Los Angeles, Toledo and Chicago.
</p><p>Ten Latino MacArthur Fellows will visit CSUMB on Jan. 26. In a roundtable format at the World Theater, they will provide insight into their influences, inspirations and practices.
</p><p>Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains, a retired faculty member at CSUMB and a 1992 MacArthur Fellow, invited the group to campus.
</p><p>“For some time, I have wanted to have the MacArturos come here because I know they will be inspirational for our students – the majority of whom are the first in their family to attend college, and more than a third of whom are Latino,” Dr. Mesa-Bains said.
</p><p>“I think they are engaging for all students, but serve as special role models for our Latino students.”
</p><p>The free event will start at 6 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. The public is invited.
</p><p>The group will participate in a public event in Salinas before heading to campus. The next day, they will travel to San Francisco for events in the Mission District.

</p><p>• Amalia Mesa-Bains, artist, educator, cultural rights advocate and professor emerita at CSUMB
