<h3>70-day service challenge kicks off Jan. 21</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay students will observe Martin Luther King’s birthday on Jan. 21 by participating in a march in Seaside and helping with a food and clothing drive in Marina.
</p><p>??That day will also mark the start of the university's King/Chavez Semester of Service Challenge, a 70-day community service drive that will run through Cesar Chavez Day, March 31.
</p><p>The Purposeful Service Opportunities program, a joint project of the AmeriCorps VIP program and CSUMB's Service Learning Institute, will coordinate the drive. Students can select from a list of volunteer opportunities or come up with their own. The theme for this year’s challenge is “What Are You Doing for Others?,” and involves a friendly competition among student clubs, Greek organizations, athletic teams and residence halls to document 5,000 hours of service. An awards presentation and celebration will be held on April 26, Global Youth Service Day. This year, extra points will be awarded for uploading photos to a Facebook page that show volunteers in CSUMB attire or colors at work. Extra points will also be awarded for philanthropic efforts, such as fundraisers and food drives, and for civic engagement, such as participation in student government and attendance at city council meetings. <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/king-chavez-semester-service-challenge">Registration, contest rules and point system can be found here.</a>  <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/">Learn more about CSUMB's Service Learning Institute.</a>
