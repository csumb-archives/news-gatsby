<p>COLLEGE IS FOR YOU, ADMINISTRATORS TELL CHURCH MEMBERS</p>
<p>
  Parishioners at two local churches will get more than a sermon at the Feb. 28
  services. They’ll get a pitch for the value of a college education – straight
  from the pulpit.

<p>
  Cal State Monterey Bay administrators will visit churches in Seaside that day
  as part of a California State University program called Super Sunday.
</p>
<p>
  At approximately 11:15 a.m., President Eduardo Ochoa is scheduled to address
  the congregation at Greater Victory Temple. At 11 a.m., Associate Vice
  President for University Affairs Andre Lewis will speak at New Hope Baptist
  Church. They will discuss the importance of getting a college degree for
  today’s competitive job market, when to start planning for college, programs
  offered at CSUMB, financial aid and parent involvement. Following the
  services, staff members from CSUMB and church education advisers will provide
  information on the application and admission process, including virtual tours
  through CSUmentor, the websitet hat helps students apply for college. One of
  the publications to be distributed during the visits is the “How to Get to
  College” poster, which provides middle and high school students and their
  parents with step&#45;by&#45;step information on the path to college. Now in
  its 11th year, Super Sunday is part of an educational outreach led by the CSU
  African American Initiative – a partnership with churches – to increase
  college preparation, student enrollment and graduation rates among African
  American students. More than 110 churches throughout the state will host CSU
  representatives during February. For more information, contact CSUMB’s Office
  of Admissions at 582&#45;3738.
