</p><p><strong>UROC PLAYS BIG ROLE IN SUCCESS OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EFFORTS</strong>
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay students took a first&#45;place award and a third at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science conference Sept. 30&#45;Oct. 3 in Anaheim.
</p><p>Maren Mitch, a McNair Scholar who works in the campus laboratory of Professor Corey Garza, won first prize in the undergraduate poster competition in marine biology. Approximately 60 posters were entered in that category.
</p><p>Mitch &#40;pictured at left&#41; is a senior Environmental Science, Technology and Policy major.
</p><p>According to Dr. Garza, "The judging was razor thin. The deciding factor was the fact that in addition to having a broader understanding of her project's relevance, it was clear to the judges that Maren was conducting her own research as opposed to working on a small part of a larger project."
</p><p>Mitch looked at how to use GIS models to predict the distribution and abundance of sea stars as a function of intertidal habitat complexity in Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Dr. Garza added that the judges were impressed that CSUMB students are able to integrate geospatial technologies into their research as undergraduates.
</p><p>Anthony Basilio, another marine science student, took third place. He is studying fish bio&#45;mechanics at Moss Landing Marine Labs.
</p><p>Both students are part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center. With training and support from UROC, students work on innovative research projects at CSU Monterey Bay and at regional research institutions. Their work is guided by a research mentor and includes training in proposal writing, presentation and communication skills. It also helps students apply to graduate school. <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Learn more about UROC.</a>
</p><p>SACNAS presents the poster sessions at its annual conference to help students prepare for science careers and the rigors of professional conferences.
