<p>
  Outstanding research by CSU Monterey Bay students on topics ranging from bat
  foraging to visitor engagement at museums was presented at a competition in
  late April at CSU Bakersfield.
</p>
<p>
  The CSU Student Research Competition is held each spring to promote excellence
  in undergraduate and graduate scholarly research and creative activity by
  recognizing outstanding student accomplishments across the 23 CSU campuses.
</p>
<p>
  Marine biology student Madison Heard took second place with her research on
  the impacts of ocean acidification on abalone. She started the work last
  summer as part of CSUMB’s 10&#45;week Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science
  Research Experiences for Undergraduates &#40;REU&#41; program funded by the
  National Science Foundation. Student projects were selected by a committee of
  CSUMB’s Faculty Senate. At the competition, students made 10&#45;minute oral
  presentations before juries of experts from major corporations, foundations,
  public agencies, colleges and universities. The judges also reviewed each
  student’s research paper. One graduate student and nine undergraduates from
  CSUMB were among the 200 students who presented their work in 20 categories.
