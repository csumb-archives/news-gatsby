  Jazz-playing brothers Remy and Pascal Le Boeuf will present a master class at
  Cal State Monterey Bay on May 7. The public is invited to join students in the
  university’s Music and Performing Arts Department at this free event, which
  will get under way at 7 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The twins – keyboardist Pascal and saxophonist/clarinetist Remy – are talented
  musicians and award&#45;winning composers who are a part of the new breed of
  young artists as influenced by Radiohead as they are by Herbie Hancock.

<p>
  In 2004, the Santa Cruz natives moved to New York, where they established
  their musical voices as performers and composers. Their last album, "Le Boeuf
  BrothersRemixed," has been nominated in the Best Eclectic Album category at
  the Independent Music Awards.

  The <a href="https://csumb.edu/maps">Music Hall</a> is located on Sixth Avenue
  and Butler Street on the CSUMB campus. While the class is free, visitors must
  purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot.
