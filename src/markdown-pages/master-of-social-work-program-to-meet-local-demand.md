<p>Veronica Gonzalez works with young people in her position with Monterey County's Division of Behavioral Health, helping them transition into adulthood. She's enthusiastic about her job, and she's eager to advance in her career. To do that, she needs a master's degree in social work. Until now, she would have to leave the area to accomplish that. With a full-time job and an eight-month-old baby, "I didn't want to waste time commuting to a school outside of my community," Gonzalez said.
</p><p>Starting this fall, she won't have to leave the area.
</p><p>Until July 10, CSU Monterey Bay will accept applications for its new Master of Social Work program that will start in August. The plan calls for 50 students to be accepted into the first class.
</p><p>"The MSW program is an excellent example of the university collaborating with community partners in order to meet critical workforce needs," said CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison. "My own background is in social work so I am especially pleased that CSUMB will play an important educational role in preparing future professionals who will be equipped to address significant social issues in our region."
</p><p>There has long been a need for people with MSW degrees in the region. Before the university even opened its doors in 1995, discussions had been held about establishing a social work program. A variety of issues intervened.
</p><p>With the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, funding became available. The Mental Health Services Act added a 1 percent tax on personal incomes over $1 million. The money is funneled to county mental health programs; some of it is earmarked for workforce development. Monterey County's Behavioral Health Division has used some of that money to support the development of the university's MSW program.
</p><p>"Once people leave the area for education, they often don't come back," said Dr. Mayleen True, director of the new program (pictured at left). "And because of the cost of living here, it's been hard for local agencies to recruit MSWs.
</p><p>"The solution is to grow our own."
</p><p>In her position as executive vice president of the Kinship Center, Carol Bishop has first-hand experience with the situation Dr. True described.
</p><p>"For years we have hired wonderful young staff who have had to leave us to go out of the area in order to continue their education, and we lose this talent," Ms. Bishop said.
</p><p>"We all want to provide the very best quality services to our communities, and this new MSW program will allow us to do so with graduates who understand this community, because it is <em>their</em> community."
</p><p>The program has grown out of a strong university-community partnership with a variety of agencies and organizations involved in the planning process, helping to develop the curriculum and the resources needed to implement it. Among the community partners are Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties, and nonprofit organizations including the Kinship Center, Interim, Inc., Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, Dominican Hospital of Santa Cruz and the local Veterans Administration clinic.
</p><p>"Licensed, bilingual, home-grown social workers are severely needed in this community, whether to address the trauma of gang violence, treat the post-traumatic stress disorder of our veterans, provide counseling to those with emotional problems that often accompany chronic health conditions, or increase the number of trained counselors in our schools," said Dr. Wayne Clark, Monterey County Behavioral Health director.
</p><p>"The community expressed their support, leaders rolled up their sleeves, and the vision of a local graduate social work program is at hand. As a community, we can be proud of this accomplishment," Dr. Clark said.
</p><p>Since people currently employed with local government agencies and nonprofits are the likely students, classes will be offered in the evenings. The three-year program will allow students to concentrate in Behavioral Health or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year.
</p><p>While working adults are the primary candidates, recent college graduates are also encouraged to apply. Financial aid will be available.
</p><p>For some people, the program can't start soon enough.
</p><p>"I have waited six years for this program to start here in the Monterey Bay area. It feels great to say that I grew up here, received my education here and work here, all in my community," Gonzalez said.
