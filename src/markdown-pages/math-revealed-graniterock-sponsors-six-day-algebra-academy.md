<p>Dozens of students from Rolling Hills Middle School in Wattsonville voluntarily spent their last week of winter break studying algebra – and having fun.
</p><p>The Algebra Academy was held at the headquarters of the Graniterock company in Watsonville from Jan. 3 through 6. On Friday of that week, the youngsters spent the day on the campus of Cal State Monterey Bay and then returned to Graniterock for a graduation ceremony on Saturday.
</p><p>CSUMB math faculty member Dr. Hongde Hu and lecturer Lorraine O’Shea taught the classes, assisted by four university students.
</p><p>The goal was to get students up to speed with standards recently adopted by the California Department of Education that mandate preparation in algebra. The students worked with tablet PCs provided to CSUMB by Hewlett Packard as part of an EdTech Innovators grant it awarded the university last year – one of only 10 given out worldwide.

</p><p>Graniterock CEO Bruce Woolpert and assistant general counsel Kevin Jeffery spearheaded the academy.
</p><p>The company has worked with Rolling Hills for four years, sending tutors from the company to help with English, art, math and science, as well as hosting events such as awards ceremonies for students who get good grades.
</p><p>“The academy is also intended to build a strong math foundation through hands-on activities with algebra applications in the real world,” Dr. Hu said.
</p><p>Among the problems students worked on were figuring the odds of winning a state lottery and determining why California license plates need three letters.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the middle school students spent time in a math classroom where they played a game called “Survivor: Math Camp” that called on the skills they learned earlier in the week. They also got a campus tour, ate in the dining hall and learned what steps they should follow to prepare for college.
</p><p>Their campus visit clearly made an impression. Some indicated the experience made them want to attend college, especially CSUMB.
</p><p>Rolling Hills principal Rick Ito appreciated the opportunity for his students to participate in the program.
</p><p>“I think the important thing is that students have seen math in a different way,” Ito said. “It’s not just in a classroom. It’s all around us.”
</p><p>He also complimented the work of the CSUMB students.
</p><p>“The four teaching assistants really made a connection with the students,” Ito said. “They’re a bridge between the professors and the youngsters, and they’ve done a great job.”
