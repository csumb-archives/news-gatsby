<p>Hugo Morales, who built a community radio station for California farmworkers into a national Latino public media network, will be the keynote speaker at CSU Monterey Bay’s commencement ceremony on May 16. </p><p>In 1976, Morales organized farmworkers, teachers, students and artists to launch Radio Bilingüe as a single public radio station for the large Latino communities of Fresno and the surrounding San Joaquin Valley.
</p><p>At the time, Morales, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was an adjunct professor of La Raza Studies at Fresno State. Ever since, he has been executive director of Radio Bilingüe and a pioneer and advocate for bilingual and minority&#45;controlled public media throughout the country. The network now includes 11 stations in California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.
</p><p>A Mixtec Indian from Oaxaca, Mexico, he was a child farmworker in Sonoma County. When he was appointed to the California State University Board of Trustees in 2012, he said, “My interest in education is part of my DNA. I know how an excellent college education changed my life, and I know the stakes now for students with the same hopes and dreams that I had for myself and my family.
</p><p>“Radio Bilingüe itself is first and foremost about education and ensuring access to information for those who are underserved.”
</p><p>His honors include a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, the Edward R. Murrow Award – public broadcasting’s highest honor – and the Lannan Foundation Cultural Freedom Award.
</p><p>CSUMB’s <a href="https://csumb.edu/commencement">19th commencement</a> will take place at 10 a.m. in Freeman Stadium on the CSUMB campus with President Eduardo Ochoa presiding. Approximately 1,450 students will receive bachelor’s and master’s degrees; about 8,000 family members and friends are expected to attend.
