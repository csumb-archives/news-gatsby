<p>Play explores gender violence issues from male perspective</p><p>Following on the heels of Eve Ensler’s “Vagina Monologues,” CSU Monterey Bay students continue their campaign to end sexual violence against women with three performances of  “The MENding Monologues.”
</p><p>Performances will be held at 8 p.m., April 7, 8 and 9, at the World Theater, located at Sixth Avenue between A and B streets.
</p><p>Both a bookend and male response to Ensler’s play – which has been produced at CSUMB for 15 years – Derek Dujardin’s production borrows the monologue format, featuring stories of how men are affected when violence is waged against women.
</p><p>Using first&#45;person monologues, sketch comedy and poetry, men take the audience on an emotional and educational roller&#45;coaster ride through relationships and gender issues to create a healing experience. The show includes pieces from women and transgender people.
</p><p>The all&#45;student production is directed by Aly Macdeo and produced by Joe Meeker. Danielle Danielson is the co&#45;producer.
</p><p>Tickets are $7 for students and $10 for everyone else. An American Sign Language interpreter will be available at Friday’s performance.
</p><p>For more information or to request disability accommodations, contact Meeker at jmeeker@csumb.edu.
</p><p>The play is sponsored by the student club EMPOWER, which works to raise awareness of sexual assault and gender violence and to promote a positive and safe place for survivors, allies and friends to connect, share stories and educate the community.
</p><p>How pervasive is the issue of violence against women?
</p><p>The National Institute of Justice found that about one in five women and 6 percent of men are victims of sexual assault while in college. According to data collected under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Crime Statistics Act in 2012, college campuses reported 3,900 forcible sex offenses. &#40;Source: U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights&#41;
