<p>Jamie Tworkowski didn’t expect to start an internationally known organization. He didn’t do it for money, praise or fame.
</p><p>His motivation was simple – he started a suicide prevention group to help a friend.
</p><p>The founder of To Write Love on Her Arms – a global movement dedicated to presenting hope and finding help for those who suffer from depression, addiction, self-injury and suicidal tendencies – will speak Oct. 3 at CSU Monterey Bay’s World Theater. Doors will open at 7 p.m., the program will start at 7:30.
</p><p>Sharing the stage with a special guest musician, he will lead a conversation about issues that millions live with but few talk about.
</p><p>"To Write Love on Her Arms" is the title of a story Tworkowski wrote in 2006. It was the true story of five days he spent with a friend, Renee, who was denied entry into a drug treatment center in Orlando, Fla. As a way to pay for her treatment, Tworkowski posted a blog on Myspace and began selling T-shirts.
</p><p>Tworkowski created the Florida-based nonprofit organization and made it his life's work after he learned the sobering statistics that two of three people with depression do not get help, and that the third leading cause of death among 18- to 24-year-olds is suicide.
</p><p>Sparked by the support of bands including Switchfoot, Anberlin and Paramore, TWLOHA T-shirts quickly became a phenomenon within the music world and the group's message spread from venue to venue all over the world. The organization now has the largest online audience of any nonprofit on Myspace and Facebook, where it is "liked" by more than 1.2 million people. TWLOHA encourages, informs and invests directly in treatment and recovery organizations, having donated more than $850,000 to date. The organization has seen thousands taking first steps toward getting help, and others learning to help their friends or have honest conversations for the first time. Tworkowski shares his vision of hope with a simple message: "You are not alone and this is not the end of your story."
</p><p>NBC Nightly News, CBS Sunday Morning, CNN, MTV, Rolling Stone and SPIN Magazine have interviewed him. He speaks frequently, bringing a message of hope and community to audiences at colleges and concerts throughout the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.
</p><p>"Renee," a film based on the life story of the young woman who inspired TWLOHA, is set for release next year.
</p><p>Tickets are free for CSUMB students and $10 for the public at the door.
</p><p>Associated Students, the Personal Growth and Counseling Center and the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development sponsor the program. It is presented as part of CSUMB’s celebration of Mental Health Awareness Week. More information can be found on the organization's <a href="http://www.twloha.com">website</a>.
