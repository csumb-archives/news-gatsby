</p><p><strong><em>Performer's act is magical entertainment</em></strong>
</p><p>Andy Gross has been described as a Renaissance man. During his one-man performances, he might throw his voice, perform a magic trick, and then bend a spoon with his mind. He may do a little stand-up comedy, and then haul out his ventriloquist's dummy. He brings all of these talents to California State University, Monterey Bay's World Theater at 7:30 p.m. on March 4 in "Mind Boggling: The Show."
</p><p>The performance blends comedy, magic, illusion, theater and ventriloquism together to create an evening of entertainment suitable for the whole family.
</p><p>Andy's show will be the first of its kind in the World Theater Performing Arts Series.
</p><p>"We have looked at both comedy and magic in the past, but either the scheduling didn't work or the shows were not quite the right fit," said Joe Cardinalli, World Theater director.
</p><p>"Andy's show is uniquely entertaining and combines the best onstage craft of humor and spectacle. His show is inspired by decades of tradition from vaudeville-style shows, but his delivery is completely contemporary. It's the kind of show that everyone can enjoy, regardless of age or experience," Cardinalli said.
</p><p>Andy has been performing since he was 8 years old. He has appeared on network and cable TV - in Beverly Hills 90210, the Jenny Jones Comedy Headline Special and Just the Ten of Us - is a frequent performer in Las Vegas and at comedy clubs and has entertained at corporate events, including Fortune 500 companies such as Enterprise, IBM and Microsoft.
</p><p>He often works as a technical consultant on magic, ventriloquism and the paranormal for television shows and movies. Pieces from his large collection of ventriloquist dummies are used as props for TV shows, stage productions and films.
</p><p>" 'Mindboggling: The Show' provides an affordable opportunity for friends and family to come together, enjoy quality entertainment, and leave the outside world behind for a little while," Cardinalli said.
</p><p>Tickets range from $10 to $40. Special offer: buy-one, get-one-free. Tickets may be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580 or online at <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">csumb.edu/worldtheater</a>.
</p><p>The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue on the CSUMB campus. Driving directions and a campus map are available at CSUMB.edu/map.
