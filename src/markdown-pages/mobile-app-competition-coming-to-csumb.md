<p>Now is the time for students to register for the annual Startup Hackathon Monterey Bay. This year’s event will be held Nov. 20-22 on the campus of Cal State Monterey Bay.</p><p>The hackathon is an intense three&#45;day mobile app development competition where students design, develop and demonstrate innovative mobile applications using Android technology.
</p><p>Teams of students, with help from mentors, produce real, working prototype applications for local nonprofits or small businesses. The event kicks off on Nov. 20 at 4 p.m., when Monterey Bay organizations propose ideas for apps. Teams come together to choose an idea and have the rest of the weekend to build a working prototype app before presenting their work to the public on Sunday afternoon.
</p><p>The competition is open to students from all colleges in the region. Students may enter as individuals and join a team during the event, or enter as already&#45;existing teams.

The event will be held in the university’s new Business and Information Technology building, located next to the Tanimura &amp; Antle library. Cost is $20. Food will be provided during the weekend.

Organizers are also looking for app ideas from local nonprofit organizations and small businesses. Last year, apps were created for Sun Street Centers and Save Our Shores.
