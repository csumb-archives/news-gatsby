<p>The Vagina Monologues returns to CSU Monterey Bay Feb. 11, 12 and 13.

The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the Vagina Monologues tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world. CSUMB's production is directed and produced by students – Annette Prieto and Mirella Leyva, respectively – and features 22 student actors.

The monologues dive into the mystery, humor, pain, power, wisdom, outrage and excitement buried in women’s experiences. They address issues such as rape, birth, sex and relationships; some are serious, some are funny, all are enlightening and explore new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.

Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine's Day. The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about violence against women. The proceeds will be donated to the Monterey Rape Crisis Center and Dorothy’s Kitchen.

Parents, please note the mature content and graphic language used in the play.
