<p>SEASIDE Calif., Mar. 15, 2018 â€“ Nearly 100 Monterey County middle and high school students participated in the <a href="http://polar-ice.org/educator-resources/polar-srs/">Student Polar Research Symposium</a> Thursday, March 15, 2018 at the CSUMB <a href="https://csumb.edu/directory/buildings/university-center">University Center Ballroom</a>.</p><p>The symposium is a culmination of the National Science Foundation-funded (NSF) Polar Interdisciplinary Coordinate Education (Polar-ICE) Science Investigations Project designed to connect scientists, educators and students using data from the Arctic and Antarctic regions.</p><p>Local Monterey County schools in attendance included San Antonio Elementary School and Chalone Peaks Middle School. Teachers from aforementioned schools began preparing for this project last summer with a week-long workshop at The Ohio State University. Their students then prepared scientific-style project proposals before conducting their own investigations using authentic polar data this past January.</p><p>The top groups presented their findings to a panel of scientific personnel from seven scientific institutions including the Naval Postgraduate School, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University.</p><p>This project was designed to help students experience and practice the skills of scientists: asking science questions, analyzing and interpreting data, and planning and implementing science investigations, which are all important objectives of the Next Generation Science Standards.</p>
