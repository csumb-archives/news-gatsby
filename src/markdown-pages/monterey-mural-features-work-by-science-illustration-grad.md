<p>A mural by Stephanie Rozzo is now helping visitors to Monterey understand what the city’s natural landscape looked like over 400 years ago.</p><p>A 2011 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay’s <a href="http://scienceillustration.org/">science illustration program</a>, Rozzo was commissioned to create a 12&#45;foot by 5&#45;foot mural that was unveiled recently between Old Fisherman’s Wharf and Fisherman’s Shoreline Park on the city’s recreation trail.
</p><p>The centerpiece of the mural is a Coast Live Oak tree. The massive tree provided shelter and a navigational beacon for native people, Spanish explorers and seafaring merchants, according to a news release from the city. Landing ceremonies were held under the oak to celebrate the discovery of Monterey Bay in 1602, and the founding of the Presidio in 1770.
</p><p>In the mural, the oak is surrounded by native flora and fauna and Junipero Creek, which emptied into the bay.
</p><p><a href="http://www.stephanierozzo.com/">Rozzo</a> is a portrait and scientific illustrator who specializes in plants, animals, people and geology. Her work has been featured in museums, textbooks and other publications including National Geographic magazine.
</p><p>She studied native plants and trees to get the proper view of what the area looked like four centuries ago.“I researched everything I could and tried to make it as accurate as possible,”she told the Monterey Herald. “It was a little idealized, but I think that adds to it and makes it a little more fun.”
