<p>How could bringing home CSU Monterey Bayâ€™s first NCAA Division II national championship not be the No. 1 Most Memorable Moment in 2010-11? A six-tournament victory streak capped by a national title brought the spotlight of the collegiate golf world to Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Winning a national championship requires a team effort, yet the top moment in 2010-11 Otter Athletics as voted on by the fans recognized a tremendous individual accomplishment, which sparked the team to victory. Sophomore Dylan Jackson hit two huge shots on the back nine that proved instrumental in his individual victory over Lynn University's Roberto Francioni
</p><p>First, Jackson aced the 178-yard 13th hole. He then had the Otter fans watching online hold their collective breath as he sunk a 30-foot putt on 18 to tie the team score at 2. His older brother, John Johnson, then stepped up and clinched the title a few moments later.
</p><p>The championship, CSUMB's first NCAA title, was a fitting end to the finest overall season in Otter athletics history. Otter fans can hope that their most memorable moment from last season will proved to be a jumping-off point to bigger and better things in 2011-12.
