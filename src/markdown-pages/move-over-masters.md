</p><p><strong>CSUMB to compete in national disc golf championship</strong>
</p><p>While the world tuned in to see Tiger Woods' return to golf at The Masters tournament at Augusta National, the disc golf community prepared for its national collegiate championship this week, in North Augusta.
</p><p>Several hundred disc golfers representing approximately 40 colleges and universities will compete in the fourth annual Collegiate Disc Golf Championships April 15-18. CSU Monterey Bay earned a spot in the field by virtue of its victory in last November's West Coast College Open, held on the university's Cypress and Oaks courses. The Otters go in as the No. 8 seed. Unlike the contestants at that better known event in Georgia, the college golfers – playing on a course about five minutes away, although it's located in South Carolina – don't chase little white balls. These golfers take to the air. Like regular golfers, the players will hike around the 18-hole course carrying drivers and putters. But instead of clubs made of graphite, they use discs made of durable plastic. Scoring in disc golf is similar to regular or, as the players say, "ball" golf. Players get a certain number of strokes, or tosses, to hit the target – in disc golf, a basket. Eight CSUMB players will make the trip to North Augusta: club president Nick Mafei, team captains Danny McQuillian and James Lustenader, Greg Thomaschevski, Kenny Allison, AJ Wecker, Danny Messina and Tyler McBrian. Coach Merle Witvoet will not be able to accompany the team.
</p><p>The sport is growing in the college ranks. The first national championship drew a field of six teams. The second year, 12 teams competed. Seventeen teams entered last year and 40 are expected this year.
</p><p>The national team championship will be decided at the tourney, as well as singles and doubles titles. The top six individual finishers will earn "All American" honors.
</p><p>"We beat the University of Oregon at the West Coast Open," said Lustenader, "and they placed eighth in last year's national championship. And last year's singles champion is rated a 930 on the Professional Disc Golf Association scale.
</p><p>"Because multiple Otters have ratings higher than that, we feel we stand a good chance of bringing home a national title," Lustenader said.
