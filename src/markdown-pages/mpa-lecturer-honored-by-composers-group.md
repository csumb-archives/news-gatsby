</p><p>Dr. Sammons, a composer and guitarist, teaches analogue mixing and digital editing as well as the MPA capstone class and master classes. His music explores ideas such as audience interactivity, improvisation, the intersection of popular and classical music, and the pairing of electronic and acoustic sound.

</p><p>He earned a bachelor’s degree from Columbia University and a master’s and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia.
</p><p>His research interests include composition and audience-interactive music, the relationship between play and composition, new music for the guitar, and the intersection and overlap between "popular" music and "art" music.
