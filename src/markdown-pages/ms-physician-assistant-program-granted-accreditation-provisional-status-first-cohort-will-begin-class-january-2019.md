  SEASIDE, Ca., August 3, 2018 – California State University, Monterey Bay’s
  (CSUMB) Master of Science Physician Assistant (MSPA) program has been granted
  Accreditation-Provisional status by the Accreditation Review Commission on
  Education for The Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA). The MSPA program, which
  is approved for a class size of up to 33 students for the first three years,
  was also granted final approval by the WASC Senior College and University
  Commission as of July 25, 2018, officially clearing the program to begin
  January 7, 2019.
</p>
<p>
  “The MSPA is a significant addition to our portfolio of programs serving the
  tri-county region. We are thrilled to be starting this new program, and
  exceedingly grateful for all the support we have received from our local
  community, especially our excellent health care providers,” said CSUMB Provost
  and Vice President for Academic Affairs, Bonnie Irwin.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s 28-month <a href="https://csumb.edu/mspa">MSPA program</a> is the
  first program of its type in the California State University (CSU) system and
  aims to help address the urgent need for more primary-care health providers
  throughout Central California.
</p>
<p>
  The launch of the MSPA program at CSUMB was made possible by support from the
  following private and public entities: Central California Alliance for Health,
  Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula/Montage Health, Cypress
  Healthcare Partners, Doctors on Duty, George L. Mee Memorial Hospital, Mission
  Center Healthcare, Natividad Medical Center, Pinnacle HealthCare, Salinas
  Valley Memorial Hospital and Dignity Health, a California nonprofit public
  benefit corporation d/b/a Dominican Hospital.
</p>
<p>
  The ARC-PA has granted Accreditation-Provisional status to the California
  State University, Monterey Bay Physician Assistant Program sponsored by
  California State University, Monterey Bay.
</p>
<p>
  Accreditation-Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans
  and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed
  program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program’s
  ability to meet the ARC-PA Standards or when a program holding
  Accreditation-Provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in
  complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first
  class (cohort) of students.
</p>
<p>
  Accreditation-Provisional does not ensure any subsequent accreditation status.
  It is limited to no more than five years from matriculation of the first
  class.
</p>
<p>
  The ARC-PA noted zero (0) observations and zero (0) areas of noncompliance
  with
  <a href="https://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation/standards-of-accreditation/"
    >the standards</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  “This [zero areas of noncompliance] is an uncommon rating for new programs so
  we are confident that this rating speaks to the quality of the program,” said
  MSPA Founding Program Director and Professor, Christopher Forest. “The program
  currently has five full-time core faculty, most of whom have over 10 years’
  experience each in PA education. The curriculum has been established and
  clinical sites secured. The faculty are currently interviewing prospective
  students for the first class and excited for them to begin this new journey.”
