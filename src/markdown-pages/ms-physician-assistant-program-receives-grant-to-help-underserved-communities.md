    >Master of Science Physician Assistant Program</a
  >
  (MSPA) has received a grant from California’s Office of Statewide Health
  Planning and Development’s (OSHPD) Song-Brown Healthcare Workforce Development
  Training Program. The grant, totaling $72,000, will provide funding to the
  MSPA program to provide clinical training and education to PA students to
  prepare them to provide medical care to patients in underserved communities.
</p>
<p>
  "We are honored to receive this grant. With 56% of our students being from
  underserved backgrounds, these funds will provide additional resources for
  their education, create new rural clinical experiences, and enable us to more
  effectively attract applicants from underserved communities in the tri-county
  area,” said MSPA founding program director, Christopher Forest.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s 28-month <a href="%22https:">MSPA program</a> is the first program of
  its type in the California State University (CSU) system and aims to help
  address the urgent need for more primary-care health providers on California’s
  Central Coast.
</p>
<p>
  “The primary strategic goal of our college is to serve as the health sciences
  and human services workforce training hub for the central coast. Our MSPA
  Program provides a solution to the primary care provider shortage and we are
  thrilled to see our first cohort begin their clinical rotations in January,”
  said CSUMB College of Health Services and Human Sciences (CHSHS) Dean, Britt
  Rios-Ellis. “As the first of its kind in the CSU system, the MSPA program is
  just one example of the cutting-edge potential of CSUMB to serve the needs of
  our region.”
