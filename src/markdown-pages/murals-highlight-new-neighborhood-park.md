<p>Students in Professor Johanna Poethig’s painting and mural class at Cal State Monterey Bay are helping to brighten a park and learning valuable lessons in the process.
</p><p>They are creating a series of murals that will cover a 300-foot wall at the new Pajaro Neighborhood Park – a 4.9-acre parcel in the largely farm worker community that straddles Monterey and Santa Cruz counties.
</p><p>CSUMB students are creating nine of the 14 murals; local artist and muralist Jose Ortiz is working on the other five. Children from local schools are also contributing their talents to the effort.
</p><p>The youngsters’ paintings are given an artistic touch by the university’s art students, and then the images are incorporated into panels that are placed on the walls.
</p><p>According to Professor Poethig, the project will take two or three semesters.
</p><p>Students in CSUMB’s <a href="http://vpa.csumb.edu">Visual and Public Art Department</a> see the project as a chance to hone their skills.
</p><p>On their tumblr page, the students say the wall is “a great opportunity for public art design, large-scale painting, student learning and professional development, community improvisation, social practice and shared space.”
</p><p>The park will include a soccer field; gazebo; bandstand; basketball court; an asphalt running/walking track; children’s play areas; picnic areas and a parking lot.
</p><p>The Arts Council for Monterey County is sponsoring the project.
