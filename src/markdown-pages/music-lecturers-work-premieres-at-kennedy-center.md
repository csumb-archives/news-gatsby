</p><p>“Without question, the D.C. Youth Orchestra changed my life,” Wineglass said.
</p><p>When the youth orchestra asked him to compose a piece for its 50th anniversary celebration at the Kennedy Center in August, he seized the opportunity. Despite the short notice – he had only two months to work on the five-minute piece – he was eager to contribute to the program.
</p><p>A concert review in the Washington Post singled Wineglass out for praise.
</p><p>According to the Post's music critic, Cecelia Porter, the conductor “drew from the group iridescent colors in the premiere of a beautifully crafted suite by DCYO alumnus John Wineglass.”
</p><p>The composer was also the featured violinist for the piece, one of 110 alumni orchestra members who performed that night.
</p><p>Wineglass’ passion for music has also led him to develop proficiency as a contemporary jazz and gospel pianist. He serves as music director for Shoreline Community Church.
