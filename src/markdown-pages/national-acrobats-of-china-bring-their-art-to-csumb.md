<h3></h3><h3>World Theater season opens with Sept. 17 performance</h3><p>Acrobatics is an ancient art form in China. Centuries ago, performers combined dramatic folk arts and variety shows with the cultural roots of their civilization, and using common objects as stage props, created an acrobatic art unique to their culture.
</p><p>The National Acrobats of the People’s Republic of China continue this ancient tradition. The troupe’s gymnasts, jugglers, cyclists and tumblers combine drama, ballet and magic to make contemporary performances every bit as thrilling and entertaining as they were 3,000 years ago.
</p><p>Local audiences will have the opportunity to see the 35 performers execute daring feats with tables, chairs, flags and plates when the troupe visits CSU Monterey Bay’s World Theater at 7:30 p.m., Sept. 17 as the 2014-15 Performing Arts Series gets under way. The Beijing-based company tours annually around the globe and has performed in more than 40 countries. The performance promises to be a wonderful event for the entire family.
</p><p>"I have immense respect for all the acrobats and performers in this show,” said Joe Cardinalli, artistic and executive director at the World Theater. “They are amazing. Come to the theater and be part of the magic."
