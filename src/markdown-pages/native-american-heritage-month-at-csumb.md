</p><p>CSUMB Professor George Baldwin will present “Digital Reservations: Songs and Stories About Growing Up Indian” at 7 p.m., Nov. 6. In this entertaining presentation, Dr. Baldwin (pictured at right) incorporates traditional native storytelling and original songs to offer a rare glimpse into contemporary Native identity. Growing up on several Indian reservations – not his own – Baldwin offers a humorous look at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the small government-funded communities that served the tribes during the 1960s.
</p><p>His social commentary spans 55 years of federal policy and the cultural change that such polices fostered on our country’s Indian reservations. Dr. Baldwin is a recognized member of the Osage and Kansa tribes of Oklahoma. He has worked for dozens of Native tribes as a social activist, promoting self-determination through tribal reorganization, integration of new technologies, and education. He is a founding faculty member at CSUMB and a professor in the Social, Behavioral, and Global Studies Division.

</p><p><em>Our Native culture is like a delicate weaving, with each strand representing a part of our world. The flute is just one of those strands. If you cut just one strand, over time you will lose the entire weaving, so I strive to keep this part of our Native culture alive, evolving, and intact. I wish to share it with the world. </em> – David Wolfs Robe<em>.</em>
