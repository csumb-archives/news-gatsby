<p>Of the 7,100 students enrolled at Cal State Monterey Bay last fall, fewer than 1 percent identified themselves as Native American.
</p><p>With support from Dr. Browning Neddeau, a professor in the Liberal Studies Department, some of those students have organized Native American Students United &#40;NASU&#41;. Dr. Neddeau and Mark Alabanza, assistant director for academic personnel, are club advisers. The group meets monthly and is open to Native American students, faculty and staff.
</p><p>NASU has invited a group of students from McKinleyville High School in Humboldt County to visit campus on April 11. “To my knowledge, this is the first time that CSUMB has hosted a Native high school student club visit,” Dr. Neddeau said.
</p><p>“Our CSUMB Native students and potentially faculty and staff will help with the tours and talking circle at the end of the day,” he said.
</p><p>The club meets the third Tuesday of the month, from 6 to 7 p.m., in Bldg. 2, Room 111.
</p><p>A Native Advisory Council &#40;NAC&#41; has also been formed, with 16 students, staff, faculty and community members.
</p><p>NAC serves three purposes:
</p><p>As word spreads about NAC, the number of active participants is expected to grow. The current outreach efforts include connecting with various tribes that represent CSUMB students.
</p><p>Both the club and the advisory council are supported by the Office of Inclusive Excellence.
