<p>Kathryn England&#45;Aytes, a lecturer in psychology, has joined a newly created national organization that serves the needs of children.
</p><p><a href="http://sbgs.csumb.edu/faculty/kathryn&#45;england&#45;aytes">Dr. England&#45;Aytes</a> will serve as a consultant with the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, an organization that provides information, resources and services relating to adoption, foster care and child welfare.
</p><p>Former Kinship Center CEO Carol Biddle is the managing director; Adam Pertman, former president of the Donaldson Adoption Institute, is the founder and president.
</p><p>Her work with the center “fits into my own research interests on historical trauma and links with contemporary behavior, particularly in educational settings, in Indian Country,” she said.
</p><p>“I believe this will also be a good fit with my work with the Native American Children’s Alliance &#40;NACA&#41;, an inter&#45;tribal nonprofit that works on child abuse prevention and intervention.”
</p><p>As a board member and trainer for NACA, she has given presentations on child forensic interviewing and cultural awareness in multidisciplinary team settings.
</p><p>“As a Native educator, my goal is always to honor and integrate the cultures, values and traditions of Native students with learning opportunities for full participation in the larger community,” she said.
</p><p>In December, Dr. England&#45;Aytes made a presentation at the National Indian Nations Conference: Justice for Victims of Crime, held on the Agua Caliente reservation in Southern California. Along with co&#45;presenters from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the South Dakota Highway Patrol and the National Children’s Alliance, she talked on “Building Resiliency in Child Abuse Organizations Working with Native Children.”
</p><p>And good reviews continue to be published about the book “Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education” by Four Arrows, to which Dr. England&#45;Aytes contributed a chapter.
</p><p>According to a review in Education Review/Reseñas Educativas, her chapter on historical trauma and its prevention in the classroom established the first and most critical part of the book.
