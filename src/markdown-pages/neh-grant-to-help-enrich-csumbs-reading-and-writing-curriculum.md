  SEASIDE, Ca., February 15, 2019 – California State University, Monterey Bay
  (CSUMB’s)
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/cad">Communication Across the Disciplines</a>
  program has been awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant
  that will help improve reading and writing instruction across all majors at
  CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  The grant, totaling $99,441 and awarded under NEH’s Humanities Initiatives at
  Hispanic-Serving Institutions category, will help fund a three-year project
  entitled “Improving Learning and Achievement with Reading/Writing-Enriched
  Curriculum (RWEC) in the Disciplines.”
</p>
<p>
  The project will initiate a sustainable program of systematic reflection and
  improvement of reading and writing instruction across all majors at CSUMB
  while extending work currently in progress within lower-division general
  education requirements. Furthermore, the project will expand faculty
  development on reading and writing instruction and include all faculty, in all
  disciplines, and all levels of instruction.
</p>
<p>
  “We all continue to learn to read and write as we encounter and have to
  produce new kinds of texts in new situations,” said Communications Across the
  Disciplines associate professor, Nelson Graff. “This project supports faculty
  in the disciplines as they reflect on what skilled reading and writing look
  like in their majors and professions, then scaffold instruction across their
  majors to help students develop those skills.”
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this infusion is that students reach their senior capstone
  experience with the reading, writing, and critical thinking skills necessary
  to succeed in completing those research and writing-intensive projects.
</p>
<p>
  The NEH announced a total of $14.8 million in grants in December of 2018 that
  will support 253 humanities projects across the nation in 44 states, the
  District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
