<p>Dr. Umi Vaughan, assistant professor of Africana Studies in CSUMB’s Division of Humanities and Communication, has co-authored a book with Carlos Aldama. In it, the master and student trace the history of batá drumming from Arica to Cuba to the United States.
</p><p>Batá identifies both the two-headed, hourglass-shaped drum of the Yoruba people and the culture and style of drumming, singing and dancing associated with it. Aldama is one of the masters of the batá drum. The book, “Carlos Aldama’s Life in Batá: Cuba, Diaspora, and the Drum,” recounts his life story and traces the history of batá culture on its trek from Africa to Cuba and then to the United States.
</p><p>For the enslaved Yoruba, batá rhythms helped sustain the religious and cultural practices of a people who had been torn from their roots. Aldama, as guardian of Afro-Cuban music and as a Santería priest, maintains the link with this tradition. By sharing his stories, Aldama and his student Dr. Vaughan bring to light the techniques and principles of batá in all its aspects, documenting the tensions of maintaining a tradition between generations and worlds, old and new.
</p><p>The book includes rare photographs and access to downloadable audio tracks.
</p><p>Aldama is omo Añá (sworn to the drum) and a priest of Changó in the Santería religion. Born in Havana, he was a founding member of Conjunto Folklórico Nacional de Cuba, studying under its original musical director, Jesus Pérez (Oba Ilu), and later serving as musical director himself. He has worked with the National Symphony of Cuba, playwright Roberto Blanco, and Karl Marx Theatre director Alex Valdez, and has performed with Adalberto Alvarez y su Son, Lazaro Ros and Olorún, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba.
</p><p>Dr. Vaughan is also omo Añá and is a priest of Ochun in the Santería religion. He is an artist and anthropologist who explores dance, creates photographs and performances, and publishes about African Diaspora culture. He is the author of “Rebel Dance, Renegade Stance: Timba Music and Black Identity in Cuba.” Visit his website <a href="http://www.umiart.com.">here</a>.
