<p>Although Darcy Milligan only started as CSU Monterey Bay's women's golf coach a few weeks ago, she is a familiar face at the Otters' home courses of Bayonet and Black Horse. Not only is Milligan an assistant golf professional at the courses, she played for the Otters from 2007 to 2011. â€“* Monterey Herald*, Oct. 23, 2014
