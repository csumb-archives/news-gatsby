<p>From the perspective of Eduardo Ochoa, incoming interim president of CSU Monterey Bay, the small campus has huge potential to become a national leader. The university was established in 1995, a time when measuring "learning outcomes" was becoming the norm in higher education. CSUMB developed the curriculum incorporating a way to measure knowledge acquired, a topic much talked about in higher education these days. â€“ <em>Long Beach Press-Telegram</em>, Aug, 6, 2012
