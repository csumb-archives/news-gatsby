<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s College of Education has announced a new Human Development and Family Studies (HDFS) undergraduate degree program, scheduled to begin in fall 2016.</p><p>The HDFS bachelor of arts program will teach students about human growth and change through all stages of life, focusing on how families develop and grow in specific contexts and environments. Students will learn about the diversity of families and how culture and community can define appropriate practices across the lifespan.
</p><p>That approach, evaluating how those factors define developmental practices, is what makes this program unique, according to Deanne Perez&#45;Granados, department chair and associate professor in the Liberal Studies department. It’s particularly valuable for teachers.
</p><p>“The HDFS program is excellent preparation for students pursuing careers in early childhood education, covering transitional kindergarten, kindergarten and first grade, and will offer community Head Start teachers an academic pathway to a B.A. degree, meeting federal and state mandates for education and training of early care and education professionals. The program also prepares professionals in adult education, health education, parent education, and post&#45;secondary education,” she said.
</p><p>Teaching and education aren’t the only professions that could be potential career paths for HDFS graduates. Social work and counseling are other options, along with non&#45;profit and health, or careers in business and research. Regardless, students will be well prepared. The HDFS program includes course work, fieldwork, service learning, and a capstone project.
</p><p>“Given the high demand for professionals in these critical areas,we expect our new HDFS major to grow and thrive in the coming years,” Perez&#45;Granados said. “The HDFS program at CSUMB is timely; it fills needs from the academic campus and community workforce.”
