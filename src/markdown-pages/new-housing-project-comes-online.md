<p>THE PROMONTORY READY FOR STUDENTS </p><p>“We can’t wait for students to fill these buildings with life,” CSU Monterey Bay President Eduardo Ochoa said at the July 23 ribbon&#45;cutting for the Promontory, a housing complex north of campus.
</p><p>The three buildings can accommodate a total of 579 students in 174 two&#45;, three&#45; and four&#45;bedroom suites. Each suite has a common kitchen and living room; each bedroom has a private bathroom.

Amenities include a two&#45;level fitness center, a game room with pool table, study rooms, a cyber café with kitchen, and a theater, all located in the center building. Each building has an interior courtyard.

Several speakers at the ribbon&#45;cutting commented on the innovative nature of the project, which involved the city of Marina, the university, and AMCAL, the private developer.

The privately funded project was built to LEED silver standards.
