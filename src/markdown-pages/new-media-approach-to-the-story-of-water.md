<p>Enid Baxter Blader is the co-editor of a series of 22 contemporary projects that explore California and its troubled relationship with water.
</p><p>Water, CA is a multimedia “experiment in geography” that helps visitors to its website understand the complex story of water in the Golden State through essays, paintings, photography, video animations and a water timeline.
</p><p>Blader, chair of the Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology, and her co-editor, artist Nicole Antebi, say the projects create a new way of navigating California’s landscape. Erasing the traditional map, tied together by counties and towns, the state can be drawn by waterways, watersheds, reclamations, deprivations . . .  connecting seemingly disparate bodies.
</p><p>Blader wrote and illustrated two of the entries, one examining the Central Valley and discussing the cultural divide at the heart of the battle over California’s water, the other looking at the history of the Salinas River.
</p><p>Visit the site at <a href="http://www.watercalifornia.org/">www.watercalifornia.org</a>, or see it on display in the fall of 2011 at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento.
