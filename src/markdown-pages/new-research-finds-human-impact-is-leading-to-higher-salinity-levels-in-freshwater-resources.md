  <b>SEASIDE, Ca., December 14, 2018 –</b> A study conducted by California State
  University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB)
  <a href="/sns">School of Natural Sciences</a> assistant professor John Olson
  has found that the combined effects of land use and climate change are
  resulting in increased salinity levels in rivers and streams, further
  highlighting an emerging threat to freshwater resources, biodiversity and
  ecosystem functions across the United States.
</p>
<p>
  Increase in human land use such as agricultural, industrial and urban
  development are primary contributing factors to increasing salt levels, with
  climate change accounting for 12 percent of the increase.
</p>
<p>
  Olson estimated that at least one third of U.S. streams and rivers have gotten
  saltier over the last 100 years and predicted that salinization levels may
  rise by 50 percent in half of U.S. streams by the year 2100. While increased
  salinity levels pose a problem for drinking water, they may also double the
  amount of streams that are too salty for irrigation from 3 to 6 percent,
  compounding losses of water resource availability caused by increasing
  droughts and other climate change effects.
</p>
<p>
  The effects of increased salinity levels are not limited to salt’s effects on
  humans. The research also predicts that increased salinity levels will stress
  biota within the ecosystem resulting in losses of an additional 42 percent of
  the habitat by 2100.
