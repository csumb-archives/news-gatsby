<p>Madison Heard applied for a spot in the CSU Monterey Bay-based ocean science summer program as a way to “test the waters of research” for a possible career.</p><p>Consider the test a success.

“After only a few weeks at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, I am positive I want to continue on this path,” she said.

Heard is one of 11 students – she and Catrin Wendt are the only ones from CSUMB – in the 10&#45;week Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates program funded by the National Science Foundation. This is the second year of a three&#45;year grant.

By the end of the summer, the students will have completed an independent research project under the supervision of a mentor. They will go through the customary steps of scientific research: formulating a thesis, writing a proposal, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting their findings. They also attend professional development workshops and learn skills such as basic GIS.
</p><p>There’s also time for social events, such as kayaking trips to Elkhorn Slough, barbecues on the beach and a visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
</p><p>Students can choose to work with mentors from CSUMB, the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Hopkins Marine Station, MBARI, Moss Landing Marine Labs and the Naval Postgraduate School.
</p><p>MBARI is a great fit for Heard. “It’s like the NASA of marine science,” she said.
</p><p>Her project involves studying the impacts of ocean acidification on abalone.
</p><p>Halfway through the summer, what has she gotten out of the experience?
</p><p>“ . . . Too many things to count,” she said. “From networking to friendships to having amazing opportunities to go out on the R/V Rachel Carson. . . everything I have done this summer has shaped me into a more confident researcher.
</p><p>“This experience has been nothing short of life changing, and I am excited to take what I’ve learned and apply it to my path as a marine scientist.”
