<h3>Lysley Tenorio visits campus April 8 as part of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month</h3><p>Short-story writer Lysley Tenorio will read from his work April 8 at CSU Monterey Bay. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Tenorio is the author of <em>Monstress</em>, which binds together eight tales of isolated misfits in San Francisco and the Philippines. They have been described as “tender” and “quirky,” written from the point of view of charlatans, B movie starlets, superhero obsessives and transgender cocktail waitresses.
</p><p>NPR said of the stories: “Filipino traditions meet Californian modernity again and again, each encounter revealing something unexpected about both cultures.”
</p><p>The roots of Tenorio's tales are buried in his family's decision to immigrate to California when he was 7 months old. He grew up in a home eager to assimilate.
</p><p>His stories have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine and <em>The Best New American Voices</em> and Pushcart Prize anthologies. A Whiting Writer's Award winner and a former Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, he has received fellowships from the University of Wisconsin and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</p><p>Tenorio lives in San Francisco and is an associate professor at Saint Mary’s College of California.
</p><p>The event will be held at 7 p.m. in the University Center living room, located on Sixth Avenue and B Street. While the reading is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>. 
</p><p>Tenorio’s appearance is part of CSUMB’s celebration of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month and is part of a series of readings called Writers from the Edge. In March, poet Aimee Suzara read from her first full-length collection, <em>Souvenir</em>. The series started in February with a reading by novelist Keenan Norris.
</p><p>For more information, contact Professor Ernest Stromberg at 582-3114.
</p><p>The reading is sponsored by the Division of Humanities and Communication; the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; Student Activities and Leadership Development; Asian Pacific Islander Association; and the Office of Inclusive Excellence.
</p><p><em>Tenorio…has taken a uniquely Filipino-American perspective, polyglot and glittering with cinema dreams, and used it to make a bold collection of stories of the rejected, the helpless and the lost. Monstress is the debut of a singular talent.</em> ?– NPR
</p><p>*. . . refreshingly off-kilter…his stories are impeccably constructed, leading us calmly but insistently through the characters’ external and internal landscapes.* ?– The New York Times Book Review
