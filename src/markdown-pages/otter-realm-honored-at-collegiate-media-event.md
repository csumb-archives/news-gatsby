<p>Paper earns 10 awards – including a trio of firsts</p><p>For the second straight year, the <a href="http://otterrealm.com/wp&#45;content/uploads/2015/09/spring2015ROMP.pdf">Otter Romp</a>, a year&#45;end issue of the Otter Realm that features investigative reporting, was named best special section at the California College Media Association’s annual Excellence in Student Media Awards ceremony on Feb. 20.
</p><p>It was one of nine awards – and three first&#45;place honors – earned by CSU Monterey Bay’s student newspaper and presented at the annual college journalism conference.  Members of the paper’s staff, along with faculty advisers Estella Porras and Sam Robinson, attended the conference and awards ceremony at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Los Angeles.

Taking first place for best non&#45;breaking news story was the team of Danny Simon, Katie Kishiand Stefan Farhner, whose story headlined “<a href="http://02b9ba5eb526d198453b&#45;c8e947d35177b661dc86119dcf7bad6d.r29.cf2.rackcdn.com/109468114056609e52654d0_0.pdf">CSUMB tries to tighten spigots on East Campus, but water district still wants the cash to flow</a>” appeared in the Otter Romp. The contest judge referred to the reporters’ “deep and dogged investigative work.
</p><p>“They took what would seem a mind&#45;numbing topic – campus water costs – and uncovered a fascinating story of how the local water district had been over&#45;charging the university for years. . . The reporters show a talent for investigative reporting and the persistence and patience it requires,” the judge said.
</p><p>Achelle Reynoso, beat reporter for the College of Science, won first place in the best headlines competition.
</p><p>While CSUMB competes in the less&#45;than&#45;weekly category, the Otter Realm showed that it can hold its own with the large schools by taking second place in the podcast category – where it was up against schools of all sizes and publication schedules.
</p><p>The award went to Raquelle Miller and Porras for the podcast, “<a href="http://otterrealm.com/podcast&#45;tired&#45;very&#45;tired/">Tired, Very Tired</a>.” The judge described it as a “compelling first&#45;person piece, especially as it rolls out the details of this very busy student’s life. . . I loved the determination and hope in this commentary.”
</p><p>The high quality of coverage and design was also recognized by the Associated Collegiate Press as the Otter Realm won third place in the Best of Show competition.
