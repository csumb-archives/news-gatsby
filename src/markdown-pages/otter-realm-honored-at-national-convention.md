<p>The Otter Realm, CSU Monterey Bay’s student newspaper, was honored at the National College Journalism Convention held recently in Seattle.
</p><p>The Associated Collegiate Press, the largest and oldest national organization for college student media in the U.S., sponsored the convention.
</p><p>The Otter Realm competed in the Best of Show contest, which was judged on the basis of a single issue of the editor’s choice published this academic year. Competition was held for daily papers, weekly publications, and less-than-weekly papers – the Otter Realm’s category, where it earned a fourth-place award.
</p><p>The entries were judged for general excellence, which included the quality of the reporting, writing, editing, design, photography and examples of special-project reporting and editorial page leadership.
</p><p>The Observer from Fordham University in New York City took the top honor in the less-than-weekly category.
</p><p>“This award is a representation of the dedicated team of reporters, editors, photographers and designers who work on the paper,” said Crystal Lopez, this year’s editor-in-chief.
</p><p>The Otter Realm is published the first and third Thursday during the school year. It also operates a <a href="http://OtterRealm.net">website</a> where news stories are posted on a regular basis. Students in Human Communication 389, Otter Realm Workshop, produce both.
</p><p>Professor Estella Porras is the faculty adviser.
