<p>The quest to win a national championship at CSUMB is over. Senior John Jackson carded a key birdie on the 16th to win, D.J. Milligan won by strokes and sophomore Dylan Jackson dramatically sank a 3-foot putt on the 18th for another victory, leading the Otters to a 3-2 win over No. 1 Lynn University in the finals of the NCAA Division II Championship at The Shoal Course in Alabama. â€“ Monterey Herald, May 21, 2011
