<p>The university's outdoor emergency notification system will be tested today at approximately 11:50 a.m.
</p><p>During the test, the system will broadcast a tone, followed by a voice message over speakers located around campus. The alert tones are loud and distinct and should be easily heard by anyone who is outdoors on the main campus.
</p><p>Like all of the university's emergency communication tools, the outdoor notification system is tested on a regular basis – the forth Friday of each month – to ensure it is working properly and to help familiarize the campus community with how it will operate in an emergency.
</p><p>Other emergency communication methods the university has in place include Otter Alert text messages, emergency messaging via the web, e&#45;mail distribution, and a telephone hotline featuring a recorded message at 582&#45;5044.
