<h4>Gift to help with library construction</h4><p>President Dianne F. Harrison has announced a $1 million grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for the construction of the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.
</p><p>"This leadership gift is a major vote of confidence in the university," said Dr. Harrison. "It represents the Foundation's deep commitment toward student success, and it sends a strong message to our community about the importance of private support for the library."
</p><p>Don Chapin, chair of CSUMB's President's Council, emphasized the importance of this gift to the region.
</p><p>"The Packard Foundation's gift is key to assuring the finest education for our children, grandchildren and beyond," said Mr. Chapin, a regional business leader. "Its investment in the Tanimura &amp; Antle library reminds us of how vital it is that all of our communities- university, friends, parents, alumni and students - come together to support this crucial building campaign."
</p><p>With its stunning architecture, soaring atrium providing natural light, and views to Monterey and the Salinas Valley, the library will be the defining facility on campus, and a regional landmark. In addition to its beautiful design and functionality, the building will include a range of sustainable design features, including an innovative climate control system that is expected to result in the use of 28 percent less energy than California's latest energy code requires.
</p><p>Anyone wishing to take a student-led tour of the library site can arrange it by calling Steve Weldon, director of Planned Giving, at 582-3070.
</p><p>The Packard Foundation has been providing key financial support to the university since CSUMB's first years. It was created in 1964 by David Packard, the co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company, and Lucile Salter Packard. Throughout their lives in business and philanthropy, the Packards sought to use private funds for the public good, giving back to a society that enabled them to prosper.
</p><p>The Packard gift is a second major gift the university has received recently. In October, Dr. Harrison announced that the late Marian K. Krause, through her charitable trust and estate, left the university $4 million to be used for scholarships.
