</p><p>Have a question about financial aid? Here's an opportunity to get it answered.
</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, local television station KION-46 will assemble a panel of financial aid experts from local schools, including two from CSU Monterey Bay, to take questions from viewers.
</p><p>The panel members will answer questions called into the station between 5 and 6:30 p.m. The answers won't be broadcast; each caller will have a personal conversation directly with a financial aid adviser. The phone number will be displayed on the TV screen during the newscast.
</p><p>KION is located on channel 5 on Comcast as well as the CSUMB cable system.
