<h3>University holds summer orientation sessions</h3><p>A generation ago, college orientation was a perfunctory event, focusing on getting the new students registered for classes.
</p><p>Now, universities, including CSU Monterey Bay, have made this annual ritual an important part of the student experience, and include a separate program for parents.
</p><p>Otter orientation sessions are being held in June, with events meant to showcase the campus to students who will enter in the fall. All six sessions – two for transfers, four for incoming freshmen – are at the maximum capacity of 200 students. The freshmen sessions also have had more than 300 family members in attendance.
</p><p>The sessions are designed to ensure a successful transition to CSUMB. Students have the opportunity to meet with an adviser, register for classes, and learn about the university and how to get involved with campus life. They are introduced to campus organizations, student government, living and learning opportunities, outdoor recreation and intramural sports. And they get information on academic services, such as tutoring and advising, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center.
</p><p>While students are learning about the various majors and student services, their parents and other family members have the opportunity to ask questions of a panel of campus representatives.
</p><p>Dr. Christine Erickson, dean of students, gave a short presentation called Parents as Partners: Together in Transition. She told the audience that the university treats students as adults, expects them to be responsible, accountable and capable, and to seek out and use the resources that are available to help them.
</p><p>“We need you to trust that we have your child’s best interests at heart,” Dr. Erickson said. And she reminded the audience that at CSUMB, “we really are committed to the success of each and every student.”
</p><p>Parents had questions about how their students could get a campus job (easily, using an online process), if skateboards are allowed on campus (yes), how housing assignments could be changed (only after the first two weeks, and only if space is available), and if cars are necessary (no, there’s good public transportation and car-pooling).
</p><p>New students will have the opportunity to make connections and get involved during Otter Days Aug. 19-21, and at the Club Showcase, which will be held in early September.
