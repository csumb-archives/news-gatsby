<p>Chaplain Clark Brown co-hosts a weekly drop-in conversation opportunity, called Chaplain Cafe, with Father Jon Perez, the Episcopal chaplain at CSUMB. They put a welcoming sign on a table at a coffee shop on campus; sometimes faculty members stop by and ask them to be guest speakers in their classes. More often students come to discuss problems in their lives: spiritual issues, financial pressures, relationship difficulties, family strife. â€“ <em>Morgan Hill Times</em>, March 14, 2012
