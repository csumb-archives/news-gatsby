<h3>Student-athletes toss in spare change for Make-A-Wish Foundation</h3><p>CSUMB’s Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) held its second annual Penny Wars throughout the school year, raising more than $1,500 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the official charity of NCAA Division II schools.
</p><p>Penny Wars was a competition among teams, but with a catch. Members of the university’s 12 teams (men’s and women’s cross country teams combined) earned points by depositing pennies in their teams’ jars.
</p><p>But, members of one team could sabotage another team by putting money other than pennies – like nickels, dimes and dollars – in their competition’s jars. The penny value of that money was subtracted from that team’s total.
</p><p>At the end of each week, the jars were collected and counted; the teams were updated with their standings as the school year progressed. The jars were at all CSUMB sporting events and in the Otter Athletic Office throughout the year.
</p><p>“This was a fun – and competitive – way to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation,” said SAAC President Carrie LaPonza, a senior math major. “This was a great way to get all our teams involved.”
</p><p>Women's basketball took top honors by raising $246.83; women's water polo and baseball were second and third, respectively.
