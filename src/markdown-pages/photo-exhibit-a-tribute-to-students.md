<p>“Archaeology on the Edge of Empire,” an exhibit of photographs by Professor Ruben Mendoza, is on display in the Student Center.</p><p>Dr. Mendoza calls the exhibit a “special tribute” to the many CSUMB students who, over two decades, have worked on projects sponsored by the archaeology program.
</p><p>“This tribute was organized to highlight some of the many contributions and discoveries made by our project teams since 1995,” he said.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza and his student teams have added to the archaeological, scientific and historical record of the Monterey Bay.  Discoveries include the earliest Serra Chapels at Monterey, 1770&#45;72; the neophyte plaza, soldiers’ quarters, baptistery and women’s quarters at Soledad, ca. 1800; the earliest chapel at Mission San Juan Bautista, 1797&#45;1802; and the solar geometry of the California missions.

The exhibit will be on display through May 13. It includes 45 color and black&#45;and&#45;white, 16&#45;inch by 20&#45;inch photos selected by students.

An archaeologist, photographer and scholar with 140 articles and books to his credit, Dr. Mendoza has generated a collection of 800,000 images pertaining to archaeology, historic preservation and service learning.
</p><p>The exhibit is sponsored by the Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies and the Special Events Funding Program.
