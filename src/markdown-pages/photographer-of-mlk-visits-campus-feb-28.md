<h3>Bob Fitch's image of Martin Luther King was model for monument</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s celebration of Black History Month continues on Feb. 28 with “My Eyes Have Seen: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Civil Rights Movement,” a presentation by photojournalist Bob Fitch.
</p><p>The presentation will start at 7 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue near B Street. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Fitch – who served as Dr. King’s photographer at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference – will present famous and rarely seen images of the Civil Rights icon.
</p><p>He trained to be an engineer, and then a Protestant minister. But, he says, “Photojournalism seduced me. It is a compelling combination of visual aesthetics, potent communication and story telling. It is a way to effectively support the organizing for social justice that is transforming our lives and future.” In 1966, he took what has become an iconic shot of Dr. King. The photograph served as the model for the Martin Luther King Monument in Washington, D.C. Taken in Atlanta, it captured Dr. King with his arms crossed, staring to his right. An illustration of Mahatma Gandhi hangs nearby.
</p><p>Another Fitch photo served as the model for the Cesar Chavez commemorative postage stamp. His work has been featured in two Smithsonian traveling exhibits and been reproduced globally in print, film, and electronic media.
</p><p>He has captured images of the farm worker movement, Dorothy Day and the Catholic Workers, and Joan Baez and the peace movement, as well as the Civil Rights movement. Visit his <a href="http://bobfitchphoto.com">website</a> to see some of his work.
</p><p>He lives in Watsonville and stays active in local political empowerment campaigns and non-violent campaigns for peace and justice.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by Student Activities &amp; Leadership Development at CSUMB, as part of its cultural enrichment series.
