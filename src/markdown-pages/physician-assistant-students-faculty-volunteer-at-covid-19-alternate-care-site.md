  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., May 15, 2020</b> - Students and faculty with CSU Monterey
  Bay’s Master of Physician Assistant (MSPA) Program continue to volunteer their
  time, energy and skills to fight COVID-19. They are now helping set up an
  Alternate Care Site (ACS) at Marina Airport.
</p>
<p>
  As part of local emergency preparations, Monterey County officials are
  readying the site for the potential influx of patients to local hospitals. The
  site is designated for COVID-19 positive patients who have a range of basic
  medical needs, but do not need hospitalization. These sites will not be open
  to the public, nor serve as walk-up medical facilities.
</p>
<p>
  “The four hospitals in Monterey County are cooperating to establish an
  Alternate Care Site that could accept patients with coronavirus, should area
  hospitals begin to approach their individual surge capacities,” said Craig
  Walls, chief medical officer of Natividad Medical Center. The private
  aerospace company Joby Aviation is also collaborating on the site preparation.
</p>
<p>
  "We are very proud of the physician assistant students and faculty who are
  dedicating their free time and weekends to collaborate with the leadership at
  Natividad Medical Center and the county, designing these alternate care
  facilities and filling the gaps where help is so desperately needed. It’s
  exciting to see everyone working together for a common goal," said Christopher
  Forest, MSPA program director.
</p>
<p>
  MSPA students have taken on a variety of volunteer roles, including supply
  coordination and logistics, volunteer outreach, and public communication.
  Michael Jorgensen, an MSPA faculty Instructor, has been working with Walls to
  ensure clinical operations run smoothly at the site. Both are members of the
  county’s Emergency Operations Center team.

  Jorgensen brings extensive disaster response experience. He served in the U.S.
  military as a Navy Corpsman, in addition to working in conflict zones globally
  with Doctors Without Borders.
</p>
<p>
  Physician assistant student Sara Adkison said Jorgensen’s “level of enthusiasm
  motivates others to go above and beyond.”
</p>
<p>
  “His dedication is not only an inspiration to us as students, but also serves
  as an example of the type of provider we all hope to become,” she said.

  More volunteers are needed to fill the healthcare and supportive roles at the
  Marina ACS. For information and to apply to become a volunteer, go online to
