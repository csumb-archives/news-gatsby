<p>Return of the Natives, the education and outreach arm of CSU Monterey Bay’s Watershed Institute, has a big idea for 2015. RON plans to transform parts of CSUMB’s Seaside campus into a living laboratory of learning and stewardship. It will invite the public to help plant up to 3,000 native plants – grown by students and volunteers from Gateway and Hope centers – on sites where former Army buildings have been demolished. The work, to be done during the rainy months of January, February and March, will help to create an inviting campus. The project is part of Monterey County Gives, a year&#45;end fundraising campaign that supports local non&#45;profit organizations. The six&#45;week campaign ends Dec. 31. <a href="https://www.montereycountygives.com/environment&#45;sustainability/return&#45;of&#45;the&#45;natives&#45;restoration&#45;education&#45;project/">Donations to support  Return of the Natives can be made online.</a>
</p><p>RON's environmental goal is to protect the waters of the Monterey Bay through restoration of the waterways and the lands draining in the bay. RON's social goal is to bring people and nature together on restoration and garden projects in the watersheds of the Monterey Bay. Over the past 20 years, more than 75,000 school children, 450 CSUMB students, 6,500 youth and 1,300 Monterey County families have worked with RON.
