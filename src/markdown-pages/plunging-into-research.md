<h3>Grant allows undergrads to get first-hand experience</h3><p>One of CSU Monterey Bay’s selling points is its proximity to the bay. Students enjoy the recreational activities associated with it; they can also work with faculty members and scientists on research projects tied to it. Those research opportunities have just expanded, thanks to a program funded by the National Science Foundation and based at CSUMB. As of this summer, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) in ocean science will be available to students from all over the country. 
</p><p>Dr. Corey Garza, a professor in CSUMB's Division of Science and Environmental Policy, is the program director.  The 10-week program will allow 11 students to get paid while working with faculty and scientists on campus and at the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing Marine Labs and the Naval Postgraduate School. The program will give students hands-on research experience in oceanography, marine biology and ecology, ocean engineering and marine geology. They will work closely with university professors and scientists, hear lectures by experts, collaborate on research and develop oral presentations based on their area of interest. The long-term goal is to train the next generation of professional scientists. CSUMB becomes one of only 32 ocean science REUs in the country – and the only one in the CSU system. Other sites include Duke University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. A stipend and help with travel and housing expenses will be provided. <a href="http://reu.csumb.edu">More information is available here.</a>
