</p><p>Professor Barbara Mossberg believes that poetry has the power to change the world. That conviction helped earn her the position of poet in residence for the city of Pacific Grove.
</p><p>She's the fourth person to occupy the position since it was created in 2002.
</p><p>In that capacity, she will help the city organize poetry-related community activities and events and hopes to involve the university. And she will live in the Poet's Perch, the historic home in downtown Pacific Grove, a half-block from the beach.
</p><p>The house was willed to the city by Whitney Latham-Lechich after her death in 1997. Latham-Lechich was a poet and educator, and wanted the house used to promote poetry in the city.
</p><p>"I've always been a poet," Dr. Mossberg said in accepting the position. "My job titles have been wonderful â€“ president, dean, professor, scholar in residence, senior fellow, Fulbright lecturer, each an incredible opportunity to serve.
</p><p>"But to have the title of poet in residence! This makes whole my various selves. Thank you, Pacific Grove."
</p><p>Dr. Mossberg, director of CSU Monterey Bay's Integrated Studies program, is a teacher, thespian, poet, environmentalist, lecturer and scholar. 
</p><p>Her academic achievements include a Ph.D. in literature and linguistics from Indiana University, several senior Fulbright awards and an appointment as the American Studies specialist for the U.S. State Department.
</p><p>She began her academic career teaching drama and literature at the University of Oregon. Later, her teaching career expanded to include an appointment as senior Fulbright distinguished lecturer at the University of Helsinki, where she taught American literature and drama as chair of American Studies.
</p><p>The U.S. State Department appointed her scholar in residence to represent American higher education in the U.S. and around the world. She's lectured and consulted for countless educational, governmental and nonprofit organizations.
</p><p>Among her community activities, she serves as vice president of the Forest Theater Guild.
</p><p>She can be heard every Sunday from noon to 1 p.m. on radio station KRXA 540, hosting "Poetry Slow Down," a program now in its third year.
</p><p>"Every week, I write an original show . . . to 'make it new,' as Ezra Pound said. My listeners keep me on my toes."
