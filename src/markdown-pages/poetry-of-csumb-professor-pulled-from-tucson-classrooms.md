<p>If your book is going to be removed from classrooms, being in the company of internationally acclaimed authors such as Martin Espada, James Baldwin and Sandra Cisneros is a good thing. That's how poet Diana Garcia, a professor of English at CSU Monterey Bay, feels about having her book, "When Living Was a Labor Camp," among 80 others now pulled from the classrooms of Tucson Unified School District in Arizona. â€“ <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, April 16, 2012
