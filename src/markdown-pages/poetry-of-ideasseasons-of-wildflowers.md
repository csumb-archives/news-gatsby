<h4>Poetry of ideas/seasons of wildflowers</h4><p>'The Alumni and Visitors Center has turned into gallery space to display artwork created by students in Professor Johanna Poethig's painting and mural class.
</p><p>A large, colorful mural, called Poetry of Ideas/Seasons of Wildflowers was recently installed on one of the walls in the public portion of the building.
</p><p>The design connects the seasons of growth between nature and students in their exchange of ideas and experiences. The wildflowers are found in the Monterey area and represent the uniqueness and individualism of the students united in one garden. Wildflowers grow, reach their potential, and release seeds for the next season of flowers. Students also grow while attending the university, exchange ideas and leave their mark for the next generation.
</p><p>The campus is invited to attend a public dedication of the mural at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 12.
