<p>CSU Monterey Bay, in collaboration with Rutgers University, has received a three-year, $1,100,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to fund the Polar Interdisciplinary Coordinated Education – ICE – program.</p><p>Polar ICE works to connect scientists with broader audiences to further the impact of their research, while connecting teachers and students from grade 5 through college with data and cutting&#45;edge science right in their classrooms. It focuses on sharing the story of how polar science is done by highlighting science skills and practices, exploring data and making meaning from scientific information.
</p><p>The grant will provide:
</p><p>The goal of the project is to produce instructional materials and trainings that engage more teachers and their classrooms in polar science. It will bring real&#45;world data, models and simulations into the classroom and make information about polar research widely available. And it will engage underserved students in scientific research.

Principal investigator is Dr. Corey Garza, associate professor in CSUMB’s Division of Science and Environmental Policy.
</p><p>“In addition to our Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, this new polar science program places our marine science program as a lead campus on two national, NSF&#45;funded education, research and outreach programs in the ocean sciences,” Dr. Garza said.
