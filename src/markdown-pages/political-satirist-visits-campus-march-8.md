<h3>HE PUTS THE &#039;MOCK&#039; IN DEMOCRACY
	Elect to laugh with Will Durst at the World Theater</h3><p>The World Theater gets in the spirit of the political season when it hosts comedian Will Durst on March 8.
</p><p>One of the premier political satirists in the country, Durst has patched together a comedy quilt of a career, weaving together columns, books, radio and television commentaries, acting and stand-up comedy.
</p><p><em>Will Durst is a natural successor to Mort Sahl.</em> – New York Post
</p><p>His motto is “You can’t make stuff up like this." The New York Times calls him "possibly the best political comic in the country," while the Portland Oregonian hails him as a “hilarious stand-up journalist.”
</p><p>The former radio talk show host currently writes a nationally syndicated humor column, and his pieces have appeared in Esquire, George, the San Francisco Chronicle, National Lampoon, The New York Times and dozens of other publications.
</p><p>He is a five-time Emmy nominee; has been fired by PBS three times; told jokes in 14 countries; and earned seven nominations for Stand-Up of the Year. His 800 or so television appearances include The David Letterman Show, HBO, Showtime, CNN, all four broadcast networks and the BBC. Tickets are $40 premium, $29 general admission. Discounts are available for students, seniors and military members. Tickets can be purchased <a href="http://csumb.edu/worldtheater">online</a> or by calling the box office at 582-4580.
