<h3>Monologues tell women's stories</h3><p>The Vagina Monologues returns to CSU Monterey Bay Feb. 12, 13 and 14.
</p><p>The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the "Vagina Monologues" tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world.
</p><p>CSUMB's production is student&#45;run, student&#45;directed and features student actors. The monologues address issues such as rape, birth, sex and relationships; some are serious, some are funny, all are enlightening and explore new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.
</p><p>The play's staging at CSUMB is part of this year's V&#45;Day campaign. V&#45;Day's mission: to celebrate women and girls and to stop the sexual violence being perpetrated against them all over the world. V&#45;Day has raised millions of dollars since it started 15 years ago and has been named one of Worth Magazine's "100 Best Charities." V&#45;Day has grown exponentially, from an underground feminist event to a mainstream media one. Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine's Day.
</p><p>The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about violence against women. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to local organizations working to do just that. This year's production will feature new monologues. Parents, please note the mature content and adult themes of the play.
