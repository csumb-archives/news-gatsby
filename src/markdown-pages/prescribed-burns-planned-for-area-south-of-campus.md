<p>The Army plans to conduct two <a href="https://csumb.edu/about/prescribed&#45;burns&#45;0">prescribed burns</a> – carefully controlled fires – on former Fort Ord lands sometime over the next three months.The exact timing is based on weather; the proper weather conditions typically exist in September and October.
</p><p>The area is a habitat reserve for Central Maritime Chaparral, which requires periodic fires to maintain a healthy ecosystem. The areas to be burned are located 3 miles south of the main campus and 3.5 miles south of East Campus.
</p><p>The Army cleanup office offers a direct notification program. Residents who register for the program will be notified by phone, text or e&#45;mail when a burn is imminent, when it is started and when it is complete. To register, call 242&#45;7383 or go online at www.FortOrdCleanup.com
