<p>President Dianne Harrison told the faculty and staff of CSU Monterey Bay that she senses “a powerful momentum across the campus” as the new academic year starts.
</p><p>The remark came during her State of the University address on Aug. 17, part of the annual Day of Welcome. “In spite of our external challenges with changes and budgets, as a university we have continued to move forward and continued to be responsive,” President Harrison told a capacity crowd in the World Theater. Then she reminded the audience of the university’s accomplishments: • A 31 percent increase in enrollment – from 3,600 to almost 5,200 students – in the five years since she arrived.
</p><p>• Planning for the next academic building, which will house the schools of Business and School of Computing and Design. • Four new majors added this year and another next summer, bringing the total to 23 undergraduate majors and eight graduate programs.
</p><p>• Reaffirmation of the university’s accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
</p><p>• Improvements in retention and graduation rates.
</p><p>• Attainment of a gold rating in STARS – a sustainability tracking system administered by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. “In my view, the reason we keep moving forward together – in spite of lean state budgets – is that each of us accepts our individual and collective responsibility as stewards of this institution,” Dr. Harrison said.
</p><p>"And we acknowledge that students are the center and core of our efforts. “We remain dedicated to providing our students with a world-class educational experience that culminates in a meaningful degree.”
</p><p>There was also sobering news. Because of budget cuts, the university had to turn away 3,000 qualified students. And because state financial projections are falling short, mid-year cuts are likely.
