<p>CSUMB administrators will join other California State University officials in bringing the college message to thousands of church members during the fifth annual CSU Super Sunday, a program to connect with and inform African American students and their families about what it takes to get into college.
</p><p>Now in its fifth year, Super Sunday, which began with 24 churches, has expanded to include more than 90 churches throughout the state and has led to the development of companion college fair events called Super Saturday.
</p><p>On three consecutive Sundays each February, CSU leaders including the chancellor, trustees, presidents and others speak at various churches across the state to share with students, parents and community mentors information about preparing for college, applying to the CSU's 23 campuses, and obtaining financial aid.
</p><p>CSUMB President Dianne Harrison and Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe will speak during church services on Feb. 21 at the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church and Greater Victory Temple Church, both located in Seaside.
</p><p>"At Super Sunday, thousands of students and their families learn that planning for college starts in the sixth grade. We hope to make communities aware of the steps that students need to complete each year to get to college," CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed said.
</p><p>"We are pleased to say that these efforts are paying off. Since Super Sunday began, the CSU has seen steady increases in African-American undergraduate enrollment."
</p><p>The event is part of the CSU African American initiative which started in 2005 when Chancellor Reed and Bishop Charles E. Blake convened community, civic, business and education leaders together to develop new ways to educate K-12th students, parents and families about the value of a college degree to ensure a stable future.
</p><p>A central theme of Super Sunday messages is a call to begin planning for college admission as early as middle school and to enroll in challenging classes that prepare students for college.
</p><p>Following the services, CSU outreach staff and church education counselors will provide information about college applications and financial aid. Students will also be introduced to <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSU Mentor</a>, the website that prospective students use to find information and apply to a CSU campus. Participants will also receive the "<a href="http://www.calstate.edu/college/">How to Get to College</a>" poster, which provides middle and high school students and their parents with step-by-step information on planning for college.
