<p>California State University, Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison was on a trip to Jordan and Oman from March 24 to April 8 as one of seven college and university leaders selected for the 2011 Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad Program.
</p><p>The seminar was an opportunity for them to learn about the changing higher education scene in the Arab world and return home to share opportunities for future program development in the region with their respective campuses.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison and the other presidents planned to meet with campus leaders in both countries to discuss institutional missions, resources, challenges and opportunities to work with American partners. The trip provided an opportunity to refine and expand the international vision and agenda of Cal State Monterey Bay and the California State University system.
</p><p>“Seminar members will undoubtedly develop a better understanding of these countries’ institutions of higher education,” Dr. Harrison said before her journey. “As we share expertise and gain knowledge, we also will be helping to break what President Obama has called a ‘cycle of suspicion and discord’ between the United States and Muslims worldwide.”
</p><p>She pointed out that a major objective of participating in the seminar is the chance to develop and strengthen international exchanges and opportunities for students and faculty at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>“I believe it is essential that we are inclusive of countries from all parts of the world, and that includes the Middle East,” Dr. Harrison said. “Our students and faculty can benefit by establishing partnerships with universities in the Middle East. By having their students come to the United States and to California, we also add to our existing diversity on our campus.”
