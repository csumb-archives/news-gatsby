<p><b>Ryan Shook, Master of Social Work</b></p>
<p><i>President's Graduate Award for Exemplary Regional Stewardship</i></p>
<p>
  <i> </i>Ryan Shook says no one encouraged him or showed him a pathway to
  college in high school, so it took him 20 years to realize he could earn a
  college degree. Now he’s graduating from CSUMB with a
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/socialwork">master’s degree in social work </a>and
  making sure others have the opportunities and support he didn’t.
</p>
<p>
  For his contributions to the Monterey County region as a student leader and
  social justice advocate, Shook has been honored with the President’s Graduate
  Award for Exemplary Regional Stewardship.
</p>
<p>
  Shook, who describes himself as “a person in long-term recovery from addiction
  and a formerly incarcerated individual,” began pursuing higher education in
  2011 at Gavilan College in Gilroy. He became a student ambassador with the
  Outreach and Recruitment department at Gavilan and helped students navigate
  the pathway to community college.
</p>
<p>
  “This work has been most effective with troubled and foster youth, teen
  parents, and students that just could not make it in mainstream high schools.
  I shared my own experiences, successes, and struggles in life and college,”
  Shook said.
</p>
<p>
  Through his sociology coursework, Shook discovered a passion for the study of
  social inequalities and a desire to help break down the barriers people face.
  He transferred to UC Santa Cruz and earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology in
  2016. At UCSC he helped conduct research about low-wage workers and
  discrimination. He also assisted in the design and implementation of an
  income-generating job training program for the Gilroy Compassion Center, a
  day-use homeless facility.
</p>
<p>
  Shook began working at Gavilan College as full-time Student Life Coordinator
  in 2016 to bring diverse programming and resources to students. He applied to
  CSUMB’s master’s of social work degree program and was accepted in 2017.
</p>
<p>
  “I just wanted to strengthen my job skills to better assist students to become
  more connected to the campus and the local community, but I received so much
  more. Through the class discussions and coursework, I was able to really
  internalize and vocalize who I am as a mixed-race, White-Mexican American. I
  learned to limit my own internalized oppression and use the privilege I was
  given to fight for equity in all aspects of my life,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  At CSUMB, Shook has conducted research on the impact of criminal justice
  history on graduate student success. His work was showcased at a forum
  sponsored by the Department of Social Work and the College of Health Sciences
  and Human Services. He also completed the rigorous Institutional Review Board
  process to continue this research and perhaps pursue a doctorate degree in the
  future.
</p>
<p>
  “In light of the many inequities known to be inherent in the criminal justice
  system, his research is providing valuable leadership in helping educational
  institutions provide opportunities for people who may have suffered unjustly
  from criminal justice involvement to pursue their education and live
  contributive lives through their professional endeavors,” said Kamilah Majied,
  a professor in the department of social work and Shook’s faculty research
  mentor.
</p>
<p>
  “In Mr. Shook, I have observed a level of dedication and commitment to
  excellence that is exceptional. He is deeply admired and respected by his
  colleagues,” Majied said. “Also, I have observed his advocacy for the rights
  of marginalized persons, his anti-racism work, his work as an ally with
  reference to people with disabilities, his capacity for cultural humility, and
  rigorous self-reflection as he grows as a scholar, researcher and advocate.”

<p><b>Jacqueline “Jackie” Ceccato, Visual &amp; Public Art</b></p>
<p>
  <i>President’s Award for Exemplary Student Achievement and </i
  ><i>Dean’s Medalist for College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences</i>
</p>
<p>
  As a freshman at CSUMB, Jackie Ceccato joined the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/as/">Associated Students (AS)</a> to become a part
  of the community and “explore new horizons.”
</p>
<p>
  “From the beginning, I knew that AS would allow me to leave my mark on campus
  and work with other students, staff, and faculty to improve the college
  experience for current and future CSUMB Otters,” she said.
</p>
<p>
  For her five years of successful work in that endeavor, Ceccato — who is
  graduating summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/vpa/">Visual &amp; Pubilc Art</a> — received this
  year’s President’s Award for Exemplary Student Achievement. The award honors
  one graduating student each year who has best demonstrated the values and
  commitments of CSUMB and made a notable contribution to a particular area of
  university life through depth of involvement and service as a student leader.
</p>
<p>
  Ceccato said her “proudest accomplishment at CSUMB” was planning the
  university’s annual Midnight Madness rally for three years as committee
  chairperson. A part of CSUMB’s annual homecoming Raft Week, the rally is the
  university’s largest student event and attracts nearly a thousand students,
  faculty and staff each year to kick off basketball season, celebrate CSUMB and
  foster school pride.
</p>
<p>
  “I was always intentional to ensure that many groups and students were both
  included in the planning and featured during the celebration. I loved working
  with multiple collaborators on campus, the event was always different and
  improved each year,” Ceccato said.
</p>
<p>
  Juan J. Guzman, AS Programming and Communications Coordinator, praised
  Ceccato’s work ethic and leadership ability.
</p>
<p>
  “I have never met a more committed and hardworking student leader. Jackie
  lives and breathes CSUMB. She is both a great team member and also a very
  capable autonomous leader,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  “She has been able to grow (Midnight Madness) each year and has solidified it
  as a highly anticipated campus tradition to the point that Raft Week is now
  planned around this massive event.”
</p>
<p>
  Ceccato’s AS career began as Monte Rey Commissioner, the person who
  coordinates appearances for CSUMB’s official mascot. She was later elected
  Athletics Senator to advocate for student-athletes and lead the AS Athletic
  Committee. She then transitioned to working as an AS Programming Specialist
  assisting in the planning, marketing, execution, and assessment of all AS
  programs, such as concerts, workshops, film screenings, late-night events and
  outreach initiatives.
</p>
<p>
  During her time at CSUMB, Ceccato was also an active member of the Delta Omega
  Rho Multicultural Sorority, the National Honor Society of Leadership and
  Success, and Active Minds, a mental health club whose goal is to help raise
  awareness and change the stigma against mental health problems.
</p>
<p>
  For her senior capstone project, Ceccato collaborated with Active Minds to
  revitalize their social media platforms and create advertising graphics for
  their events on campus.
</p>
<p>
  “By being a part of these organizations, I had the chance to turn my passions
  into actions and truly make a difference in a variety of communities at
  CSUMB,” Ceccato said.
</p>
<p>
  “Words cannot express how thankful I am to CSUMB. I know that all my
  experiences in the past five years will allow me to live a personal and
  professional life guided by the values and lessons that I have learned. I will
  never forget the importance of teamwork, the impact of actions, and the
  significance of showing kindness to others.”
</p>
<p>
  Ceccato also received the Dean’s Medalist Award for the College of Arts,
  Humanities and Social Sciences and the first annual Keland Family Endowed
  Memorial Award for Visual &amp; Public Art (VPA). Read more about the awards
