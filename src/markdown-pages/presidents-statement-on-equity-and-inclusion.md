  The Founding Vision statement of Monterey Bay states:
  <i
    >“The identity of the university will be framed by substantive commitment to
    multilingual, multicultural, gender-equitable learning.”</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  The commitment to create a community of diverse learners and scholars is an
  expression of caring, valuing and support for all the individuals who are part
  of this community. We all share a responsibility to ensure that we live,
  study, and work in an environment that fosters care, respect, and belonging.
  We are fortunate at CSUMB to have a community of individuals with diverse
  journeys, perspectives, beliefs, cultures, abilities, and identities who are
  able to interact with and learn from each other every day. Ensuring that
  everyone in our community is respected and receives equal access and
  opportunity is critical to fulfilling the promise of Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p>
<p>
  The Founding Vision of Monterey Bay defined a university that would be
  dedicated to the success of all the diverse peoples of California. Since our
  founding, we have remained committed to that vision and to maintaining a
  “culture of innovation,” which is enhanced by embracing the diverse
  perspectives, cultures and journeys that are present in our community. In this
  community we know that diversity and inclusive excellence are not just lofty
  words, but are necessary attributes of an education that provides the ability
  to succeed in a rapidly changing world.
</p>
<p>
  I encourage all of us in our Monterey Bay community to not only foster a
  culture that embraces diversity and inclusion, but to also continually look
  for ways to leverage that diversity as an asset in improving the education of
  our students for the changing demands and requirements of global citizenship.
