<h3>Electric vehicle enthusiast charged up by EV rally</h3><p>Cal State Monterey Bay Professor Dan Fernandez was one of hundreds of electric vehicle buffs who helped the U.S. reclaim a world record Sept. 20 in Cupertino.
</p><p>The record for the world’s largest parade of electric vehicles was set at a National Drive Electric Week event at De Anza College. Dr. Fernandez’s Nissan Leaf was one of the 507 vehicles in the parade. A Guinness World Record official was on hand to certify that the event surpassed the previous record of a 481&#45;car parade set last May in Stuttgart, Germany.
</p><p>Dr. Fernandez, who teaches in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, is the organizer of the university’s FOCUS event, CSUMB’s annual look at sustainability issues. He co&#45;chaired the campus&#45;wide sustainability committee that produced the university’s Climate Action Plan and works to integrate sustainability issues throughout the curriculum. Ironically, the record&#45;setting event wasn’t all good news. “On the way home, I – for the first time – ran out of charge and needed a tow,” Dr. Fernandez said.
