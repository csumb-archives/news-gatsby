<p>A new study has revealed that the nature of cell phone communications between a parent and adolescent child can reveal the quality of their relationship. Rob Weisskirch, professor at CSU Monterey Bay, noted that parents can use a cell phone to extend their parenting reach: to monitor an adolescent's whereabouts and activities, offer support or voice disapproval, for example. â€“ The Times of India, June 28, 2011
