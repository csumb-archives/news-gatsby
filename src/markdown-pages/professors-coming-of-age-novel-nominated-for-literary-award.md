<p>Professor Deb Busman’s novel <em>Like a Woman</em> is a finalist for a <a href="http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/news/03/08/28th&#45;annual&#45;lambda&#45;literary&#45;award&#45;finalists&#45;announced/">Lambda Literary Award</a>. The awards, in multiple categories, celebrate achievement in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender writing published in 2015.
</p><p>Busman is a fiction/creative non&#45;fiction writer, co&#45;director of CSUMB’s Creative Writing and Social Action program and an associate professor in the Division of Humanities and Communication.

<em><a href="http://www.lambdaliterary.org/reviews/03/26/like&#45;a&#45;woman&#45;by&#45;debra&#45;busman/">Like a Woman</a></em> is a coming&#45;of&#45;age story, revealing the lives of teenage girls on the streets of Los Angeles, trying to hold onto their sense of humanity against a backdrop of racism, poverty, sexism and violence.

In an interview with the Santa Cruz Sentinel last March, Busman said the project began as a memoir of her own growing up. “It’s easier to tell the truth using fiction, for me. I was more interested in capital&#45;T Truths that I was in my own particular story,” she said. “And I wanted to explore some of the other characters in the story as well.

“As a fiction writer, you get to tell everybody’s story.”
</p><p>Several of the book’s chapters have been published in anthologies of short fiction. Busman told the Sentinel that her students encouraged her to get the book published. “As a professor of creative writing, I started to feel a little hypocritical that I wasn’t even doing what it took to put my own book out into the world.”
</p><p>The Lambda award winners will be announced in June.
