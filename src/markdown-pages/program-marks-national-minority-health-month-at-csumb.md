<p>The community is invited to join Cal State Monterey Bay’s College of Health Sciences and Human Services on April 26 to mark National Minority Health Month.</p><p>A pair of speakers will focus on farmworker and immigrant health:
</p><p>• <strong>Gil Cedillo</strong>, a member of the Los Angeles City Council and former state senator and assemblyman. As father of the California Dream Act and the legislation that allowed undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses, Cedillo has paved the way for justice among California’s most vulnerable populations. He will address needs to create health equity among the migrant population.

• <strong>Carlos Ugarte</strong>, director of health programs for Farmworker Justice, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit organization that seeks to empower migrants to improve their living and working conditions. Known for his efforts in creating and supporting community healthworker programs, Ugarte will share challenges and solutions to achieve farmworker health equity.

A question&#45;and&#45;answer session and a reception will follow the presentations.
The event will be held from 3 to 5 p.m. in the World Theater on the CSUMB campus. While the program is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a dispenser on the lot.
