<p>The community is invited to a screening of Godfrey Reggio’s prophetic 1982 film, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> at 4 p.m., Oct. 1, in the TAT studio. The director will make a presentation and then screen the film. <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> – “life out of balance” in the Hopi language – is a visual tone poem with no dialogue and no conventional plot, which the director describes as a reversal of the typical saying that “a picture is worth a thousand words,” and is instead “a thousand images to convey the power of one word.” The film presents a stunning montage of images from urban traffic to desert vistas to electronic circuits, accompanied by a score from Philip Glass to explore the threats posed to nature by modern civilization. One critic called it a “unique, contemplative film.”
</p><p>Said Walter Ryce in the Monterey County Weekly: "It is a wordless work that said much about the world then (1982), and the world we live in now."  The showing and talk kicks off the Philip Glass Center for the Arts, Science and the Environment's annual Days and Nights Festival at Big Sur's Henry Miller Library and Carmel's Sunset Center. <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2013/sep/25/faculty-filmmakers-featured-days-and-nights-festival"><em>Faculty filmmakers' work screened at Days and Nights Festival</em></a>
