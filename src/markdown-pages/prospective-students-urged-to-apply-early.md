</p><p>Priority admissions for 2010-11 opens Thursday, Oct. 1, at California State University, Monterey Bay, and officials are encouraging students to apply early because state budget cuts mean fewer will be admitted. Those who apply during the priority period, which ends Nov. 30, have a better chance of being admitted in fall 2010, provided they qualify and complete all requirements. State budget cuts have caused all California State University campuses to decrease enrollment during the next two years. "CSU Monterey Bay expects to cut enrollment by 10 percent," said Dr. Ronnie Higgs, associate vice president for enrollment services.
</p><p>"All prospective students should apply early as admissions to the university will be based on a first-come, first-served basis," Dr. Higgs said. "CSUMB will most likely reach its maximum allotted number much earlier than Nov. 30. At that point, all other applicants will be put on a wait list." High school seniors can visit <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">www.csumentor.edu</a> to submit applications. More information is available by calling the Office of Admissions at (831) 582-3738.
