</p><p>Who's tracking your online activities? What shouldn't you do online? How can you use social media without risk? How can you protect your identity from online fraud and theft?
</p><p>These are some of the legal, political and practical aspects of individual privacy and identity protection that will be discussed at Privacy 2.0: Demand Your Dot Rights, a free community forum to be held from 6:30 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 29  at CSU Monterey Bay's University Center.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by the university and the Monterey County chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</p><p>Speakers include Dr. Chip Lenno, chief information officer at CSUMB; Arlene Krebs, technology development officer at CSUMB; and Tamar Gubbins, technology and civil liberties policy associate of the ACLU of Northern California.
</p><p>Attendees will learn how e-mail providers, social media networks such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter and online companies gather personal data and use it.
</p><p>For more information on the issue, visit dotrights.org.
</p><p>The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue, adjacent to the World Theater. For driving directions and a campus map, visit csumb.edu/map.**
