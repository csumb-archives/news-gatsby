<p><b>Alexandra Thomsen, Environmental Science, M.S.</b></p>
<p><i>Provost’s Graduate Award for Exemplary Academic Achievement</i></p>
<p>
  <i> </i>A dedicated student and researcher, Alexandra Thomsen graduated from
  CSUMB with a perfect 4.0 GPA, a
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/environmentalscience/">master of science</a>
  degree, and a clear path to pursue an impactful career in coastal conservation
  and restoration.
</p>
<p>
  “The research that Ms. Thomsen is conducting is likely to help drive policy
  decisions up and down the coast. She is helping to restore 65 acres of a salt
  marsh ecosystem in order to make the region more resilient to sea level rise
  due to climate change,” said Fran Horvath, CSUMB’s interim provost and
  Thomsen’s campus thesis advisor.
</p>
<p>
  Even so, it’s her dedication to educating others that makes her most deserving
  of the Provost’s Graduate Award, Horvath said. The recipient must be an
  academic role model and leader who contributes to the learning and development
  of others.
</p>
<p>
  Thomsen earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from Brown University in 2016,
  and began the master’s in environmental science program at CSUMB in 2018.
  Throughout her college career, she has volunteered in the community to promote
  science education..
</p>
<p>
  While at CSUMB, Thomsen mentored students in a program at North Monterey High
  School to encourage careers in marine science. She completed advanced training
  in geographic information systems and developed a lesson and activities for
  students. She also volunteered for the Sea Lion Bowl, a regional competition
  of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl.
</p>
<p>
  On campus Thomsen worked with the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/"
    >Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center (UROC)</a
  >, helping students with their projects. She served on the Summer 2019
  Graduate Student Panel Workshop and met with smaller informal groups through
  coffee hours. In spring 2019, she promoted the School of Natural Sciences’
  Seminar Series as outreach coordinator.
</p>
<p>
  In 2019 the UC Davis Coastal and Marine Science Institute selected Thomsen for
  its Scholar Training Program, which teaches participants how to advance
  environmental policy issues. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration Center for Coastal and Marine Ecosystems named Thomsen a
  Graduate Research Scholar in 2018. In that role, she shared science
  information with the general public through a blog.
</p>
<p>
  “I am extremely grateful for my time at CSUMB, which has helped me prepare for
  a future career in applied coastal science through a rigorous course plan
  focused on skill development, opportunities to apply course material to my own
  research and internship, and the ability to apply for and participate in other
  training programs,” Thomsen said.

<p><b>Amanda Hansen, Psychology</b></p>
<p><i>Provost’s Award for Exemplary Academic Achievement</i></p>
<p>
  When Amanda Hansen transferred to CSUMB after graduating from the College of
  Marin in 2017, she had “a vague sense of wanting to help individuals with
  mental health concerns,” she said. At CSUMB, Hansen solidified her goal and
  earned a coveted place in a prestigious clinical psychology doctorate program
  at Kent State University.
</p>
<p>
  “I attribute this success to the opportunities afforded to me by CSUMB and the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/psychology/">psychology department’s</a> wonderful
  faculty members,” Hansen said. In addition, the university has “assisted me in
  gaining invaluable research training and hands-on experience working with
  diverse groups of people,” she said.
</p>
<p>
  For her accomplishments in research and extracurricular work while maintaining
  a 3.83 GPA, Hansen received this year’s Provost’s Award for Exemplary Academic
  Excellence.
</p>
<p>
  Hansen worked extensively in the community while at CSUMB. She pursued a
  service learning opportunity at a local housing nonprofit for individuals
  living with severe mental illness and substance dependence. She volunteered
  for a local rape crisis center and a national crisis text line. She worked at
  a local youth homeless shelter, and co-facilitated sessions in a batterer
  intervention program. She also helped facilitate group sessions on campus at
  the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/pgcc/">Personal Growth and Counseling Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Hansen actively contributed to three research projects as a
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/">UROC</a> researcher. Each project directly
  related to her interest in personality dysfunction and its assessment. She
  presented this work to on-campus, regional, and national professional
  audiences, as well as to a local municipal agency, according to Danielle
  Burchett, associate professor of clinical psychology and Hansen’s research
  mentor.
</p>
<p>
  As part of a community-based research project, Amanda networked with
  organizations within the Seaside Blue Ribbon Task Force for Youth Violence
  Prevention. She participated in obtaining institutional review board approval,
  drafting the consent and youth assent forms, and facilitating three focus
  groups with adolescents.
</p>
<p>
  “Amanda is a go-getter who seeks opportunity for growth and manages a very
  busy schedule successfully,” Burchett said. “Given her strengths in writing
  and statistics, efforts to improve her research and clinical skills, attention
  to detail, and efforts to be a peer mentor and role model, I’m confident she
  will be a thoughtful and successful scholar and clinician who will make a
  positive impact in her career.”
