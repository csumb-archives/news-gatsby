<p>Kathryn England-Aytes, a lecturer in psychology at CSUMB, has contributed to a book that’s the first of its kind for educational publishing.
</p><p>“Teaching Truly: A Curriculum to Indigenize Mainstream Education,” published by Peter Lang Publishers, was written by American Indian rights activist Four Arrows. It provides guidance on incorporating indigenous perspectives into classrooms from kindergarten through college.
</p><p>Guest authors, including Professor England-Aytes, contributed six of the book’s 13 chapters. Her chapter deals with American Indian historical trauma and education.
</p><p>“Four Arrows is a respected educator,” Professor England-Aytes said. “I was honored he asked me to participate.”
</p><p>The book has been praised by Noam Chomsky, William Ayers and Henry Giroux, among others.
</p><p>Chomsky, MIT professor emeritus, said of it:
</p><p>"This enlightening book reminds us that the grim prognosis for life on this planet is the consequence of a few centuries of forgetting what traditional societies knew, and the surviving ones still recognize. We must nurture and preserve our common possession, the traditional commons, for future generations, and this must be one of our highest values, or we are all doomed. To regain this sensibility from those who have preserved it we must pay careful attention to their understanding and practices, especially their educational practices as brought to us in these thoughtful chapters."
