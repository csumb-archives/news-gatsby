<h3>Piece by CSUMB faculty member Lanier Sammons to be performed</h3><p>Wayla J. Chambo will present a program of works for flute at a free public performance April 4 at CSU Monterey Bay. The 7 p.m. concert will be held in the Music Hall, located on Sixth Avenue near Butler Street. The concert will feature pieces for flute alone and flute with electronics. The work explores the intersections of text and music. The program includes three new pieces written for Chambo by emerging composers Lanier Sammons, a lecturer in CSUMB’s Music and Performing Arts Department; Sarah Summar; and L. Scott Price, all based on Chambo’s poetry. The composers were offered a selection of poems, and invited to choose one and use it in some way to construct a piece. The program includes existing contemporary pieces. In addition, selections from Charles Koechlin’s “Les Chants de Nectaire,” a massive cycle for solo flute inspired by the writings of Anatole France and Virgil, are interspersed throughout the program, providing a connecting thread. In addition to her performing work, Chambo also has a background in creative writing and has published poems in The Greensboro Review, Artizen, and Cellar Door.
