<p>Sam Koji Hale, an animator and puppet maker, will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 10 for a pair of events open to the public.
</p><p>Hale has more than a decade of experience making animated films, which combine computer effects with puppetry, and has won numerous awards for his work.
</p><p>Perhaps his best-known work, “Yamasong,” has been honored at the Atlanta Film Festival, the Graphation Film Festival in Los Angeles and the World Music and Independent Film Festival. His other credits include art director for the Cartoon Network show “Annoying Orange,” lead VFX artist for Disney Jr.’s “Bite-Sized Adventures of Sam Sandwich,” and associate producer for Disney’s pilot, “Team Smithereen.”
</p><p>On April 10:
</p><p>• From 3-5 p.m., Mr. Hale will present a workshop on stop-motion puppet making. He will discuss his fabrication and construction process and show how he made “Yamasong” and his current work-in-progress, “Monster of the Sky.”
</p><p>• From 7-9 p.m., Mr. Hale will present the latest collection of Handmade Puppet Dreams, a film series created by Heather Henson, daughter of the late Jim Henson. Handmade Puppet Dreams is a touring festival of films, created by independent artists. The films focus primarily on marionettes, finger puppets and paper cutouts, and showcase a new generation of puppeteers who embrace film as a medium of artistic expression. Mr. Hale works as a producer for Handmade Puppet Dreams.
</p><p>Both events will be held in the Cinematic Arts Building on Sixth Avenue and A Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>. While the events are free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot.
</p><p>Some of the films contain mature content and are not suitable for children younger than 14.
</p><p>On April 12, the university and MY Museum will partner to offer a program for the whole family. At 1 p.m., puppet films will be screened, followed by puppet-making activities with Mr. Hale. The program is free with museum admission. MY Museum is located at 425 Washington St., Monterey.
</p><p>CSUMB is developing an animation curriculum within its <a href="http://csumb.edu/tat">Cinematic Arts and Technology Department.</a> This is the program’s first public event.
