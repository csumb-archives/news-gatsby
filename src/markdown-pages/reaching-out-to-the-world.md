<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s reach extends far beyond California’s Central Coast. About 100 students from other nations attend CSUMB each year for a semester or two, and at least that many CSUMB students travel abroad.
</p><p>In addition, dozens of international students come to campus each year to study English through an intensive American language and culture program. Opportunities for exchange have just expanded with the signing of an agreement with Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU) in Taiwan. Dr. Jyh-tong Teng, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Taiwanese university, visited CSUMB recently. As part of his visit, the two universities signed an agreement to promote academic and student exchange. The schools agreed to cooperate on research activities, to share academic materials and publications, and to exchange faculty members and students. CYCU has 16,000 students in seven college and schools. The Times Higher Education rankings of universities in Asia lists it among the top 100 schools, based on teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. <a href="http://international.csumb.edu">Learn more about international programs at CSUMB</a>.
