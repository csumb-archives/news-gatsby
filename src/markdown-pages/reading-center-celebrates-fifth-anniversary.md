<p>To coincide with National Children’s Book Week and Exceptional Children's Week, CSU Monterey Bay will celebrate the fifth anniversary of its Center for Reading Diagnosis and Instruction on May 10.
</p><p>Author Luke Herzog and illustrator Pam Carroll will be on hand as the center commemorates five years of serving the tri-county community with an open house from 3 to 5 p.m.
</p><p>At 11 years old, Luke is already a published author. The fifth grader’s novel, “Dragon Valley,” tells the story of five dragons scientifically spawned in a laboratory and is aimed at the pre-teen set.
</p><p>Carroll, a Carmel artist, is a nationally known illustrator and painter; her work includes fanciful illustrations for children’s books published by Sleeping Bear Press.
</p><p>The reading center is unique in the region. It works directly with youngsters from kindergarten to 12th grade who have reading difficulties, providing individualized instruction in reading and language arts.
</p><p>It was made possible by a $2.5 million gift from an anonymous donor. Since it opened in 2007, more than 300 students have received instructional assistance. In addition, the center offers summer reading camps for youngsters and provides professional development opportunities for teachers.
</p><p>The center is located at Seventh Avenue and A Street on the CSUMB campus. To RSVP for the open house, call 582-5259; for more information about the reading center, click <a href="http://readingcenter.csumb.edu/">here</a>.
