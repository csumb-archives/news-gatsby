</p><p>For the second straight year, California State University, Monterey Bay has received a $5,000 grant from the outdoor recreation retailer REI for the Return of the Natives project.
</p><p>The grant was presented to Laura Lee Lienk and Emily Smith of the Watershed Institute. It will help to provide a living allowance for an AmeriCorps volunteer who will work with school children and local teachers, CSU Monterey Bay students and community volunteers on habitat restoration projects on the Fort Ord dunes and the creeks of Salinas.
</p><p>Return of the Natives (RON) is dedicated to bringing people closer to nature and nature closer to people through hands-on experience in restoring habitats. RON, the education and outreach branch of the Watershed Institute, is housed at CSUMB.
</p><p>"We're excited to be partners – on many levels – with REI," Lienk said. "Their staff volunteers for our events, they publicize the work of Return of the Natives/Watershed Institute in the community, and now to be one of a very few regional grant recipients is wonderful."
</p><p>REI encourages protection and restoration of the environment through its philanthropic activities. The Kent, Wash.-based company gave away $3.7 million last year to support outdoor stewardship and connect children to nature.
</p><p>"We're excited that some of our support can go to our neighbor, CSUMB," said Ellie Kincade, outreach specialist for REI's Marina store. "It's the perfect match. It feels like family."
