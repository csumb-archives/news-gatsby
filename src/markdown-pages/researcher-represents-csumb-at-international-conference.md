<p>A shortage of fish in the ocean, combined with human population growth, means global shortfalls for traditional food sources. Squid may help to fill the gap.
</p><p>That’s according to Michael Navarro, a National Science Foundation post&#45;doctoral scholar in Science &amp; Environmental Policy at CSUMB.
</p><p>Navarro recently presented his research at the Cephalopod International Advisory Council &#40;CIAC&#41; conference in Hakodate, Japan. The event is widely considered the most important international conference for cephalopod &#40;or squid&#41; science, with more than 240 participants from 30 countries in attendance.

Navarro’s presentation supported conference efforts for a new research paper on the critical role of cephalopods in the global food supply chain. Cephalopod fisheries are increasingly viewed as a viable alternative.

This research is aligned with Navarro’s primary focus at CSUMB.
</p><p>After earning his Ph.D. from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Navarro came to CSUMB and the Marine Ecology Lab managed by Corey Garza, a CSUMB associate professor in Science &amp; Environmental Policy. Navarro was interested in Garza’s research, which focuses on the latest Geographic Information System methods to test hypotheses on which spatial scales and habitat types drive ecological/species patterns. In other words, why are animals seen where they are seen?
</p><p>Surprisingly, questions like this haven't been rigorously tested for many ecologically and economically important species, according to Navarro. “This type of research provides the foundation of needed ecological information as new challenges arise. Our oceans continue to be affected from climate change and the human population continues to grow,” he said.
</p><p>Along with CSUMB, other institutions represented at the <a href="www.ciac2015.com.">CIAC conference</a> included UC Berkeley, UCLA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
