</p><p>A CSU Monterey Bay faculty member is joining with the Nature Conservancy and several other partners on a study to assess the impact of trawl fishing in Morro Bay, using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV).
</p><p>Moving just above the seafloor, the ROV – an underwater robot equipped with cameras – gathers video and still photographs of marine life and habitats, vital data in the fight to save California's threatened oceans.
</p><p>The ROV is tethered to and piloted from a ship. It scans the ocean floor and transmits data to the ship's onboard computers, where it is recorded for analysis by scientists.
</p><p>Using the ROV, Dr. James Lindholm of CSU Monterey Bay and other members of the research team – the Conservancy, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Marine Applied Research and Exploration and fishing partners – can evaluate how the seafloor and the animals that live there recover after being trawled.
</p><p>Dr. Lindholm has long been interested in the recovery of the seafloor and marine life from alteration  by human activities, especially from trawling – a method of commercial fishing that involves pulling a large net through the water behind a boat.
</p><p>"Trawling impacts the seafloor," Dr. Lindholm said. "What we don't know is<strong>how</strong>the seafloor recovers following trawling – or different levels of trawling."
</p><p>One of the challenges in doing this kind of research is finding a place that can serve as a control area. "We need a place where there is trawling, and a comparable place where it isn't allowed – with the habitat types we want to study," the CSUMB professor explained.
</p><p>As part of a larger project, the Nature Conservancy recently bought out trawling permits in Morro Bay, effectively making it a closed area – and giving researchers the control site they need.
</p><p>Trawling has been a contentious issue, pitting fishermen against environmentalists.
</p><p>"We aren't interested in banning any particular kind of gear," Dr. Lindholm said. "Rather, we want to provide the science that facilitates good decision-making so that the resources on the seafloor can be managed better, in the interests of fishermen, conservationists and all the people who eat fish."
</p><p>Graduate students at CSUMB and Moss Landing and a handful of CSUMB undergraduates will also work on the project.
</p><p>"I love working with the Nature Conservancy," he said. "It's a great project for our students to be involved in, for the science we will produce and for the broader effort of being involved with supporting the Morro Bay community."
</p><p>The five-year study was kicked off recently with a name-the-ROV contest. The Nature Conservancy invited the public to vote for their favorite name online. The winning name will be announced on Sept. 25.
</p><p>The nominations are:
</p><p>• Beagle - Darwin's famous ship
</p><p>• Petrale Patrol
</p><p>• Rachel Carson - A legend among environmentalists
</p><p>• Rock Lobster
</p><p>• Nemo
</p><p>For the record, Dr. Lindholm prefers "Nemo."
</p><p>"Operationally, writing a single, short word on data sheets would be easier."
