<p>The Rugby Club at CSU Monterey Bay invites the community to attend a free screening of the Oscar-nominated film “Invictus” on Oct. 7.
</p><p>The film will be shown at 6 p.m. in Room 1188 of the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>. 
</p><p>Directed by Clint Eastwood, “Invictus” tells the story of how South African President Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) joined forces with the captain of South Africa's rugby team, Francois Plenaar (Matt Damon) to help unite the country. South Africa was still economically and racially divided in the aftermath of apartheid when the team won the 1995 Rugby World Cup.
</p><p>The showing is timed to coincide with the Rugby World Cup being contested through Oct. 23 in New Zealand.
</p><p>“The Rugby Club, along with the Otter Student Union, decided to sponsor this film because it shows the place of sports in ethical, social and political struggles,” said club president Ryan Scott.
</p><p>To reach Room 1188, attendees must use the back entrance to the library. The film is free, but visitors must purchase a parking permit from dispensers located on the parking lot adjacent to the library.
