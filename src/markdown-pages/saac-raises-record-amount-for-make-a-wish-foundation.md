<p>Student-athletes at CSU Monterey Bay hosted an evening of fun for their fellow students while celebrating National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week in mid-October.
</p><p>The Student Athlete Advisory Council organized a night of Gatorade Pong that drew approximately 50 two-person teams to the Black Box Cabaret on Oct. 16.
</p><p>The real winner: the Make-A-Wish Foundation, beneficiary of the $1,000 that was raised that night. It’s the most money raised in the four-year history of G-Pong at CSUMB.
</p><p>In Gatorade Pong, participants attempt to land a ping pong ball in a cup partially full of the sports drink on the opposite end of a long table. If they succeed, their opponent’s team must drink the contents of the cup.
</p><p>The SAAC first hosted G-Pong in 2009 as a way to show students that an evening of fun doesn’t have to involve alcohol. It has held the event at least once a year since then. The university’s sports medicine team supplied the Gatorade. Sodexo, the university’s food service provider, donated snacks.
