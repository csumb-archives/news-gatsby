</p><p><strong>President Harrison accepts plaque for University Promise program</strong>
</p><p>The Salinas City Council gave President Dianne Harrison a plaque of commendation Tuesday in appreciation for CSU Monterey Bay's University Promise program of outreach to Salinas sixth-graders.
</p><p>Since last spring, about 2,000 students from the Alisal Union and Salinas City school districts have visited campus for a presentation that conveys the promise that they can attend CSUMB if they stay in school and meet basic requirements. The visits end with a campus tour.
</p><p>"Giving young people hope in this community is not a small thing," Mayor Dennis Donohue said.
</p><p>Accepting the plaque, Dr. Harrison said many people deserve credit for the ongoing University Promise program and CSU Monterey Bay's other community outreach efforts.
</p><p>"Nothing gets done at a university without the help and work of many people," she said. "So, on behalf of all our faculty, staff and students, I thank you."
</p><p>Dr. Harrison (pictured above) also briefed the council and audience at Salinas City Hall on the many strong connections between the university and the community, which is home to about 10 percent of CSUMB students.
