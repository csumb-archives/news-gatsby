<p>Approximately 500 sixth-graders filled the ballroom of CSU Monterey Bay’s University Center on Dec. 8, radiating energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>As master of ceremonies, it was up to admissions office staff member Victor Torres to get them focused on the reason for their campus visit. Torres, a CSUMB graduate, handled the task masterfully, using a combination of games and positive reinforcement.
</p><p>The youngsters came from six schools in the Salinas City Elementary School District – Loma Vista, Natividad, El Gabilan, Boronda Meadows, Kammann and Laurel Wood – to participant in the University Promise program, held annually since 2009.
</p><p>The idea is to get them thinking about and planning for college, even though it’s six years away.
</p><p>Director of Admissions David Linnevers administered the University Promise oath. The students promised to show respect for their parents, do their best in school, graduate from high school and attend college, and be the best person they can be.
</p><p>In return, Linnevers promised that the university would save a spot for them if they complete high school and meet other basic requirements. As part of the promise, the university will work with the students and their parents to provide support and help arrange financial aid.
</p><p>The students received a packet containing a poster that explains what they need to do to prepare for college on a year&#45;by&#45;year basis starting in the sixth grade; a certificate for them to sign acknowledging their promise to prepare for and attend college; information on the outreach and support programs available at CSUMB; and a letter to their parents explaining the event and asking them to frame and display the certificate.
</p><p>And they received a Junior Otter card, with a space for their signature. The card reminds the students of their promise.

University students led the youngsters on a tour of campus, visiting the science building, the library, the Business and Information Technology Building and other spots.
</p><p>Over six days ending Dec. 9, approximately 3,200 youngsters from Alisal Union, Gonzales Unified, Monterey Peninsula Unified and Salinas City Elementary school districts visited CSUMB. Since the program began in the spring of 2009, nearly 20,000 Monterey County sixth&#45;graders have visited campus. 
</p><p>The program was developed by CSUMB officials and Salinas City Elementary administrators as a way to help youngsters recognize opportunities, make choices that they may not have known existed for them, and keep them motivated for success.
