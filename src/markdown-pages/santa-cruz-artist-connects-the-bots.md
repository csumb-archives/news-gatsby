<p>Margo Mullen continues to attract attention – and commissions – with her robots.
</p><p>The 2006 graduate of CSU Monterey Bay’s visual and public art program created a pair of robots for a public art project in Santa Cruz last summer. Her canvas: a square traffic controller box located on a street corner. The box houses the equipment that operates traffic signals.
</p><p>Her tiny mural shows two robots, one red and the other yellow, holding hands. Their clasped hands form a heart.
</p><p>At the time, Mullen told the Santa Cruz Sentinel that the robots were created – literally – in a moment of darkness, when the power went out in her studio. She had watercolor paper, ink and a headlamp; with those tools, she created a series of robots.
</p><p>“They just happened,” she told the newspaper. Featured on her business cards, they travel with her everywhere. “They’ve become my little friends.”
</p><p>Now, those “friends” will grace illustrations for a permanent exhibition at the Oakland Museum of California.
</p><p>“I had a meeting last month, the museum people love the work and now, together, we will be creating an interactive piece in the Natural Science Gallery in the museum,” she said.
</p><p>“The gallery will be telling the story of seven different regions in our environmentally diverse state of California,” Mullen said. “The robots and I will be representing the Oakland section of the gallery. “I am creating three backgrounds and 21 characters/props for the project.” The gallery is currently closed for remodeling and is set to re-open in 2013.
</p><p>For another recent project, Mullen was commissioned to create artwork for Sacramento's annual Chalk It Up event, a fundraiser for children’s art education programs, held over Labor Day weekend. Her design, featuring – what else? – pink and orange bots and the words, Chalk It Up to Sacramento, will appear on T-shirts available at the event.
</p><p>Her work – from buttons to magnets, cards to pillows – is available <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/studiomargo">online</a>. 
</p><p>At CSUMB, Mullen is best known as the artist behind the mural at the Aquatic Center. Read about that project <a href="http://success.csumb.edu/margo-mullen">here</a>.
