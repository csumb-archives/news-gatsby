<p>The lives of Santa Cruz attorney Paul Meltzer and his great-grandfather, Harold Heath, barely overlapped, but the legend of the marine scientist and his adventures at sea lived on in the family history. In honor of Heath, one of the first professors at Stanford, Meltzer recently donated a 46-foot Hatteras sport fishing yacht to the CSUMB marine science program. â€” <em>San Jose Mercury News</em>, Dec. 17, 2010
