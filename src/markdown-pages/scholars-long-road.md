<p>It was about an 80-minute walk for Jose Hernandez from his home to his middle school in the village near San Luis Potosi, Mexico. . . . Hernandez traveled more than 1,800 miles from his hometown to Salinas, but even further on his educational road. He was named the Hearst Scholar at CSUMB, one of the top honors for students in the CSU system. â€“ <em>Monterey Herald,</em> Oct. 9, 2012
