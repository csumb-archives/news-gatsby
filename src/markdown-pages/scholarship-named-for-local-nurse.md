<p>The Rotary Club of Monterey Pacific has established the Nora Walsh Nursing Scholarship at Cal State Monterey Bay. </p><p>It will award $1,000 annually to a nurse graduating from Monterey Peninsula College. Selection will be based on academic achievement and volunteer efforts at the RotaCare clinic in Seaside.
</p><p>The award, the first named scholarship available to CSUMB nursing students, was established to honor Nora Walsh, a nurse for more than 35 years and a charter member of the <a href="http://montereypacificrotary.org/">Monterey Pacific Rotary.</a>
</p><p>Walsh worked in a private oncology practice in Monterey for more than 20 years. Although she often assumed the responsibilities of nursing management, her passion was the direct care of her patients. She  provided education and direct counsel to them and  their families, assistance with quality of life, hospice care and end of life issues.

Along with her endless hours of serving alongside her fellow Rotarians, her
</p><p>volunteer efforts included starting a cancer support group, aiding the Relay for Life, and cooking for the homeless at a local church.
</p><p>The Rotary Club of Monterey Pacific recognizes Walsh’s spirit of community involvement by naming this scholarship in her honor. Her legacy will continue with those who benefit from it.
</p><p>CSUMB’s nursing program is intended for students who have an associate’s degree in nursing and want to earn a <a href="https://csumb.edu/nursing">Bachelor of Science in Nursing</a>. Classes are designed to accommodate working RNs – held in the late afternoon and early evening. Some classes are face&#45;to&#45;face, some are online. The first class of graduates completed their studies last December.
