</p><p>***May 17 talk sponsored by Rethinking Schools of CSUMB ***
</p><p>Renowned school reformer Deborah Meier will present a talk at Oasis Charter Public School in Salinas at 6 p.m., May 17. The talk is free and open to the public.
</p><p>A senior scholar at New York University, she will discuss the current climate of top-down reforms and her vision of democratic progressive education for a pluralistic society.
</p><p>Meier has spent more than 40 years working for education reform as a teacher, writer and public advocate. A well-respected critic of state-mandated standards and testing, she believes that a strong community of parents, teachers and students is necessary to build effective schools. She founded and served as teacher-director of several innovative public schools that serve predominantly low-income African-American and Latino students. Those schools are considered exemplars of reform nationally.
</p><p>Her books include The Power of Their Ideas (1995), In Schools We Trust (2002), Keeping School (with Ted and Nancy Sizer, 2004) and Many Children Left Behind (2004).
</p><p>The talk is sponsored by Rethinking Schools/La Educaci√≥n Reinventada of California State University, Monterey Bay, a group of educators committed to equity, justice and multiculturalism within the public education system.
</p><p>Oasis Charter School is located at 1135 Westridge Parkway, Salinas, behind Costco in the Westridge Mall.
