<p>Images from the <a href="http://seafloor.otterlabs.org">Seafloor Mapping Lab </a>at CSU Monterey Bay have been put to use by an East Coast artist. 
</p><p>Margaret Boozer, a ceramist and sculptor with a studio in the Washington, D.C., area, tapped into the lab’s website for her work on a commission for a private residence in San Francisco.
</p><p>“I’ve been working on a project using visual information from the lab as base material for a sculptural translation,” she wrote in an email to SFML director Rikk Kvitek.
</p><p>“I really appreciate having online access to the amazing and beautiful information from your collaborative project. Thank you for making it available,” Boozer said. Images from the project can be seen on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/margaret.boozer/media_set?set=a.10204264225470795.1073741854.1382932060&amp;type=3">Facebook page</a>.
</p><p>Dr. Kvitek was delighted. "You are realizing a dream that I have always had, which is for a talented artist to see, interpret and use in their own work California's captivatingly beautiful natural landscape paterns that our seafloor mapping work has brought to light with sonar," he wrote to the artist.
</p><p>“I am glad to see our efforts are of value to the arts.”
</p><p>According to her <a href="http://margaretboozer.com">website</a>, Boozer’s work is included in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, the U.S. Department of State, and in many private collections. Recent projects include a commissioned installation at the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti and a chapter she wrote for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Soil and Culture publication. Recent exhibitions include Swept Away: Dust, Ashes and Dirt at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. <em>Photo from the artist's Facebook page</em>
