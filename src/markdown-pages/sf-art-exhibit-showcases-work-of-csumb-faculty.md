<p>A San Francisco art exhibit that invites spectators to take part by “dressing to transgress” features the work of CSU Monterey Bay faculty members.
</p><p>“<a href="http://www.somarts.org/glamorgeddonopens/">Glamorgeddon: The Spectacle</a>,” curated by Visual and Public Art Department professors Johanna Poethig, Dio Mendoza and Angelica Muro, is on display through Feb. 4 at the SOMArts Cultural Center.
</p><p>In Poethig’s words, the exhibit “celebrates how we choose to be fabulous, even as we critique the excesses of our own endangered species.”
</p><p>Poethig, a well&#45;known muralist and performance artist, has always been interested in the trappings of culture, media and advertising. “It was important for me to look more critically at product&#45;oriented culture and the ways media and the marketplace have placed a huge burden on us, especially women, to look and act a certain way,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle.
</p><p>Her own contribution to the show includes a series of bedazzled hard hats, which are available for spectators to pose with.
</p><p>The show features the work of more than 20 artists, including Dr. Amalia Mesa&#45;Bains, professor emerita at CSUMB and former chair of the Visual and Public Art Department. All works explore the concept of “glamour” via visual art, mixed media and performance.
</p><p>A series of <a href="http://www.somarts.org/limolectures/">30&#45;minute lectures</a> with some of the artists and scholars will be held on Jan. 30 – in a hot pink limousine.
</p><p>The <a href="http://www.somarts.org">SOMArts Cultural Center</a> is located at 934 Brannan St., between Eighth and Ninth streets, in San Francisco. The exhibit will close on Feb. 4.  Alumni John Elliott, Stephanie Sumler, Rachell Hester and Matt Florianni helped with the exhibit.
