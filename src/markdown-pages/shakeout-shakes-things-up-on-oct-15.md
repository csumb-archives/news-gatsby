<p>The Big One – it’s not a matter of “if,” Californians have been told. It’s a matter of “when.” At 10:16 on the morning of Oct. 15, members of the CSU Monterey Bay community are invited to join millions of people in this year’s Great California ShakeOut drill to prepare for the inevitable by practicing the drop, cover and hold on move.
</p><p>Drop, cover and hold on is a proven method for protecting yourself during an earthquake. Upon feeling the earth move it is recommended that you drop to the floor &#40;preferably under a substantial piece of furniture&#41;; cover your head and neck with your hands, a coat, book or other protective item; and hold there until the ground stops moving. When possible, stay clear of windows, tall un&#45;anchored furniture, or other items that present a hazard if they fall or break.
</p><p>After practicing drop, cover and hold on, participants are asked to evacuate their buildings to their outside assembly area.
</p><p>The University Police Department &#40;UPD&#41; will signal the start of the exercise with a test of CSUMB’s Otter Alert and other notification systems at approximately 10:15 a.m. At 10:21, an all&#45;clear broadcast will signal the end of the exercise.
</p><p>UPD encourages all community members to participate in the ShakeOut exercise. “As individuals, we’re all responsible for preparing ourselves for major incidents like an earthquake. If we’re prepared as individuals, we can be resources to help our community,” said Arianne Tucker, campus health and safety specialist. “If we’re caught unprepared, we’re more likely to be victims of the event.”
</p><p>The university’s Emergency Management Office also encourages the campus community to participate in the ShakeOut by:
</p><p>• Learning about earthquakes and the other hazards that threaten our communities.
</p><p>• Making a plan for what to do in an emergency.
</p><p>• Building a disaster survival kit.
</p><p>• Getting involved in opportunities to support community preparedness.
