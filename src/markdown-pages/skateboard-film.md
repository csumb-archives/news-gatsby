<h4>CSUMB students' skateboard film set to premiere</h4><p>"No Excuses, Just Hungry," a skateboarding film by a pair of California State University, Monterey Bay students, will have its debut showing on Dec. 7 in Salinas.
</p><p>Jared Nelson and Michael Oates-Kealey, students in the university's Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology, shot most of the footage in Salinas, Monterey, Marina and Seaside.
</p><p>The pair, both 21, worked on the film for three years. Capturing the fast-paced action was a real test of their filmmaking skills - some of the shots involved the filmmakers riding their own skateboards while holding the camera.
</p><p>Although the film was not a class assignment, Nelson and Oates-Kealey said their CSUMB courses strengthened their filmmaking skills.
</p><p>The film will be shown at 7 p.m., Dec. 7 at the Salinas Moose Lodge, 111 Monterey St. Admission is free.
