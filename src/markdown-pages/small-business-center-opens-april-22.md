<h3>New Salinas location convenient for more clients</h3><p>The CSU Monterey Bay Small Business Development Center will celebrate its grand opening at a new location in Salinas on Monday, April 22.
</p><p>From 2:30 to 5 p.m., the public is invited to the center, now located at 106 Lincoln Ave. CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa will attend along with Business School chair and director of the center Marylou Shockley, associate director Andrea Nield, the center’s counselors, local business owners and elected officials. The center opened in 2009 in a storefront in Gonzales. The move to Salinas makes it easier to serve the bulk of the center’s clients, 65 percent of whom come from that city. CSUMB’s center serves the area along the Highway 101 corridor from Gilroy and Hollister to King City and provides critical services to small business owners, helping them create jobs and solidify the local economy. Services compliment and expand on the services already being provided to Monterey and Santa Cruz counties’ coastal communities by the Central Coast SBDC hosted by Cabrillo College in Aptos. The centers help people develop business plans, secure financing, set up financial systems, plan for expansion, project cash flow, determine technology needs and provide a variety of other services helpful to small businesses. In addition to the free one-on-one consulting, the centers offer a variety of workshops and seminars.
