<p>From arts and culture year in review:
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay is adept at celebrating diversity with diversity. This one included a visit by Khleo Thomas, a teen idol who's acted with Nick Cannon and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, a discussion of the n-word, and a tag-team poetry du, one of whom worked with KRS-One. â€“ <em>Monterey County Weekly,</em> Dec. 18, 2014
