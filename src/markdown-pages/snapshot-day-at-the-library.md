</p><p>As part of the California Library Association's "Snapshot: One Day in the Life of California Libraries," CSU Monterey Bay joined others throughout the state – including 19 other CSU campuses – to gather statistics for a typical day.
</p><p>All information was collected for one day during the week of Oct. 4; CSUMB collected its data on Oct. 5.
</p><p>The information reflects the libraries' invaluable services and will be used to advocate for libraries in Sacramento in November. Insights gathered from "snapshot" data will also help the CSU libraries improve and enhance their collections and services, according to the CSU Chancellor's Office.
</p><p>On Oct. 5, nearly 3,700 people visited the Tanimura and Antle Family Memorial Library at CSUMB. Kathlene Hanson, the library's electronic resources coordinator who was in charge of gathering data, said that number needs to be put in context.
</p><p>It represents the total number of times people walked through the doors. "That includes everyone who used the building as a shortcut to get from the café side to the classroom side; and, it counts people who entered multiple times," she said. "Nevertheless, it's an impressive number."
</p><p>Perhaps more important is the number of times the library's website was accessed that day: 40,670. Nearly 400 people used the library's computers, and another 600 used their own computers in the building.
</p><p>Despite today's transition to digital media, the American Library Association reports that visits to college libraries are on the rise – partly due to the fact that academic libraries are adapting to meet students' changing needs.
</p><p>University libraries are unique. Not only do they foster research and innovation, they prepare students to enter the knowledge&#45;based workforce upon graduation.
</p><p>Support for academic success is the primary mission of the CSUMB library. It's student&#45;centered, with student&#45;friendly spaces for study, for group work, and for co&#45;curricular programs. It's an active social space &#40;with a café and outdoor patio&#41; that supports student learning.
</p><p>Like other modern libraries, the one at CSUMB is collaborative, technology&#45;infused and adaptive to change. It's a place to get access to information in many formats and from many sources. Mobile access as well as "Ask a Librarian," a program that allows students to get help via instant messaging, are extending services beyond the physical walls of the building.
</p><p>Kim Bui&#45;Burton, California Library Association president and director of the Monterey Public Library, has pointed out that library usage is up across the state and demand is growing for books and other resources, knowledgeable staff assistance and computer/Internet access – despite budget cuts, reduced hours and programs.
</p><p>"Snapshot" statistics will demonstrate to decision makers the extent that students, other library users and future leaders rely on California libraries for critical services, resources and programs – "now, more than ever," Bui&#45;Burton said.
