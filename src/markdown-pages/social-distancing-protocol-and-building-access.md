  On Wednesday, April 8, 2020, CSUMB adjusted our operations and building access
  policies to comply with the
  <a href="https://www.co.monterey.ca.us/Home/Components/News/News/6199/1336"
    >expanded Monterey County shelter-at-home order</a
  >. Our primary concern must continue to be for the health and safety of the
  students, faculty, and staff at CSUMB. Everyone must take all necessary steps
  to protect themselves and our community, helping to slow the spread of the
  virus.
</p>
<p>
  If you are required to work on campus,
  <b>do not come to work if you are sick or symptomatic.</b> Symptoms of
  COVID-19 include:

  the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and
  help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to
  others.

<p>
  Campus officials are in the process of obtaining cloth face coverings to
  provide essential employees who would like to use them. Everyone is encouraged
  to use cloth face coverings.

    continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first
    responders</b

</p>
<h4>Building access and sanitization</h4>
<p>
  All regularly occupied buildings use additional measures to protect the public
  health, including:
</p>
<p>
  To protect our community,
  <b>only essential personnel are permitted to access buildings.</b> Only the
  University President or a Vice President may authorize building access, and
  all building entrants must be arranged in advance. If you need to access a
  building for an essential reason, you must seek prior approval and make an
  appointment for building entry with a designated essential staff member of the
  appropriate division.
</p>
<p>
  We appreciate your continued vigilance and flexibility as we adjust our
  practices to enhance our public health efforts.
