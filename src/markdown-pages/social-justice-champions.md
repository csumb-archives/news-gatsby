<p><b>Andrea Diaz Aquino, Collaborative Health and Human Services </b></p>
<p><i>Outstanding Senior Award for Social Justice</i></p>
<p>
  When Andrea Diaz Aquino arrived at CSUMB in 2014 as an undocumented student,
  she felt alone with nowhere to go for support or help with questions about
  financial aid and legal issues. Aquino became a driving force of positive
  change, helping to create a community, support and services for undocumented
  students. She co-founded the Undocu-Otters &amp; Allies (UOA) student group,
  and served as its first president for two years.
</p>
<p>
  “We created spaces to give people their voice in order to tell stories and not
  be afraid to stand our ground,” Aquino said. “We promoted a lasting
  institutional change that would hopefully increase the small percentage of
  undocumented students graduating from higher education because of the support
  they receive.”
</p>
<p>
  In its first year, UOA established itself as a social group and successfully
  promoted a social change agenda. The group collaborated with the
  Undocu-Coalition, a faculty and staff group, to raise awareness and support
  for undocumented students.
</p>
<p>
  Their advocacy resulted in the creation of a full-time Undocu-Success Resource
  Specialist position, an
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/undocumentedstudents"
    >Undocu-Success Support website</a
  >, yearly Undocu-Success conferences, special graduation ceremonies for
  undocumented students, and Undocu-Ally trainings for faculty and staff. As of
  March 2020, 133 faculty and staff have completed the training.
</p>
<p>
  In the community, the group collaborated with local schools to give
  presentations about their immigration journeys and to hold workshops about
  pathways to higher education.
</p>
<p>
  “We have established a foundation for future generations to build upon in
  order to make a bigger change,” Aquino said. “I would have never imagined
  being open about my immigration status and empowering others to use their
  voices to make a change. UOA makes me hopeful about our impact on the future.
  It makes me believe that I will find people who will continue to challenge the
  system without fear, because I have learned that I am unafraid and
  unapologetic.”
</p>
<p>
  Pamela Motoike, a professor with CSUMB’s
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/service/">Service Learning Institute</a>, nominated
  Aquino for the Social Justice Award: “In my 19 years at CSUMB, I can think of
  no other student who better exemplifies the spirit of this award,” Motoike
  said.
</p>
<p>
  “Over her academic career, (Andrea) has made multiple contributions to
  projects that promote equity, including her work as a Service Learning student
  leader, her capstone work in promoting oral health in Latino communities, and
  her outstanding work in advocating for services and increased visibility of
  undocumented students at CSUMB.”
</p>
<p>
  Motoike praised Aquino for her growth as a leader and her commitment to social
  justice throughout her academic career.
</p>
<p>
  “From each experience, she takes the skills to communicate across cultures, to
  raise awareness of the issues of the marginalized, and to create change,”
  Motoike said. “With her background in social justice, community empowerment,
  and curriculum development, Andrea will be a powerful force for equity and
  social justice and an exemplar of leadership of which CSUMB can be proud.”
</p>
<p><b>Juan Pacheco Marcial, Psychology</b></p>
<p><i>Alumni Vision Award</i></p>
<p>
  Growing up undocumented in a low-income, rural town in South Monterey County,
  Juan Pacheco Marcial never imagined he’d go to college. Now he has not only
  earned a bachelor’s degree, he’s been accepted to a doctoral program in
  Chichanx Studies at UC Santa Barbara and aspires to a career in higher
  education.
</p>
<p>
  “My journey at CSUMB has not just revolved around a degree, but also the
  unique experiences that I’ve gained through mentorship, community,
  friendships, and values gained. The uniqueness of CSUMB is that faculty and
  staff are willing to go out of their ways to help out and make sure that you
  obtain the best education there is,” Marcial said.
</p>
<p>
  Mrinal Sinha, associate professor and psychology department chair, said
  Marcial embodies
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/about/founding-vision-statement/"
    >CSUMB’s Vision Statement</a
  >
  “in tangible and concrete ways” and “is the type of student CSUMB was designed
  to serve.”
</p>
<p>
  In addition, “he has provided leadership in a multi-cultural project or
  activity that extended the Vision into the lives of others, especially in the
  areas of bridging social/economic divides, celebrating diversity, and
  promoting understanding and respect for other cultures.”
</p>
<p>
  Before coming to CSUMB, Marcial said he hid his undocumented status, struggled
  with his identity and never fit it. He even attempted to take his own life. At
  CSUMB he discovered the UOA group at an event on campus, and everything
  changed.
</p>
<p>
  “It was a tough time for undocumented students. We were being targeted once
  more, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival was rescinded by the
  president. I knew that I had to get involved and change things. I was tired of
  running away from my identity and became a voice for others,” Pacheco said.
</p>
<p>
  Pacheco joined UOA and served as vice president. He organized the first
  undocumented student graduation ceremony, now an annual event. He described
  that first ceremony as “truly magical.”
</p>
<p>
  “Seeing all of the faces, full of teary eyes and huge smiles, made all of the
  work and stress that came along preparing for the graduation worth it.
  Watching the many families give their graduates huge strong hugs while having
  the proudest expressions on their faces, helped me dream of my own
  graduation,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  Marcial also worked at the<a href="https://csumb.edu/oc3/">
    Otter Cross Cultural Center (OC3)</a
  >
  for three years, where he received training about diversity, equity, and
  social justice and then gave presentations and helped lead workshops.
</p>
<p>
  In Sinha’s research lab, Marcial took on a leadership role, collaborating with
  a team of students on two projects which examined social psychological
  phenomena with Latinx students at CSUMB. He coordinated an interview project
  and prepared proposals that were accepted by three professional associations
  for presentations at regional and national conferences.
</p>
<p>
  As Marcial prepares for the next step in his academic career, he reflected on
  the dramatic impact of his time at CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  “Never once before CSUMB did I have a conversation regarding identities or
  differences in beliefs. There was no conversation about gender, race, or
  social status. In my three years here at CSUMB, these types of conversations
  are surrounding my life,” he said.
</p>
<p>
  “Because of the training received here that aligns with the Vision Statement,
  I have been able to focus my research, scholarship, and graduate school
  aspirations on these types of conversations. They have changed my life. I have
  been able to find myself.”
