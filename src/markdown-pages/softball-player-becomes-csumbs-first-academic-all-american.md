<h4>Jamie Moon named to the Capital One Academic All-America® third team</h4><p>By Kevin Gilmore
</p><p>Apparently, the 2012 season couldn't end until the California State University, Monterey Bay women's softball team broke new ground one last time. Once again, it is senior centerfielder Jamie Moon of Torrance doing the honors.
</p><p>Moon became the first student-athlete in the history of the Cal State Monterey Bay athletics program to earn Academic All-America® honors by being named to the Capital One Academic All-America® Softball team as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).
</p><p>The award is based on academic and athletic achievement, two areas in which Moon excelled as an Otter. In the classroom, the kinesiology major compiled a 3.57 grade point average and graduated with honors earlier this month. On the field, Moon hit .407 with a school-record 22 doubles, 51 runs and 50 RBI.
</p><p>Moon was the only player from the CCAA or the NCAA Division II West Region to earn the distinction for 2012.
</p><p>“When I think of the awards Jamie has received over the years, this is the pinnacle,” says CSUMB Coach Andrea Kenney. “She loved softball and took great pride in her academics. I am so happy she has been recognized for her commitment on the field and in the classroom. She is a true-athlete.”
</p><p>The Academic All-American® award is the fifth major award for Moon this spring. Included among those accolades were selection to the All-CCAA first team in April and the All-America third team by the National Fastpicth Coaches Association.
</p><p>“Playing collegiate softball has been an experience I will never forget,” Moon said. “To go out with an accolade such as this is incredible. I am extremely proud and hope to be as successful in nursing as I was in softball.”
