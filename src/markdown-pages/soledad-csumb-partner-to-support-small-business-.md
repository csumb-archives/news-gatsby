</p><p>The city of Soledad and CSU Monterey Bay's Small Business Development Center will open an outreach office in the Lum Building at 749 Front St. The community is invited to the center's grand opening at noon on July 7. 
</p><p>"Together, we'll work to offer strong support to the businesses in our community and strengthen their sustainability," said Soledad Mayor Richard V. Ortiz.   
</p><p>The new Small Business Development Center at Soledad will provide critical services to that city's small business community.  During a SBDC visit, entrepreneurs, startup companies and even seasoned firms can confidentially discuss and review business strategies.  Quality advice and support are available to help start and/or grow a small business, learn how to apply for a SBA loan, access market research, develop business plans, set up accounting systems, project cash flow needs, determine technology requirements, assist with selling products and services to the government and help access a myriad of resources and services â€“ all intended to open a world of opportunity to Soledad businesses. 
</p><p>"The SBDC has demonstrated its ability to support and promote increased economic growth," said Dr. Marylou Shockley, chair of CSUMB's School of Business.  "It offers vital support and training and is a natural addition to our efforts to help area and regional businesses. The university is well-positioned to provide leadership to the region's small businesses."   
</p><p>Entrepreneurs often find that discussing questions in a confidential and unbiased setting can help identify and clarify key decisions. Appointments can be made online at <a href="http://csumb.edu/sbdc">csumb.edu/sbdc</a> or by calling Ana Martinez at 675-7232.
</p><p>The center provides services at various locations from Gilroy and Hollister to King City.  Ms. Martinez can coordinate client services with the appropriate outreach office.
