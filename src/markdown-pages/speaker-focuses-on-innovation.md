<h3>Lumina Foundation executive visits CSUMB April 25</h3><p>The President’s Speaker Series at California State University, Monterey Bay continues April 25, when Jamie Merisotis of the Lumina Foundation visits campus.
</p><p>With the theme of “Disruptive Innovation in Higher Education,” the series focuses on the challenges facing higher education in an era of increased demand, changing demographics and declining state support. The speaker series brings nationally recognized leaders in education theory, innovation and policy to campus to discuss these issues.
</p><p>Mr. Merisotis is an expert on a wide range of higher-education issues. He is president and CEO of Lumina Foundation, the nation’s largest private foundation committed solely to enrolling and graduating more students from college. Long a champion of the idea that higher education enhances both society and individuals, he has worked for decades to increase educational opportunity among low-income, minority and other historically underrepresented populations.
</p><p>Under his leadership, Lumina has embraced an ambitious and specific goal: to ensure that, by 2025, 60 percent of Americans hold high quality degrees and credentials – up from the current level of less than 40 percent. All of Lumina’s efforts and activities – grant making, communication, evaluation, policy advocacy and convening – work toward achieveing that goal.
</p><p>His talk will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater, followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by CSUMB Provost Kathy Cruz-Uribe. The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue near A Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
