</p><p>– Dr. Julie Altman, program director
</p><p><strong>CSUMB goes green</strong>
</p><p>People across campus are working on many fronts to make Cal State Monterey Bay a more sustainable university. We developed a Climate Action Plan that will provide a road map for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and issues surrounding sustainability are addressed in many classes. We also have a robust alternative transportation program in place. Mike Lerch of campus facilities can speak to the many energy efficiency upgrades on campus (that have cut our energy use 20% and reduced our carbon footprint).
</p><p>– Mike Lerch, CSUMB’s associate director of facilities services and operations
</p><p><strong>Research at CSUMB: Why We Do It and What it Means for the Monterey Bay region</strong>
</p><p>Researchers at the university bring in millions of dollars in grants. Those funds create jobs and support the development of new knowledge. We’re eager to discuss economic development and to share ideas for cooperation and collaboration between the university and industry.
</p><p>–  University administrator
</p><h3>Science, Math, Computing</h3><p><strong>From ‘You’ve Got to be Kidding!’ to ‘Ah-Ha!’ – Hope for our oceans through insight and innovation</strong>
</p><p>The talk discusses innovative ways to address the unprecedented threats of climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification, pollution, fishery declines, coastal erosion, algal blooms and storm intensification on the coastal oceans and communities.
</p><p>– Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><p><strong>Peeling Back the Blue: How we Map and Use 3D Visualization to Reveal and Learn from Earth’s Hidden Seafloor Landscapes</strong>
</p><p>Although the global ocean is the driver of weather, a highway for marine commerce, a reservoir of vast marine resources, and our playground, we know more about distant planets than we do about the seafloor. Imagine if the next time you were standing at the ocean's edge that instead of watching crashing waves, you were able to visualize submarine canyons, underwater seamounts and ridges, and even a kelp forest teeming with marine life. The State of California has undertaken a cutting-edge project to make this possible by mapping the seafloor of all the state's waters. Dr. Kvitek will show you the first images created from this effort and share with you how this new information is already being used in a multitude of ways.
</p><p>– Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><p>Dr. Kvitek is a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, where he directs the CSUMB Seafloor Mapping Lab. He earned a bachelor’s degree in zoology from the University of Michigan, a master’s at Moss Landing Marine Labs, and Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Washington. His research with whales, sea otters, walrus, sea birds, fish, icebergs, submarine canyons and numerous invertebrates from the Arctic to the Antarctic has brought novel insights to the fields of benthic ecology, seafloor disturbance, habitat mapping and species relations, and the effects of harmful algal bloom toxins in marine foodchains. Beginning with SCUBA, Dr. Kvitek quickly realized that detailed bird’s-eye views of the seafloor could do for marine research what aerial photography had done for terrestrial studies, and now specializes in bringing seafloor habitats to life with high resolution remote sensing and 3D visualization
</p><p><strong>San Clemente Dam Removal</strong>
</p><p>San Clemente Dam has been removed from the Carmel River to reduce the risk of dam failure and to foster the historic salmon run.  This large-scale project has long-term impacts on the watershed, and could be a model for other dam removal projects in California.
</p><p>– Dr. Doug Smith
</p><p><strong>Water Resources on the Monterey Peninsula</strong>
</p><p>People on the coast between Carmel and Seaside have been seeking a sustainable water resource for decades. The search has been fraught with technical, political and legal pitfalls. What are the technical solutions? What are the political/legal constraints? What's the latest plan?
</p><p>– Dr. Doug Smith
</p><p><strong>The Geology of Coastal Monterey County: Resource Opportunities and Geological Hazards</strong>
</p><p>Wherever you stand, there is a stack of rocks below your feet that records the local geological history and governs the kind of urban development that is suited to the region. We will consider the water resources and environmental hazards of our region. Water is scarce, and urban expansion is locally constrained by coastal erosion, landslides and hill slope erosion potential.
</p><p>– Dr. Doug Smith
</p><p><strong>Institute for Applied Marine Ecology (IfAME)</strong>
</p><p>The primary goal of the IfAME is to provide science in support of government decision-making ranging from local municipalities to state, federal and international governments. That science includes monitoring the new state marine protected areas along California's coast, exploring the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries from Monterey to New England, studying the impact of commercial bottom trawling on seafloor habitats around the world, and diving from the world's only undersea laboratory in the Florida Keys. The closely linked secondary goal is to involve CSUMB students in the conduct of this research.
</p><p>– Dr. James Lindholm
</p><p><strong>Math, Revealed – Cracking the Mysteries of Math for Youngsters</strong>
</p><p>New research examining thousands of students in two dozen California school districts finds that students already doing well in math in the seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math courses in high school and meet college entrance requirements. But for many students who struggle with math in grade seven, there is no clear path to learning and achievement. CSUMB math professor Hongde Hu uses math games, engaging presentations and curriculum he has been refining for years to reach those youngsters.
</p><p>– Dr. Hongde Hu
</p><p><strong>Technology in the Classroom</strong>
</p><p>Technology is being used to expand curriculum options, maximize scarce resources, increase teacher and student engagement, and improve outcomes. It delivers a new type of interactive education to meet the needs and requirements of 21st century learners as global citizens. Dr. Bude Su has a particular interest in encouraging technology education as part of the K-12 curriculum and encouraging women/girls in STEM fields as well.
</p><p>– Dr. Bude Su
</p><h3>Psychology</h3><p><strong>Eyewitness Memory</strong>
</p><p>Eyewitnesses are notoriously bad in the identification of the perpetrator of a crime. If you witness a crime, can you be sure that your memory for that event is accurate? Not really. Scientific evidence explains that memory changes over time, is malleable and is easy to manipulate via suggestibility and misattribution. Find out why eyewitnesses are so bad at remembering details of the crime and in the identification of the perpetrator.
</p><p>– Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><p><strong>Creating Memories for Events that Never Happened</strong>
</p><p>False memories are the remembering of events that never took place. Memory is easily manipulated and can change without our awareness. Memory research shows that it is easy to create false memories (for example, a memory of getting lost in the mall). One of the issues with false memory is that you cannot tell the difference between a false memory and a real one.
</p><p>– Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><p><strong>They All Look the Same: The Other-Race Effect</strong>
</p><p>The other-race effect is a deficit in the ability to recognize or identify a face that is of a different race. You might hear a child say, “All of the faces look the same,” which is common response when looking at faces of an unfamiliar or different race. I examine what influences the other-race effect and what helps to minimize this effect.
</p><p>– Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h3>Human Development</h3><p><strong>Family Dynamics</strong>
</p><p>Dr. Rob Weisskirch, a professor of human development, can talk about a number of topics including:

</p><h3>Business</h3><p><strong>Developing Business Models for New Ventures</strong>
</p><p>The focus of creating new businesses has changed from writing a business plan to creating a business model. This talk tells what it takes to develop a killer business model - and how to do it.
</p><p>– Dr. Brad Barbeau
</p><p><strong>Funding for Startups – the ABC's</strong>
</p><p>New opportunities for raising funding are emerging in online crowdfunding.  When should a startup use angels, banks, and crowdfunding?  This talk covers the latest developments in venture funding and where they fit into the founder's toolkit for fundraising.
</p><p>– Dr. Brad Barbeau

</p><h3>Health</h3><p><strong>Kinesiology Gains in Popularity</strong>
</p><p>Kinesiology – the study of human movement – is the fastest-growing major on campuses across the country. As the U.S. population skews older – and fatter –there’s a demand for fitness trainers, physical therapists and researchers who study the science of movement and performance. Dr. Kent Adams, a prolific researcher as well as head of the Kinesiology Department, shares his findings to help people keep fit across the lifespan.
</p><p>– Dr. Kent Adams
</p><p><strong>Nursing Program will Meet a Need</strong>
</p><p>The health care industry is coping with the “silver tsunami” of aging baby boomers, combined with the impact of health care reform. Nurses will play a big role in meeting both challenges, but will need more than a two-year degree to do so. CSUMB has partnered with four community colleges in the region to offer a four-year degree that prepares them to serve as health care navigators, helping patients manage multiple conditions such as hypertension and diabetes outside a hospital setting. The university also offers currently employed nurses an opportunity to earn a B.S.N.
</p><p>– Dr. Savitri Singh-Carlson
</p><h3>Education</h3><p><strong>Unraveling Standardized Testing and Evaluation</strong>
</p><p>Mark O’Shea, a professor of education at CSUMB, has been studying the standards movement from the perspective of the classroom teacher for years. He has conducted extensive clinical research in standards-based education and has consulted with school districts and state departments of education. He can also talk about the new Common Core standards – he helped state officials develop the science standards – and their implementation in California.
</p><p>– Dr. Mark O’Shea

</p><h3>Science Illustration</h3><p><strong>Art in the service of science</strong>
</p><p>Science illustration is all around us – in books, magazines, posters, on websites, in films and TV, and in museums. Most of us don’t notice the extraordinary technical skill, the precision and carefully observed detail, or the beauty of these illustrations because we’re busy absorbing information from them. CSUMB is home to a nationally renowned science illustration program; graduates’ work is in the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History; in top science magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, Nature and Audubon; at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
