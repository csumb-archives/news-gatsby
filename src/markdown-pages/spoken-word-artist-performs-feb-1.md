<h2>Grand slam</h2><h3>Saul Williams kicks off Black History Month at CSUMB</h3><p>In celebration of Black History Month, spoken-word artist Saul Williams will perform at CSU Monterey at 7 p.m., Feb. 1, in the University Center ballroom.
</p><p>Williams has been called a “new-age hip-hop renaissance man” by the Fresno Bee. Esquire magazine called him the “Bob Marley of American poets.”
</p><p>He’s a slam poet, author, actor and a musician who raps and plays guitar. To young people across the country, he has defined poetry as an accessible, living art form; many view him as the catalyst for the spoken word movement and the advent of poetry slams.
</p><p>After graduating from Morehouse College with a bachelor’s degree in acting and philosophy, Williams moved to New York City to earn a master's degree in acting at New York University. There, he found himself at the center of the New York cafe poetry scene.
</p><p>He landed the lead role in the 1998 film Slam. Williams served as both a writer and actor on the film, which won the Sundance Festival Grand Jury Prize and the Camera D'Or prize at Cannes and introduced him to international audiences.
</p><p>He’s written three collections of poetry and has been published in the New York Times, Esquire and African Voices. His newest book, “The Dead Emcee Scrolls: The Lost Teachings of Hip-Hop,” recounts the history of that genre. As a poet and musician, Williams has toured and lectured around the world, appearing at many universities and colleges.
</p><p>Admission is $5 and tickets can be purchased at the door. A $2 parking pass must be purchased as well. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
