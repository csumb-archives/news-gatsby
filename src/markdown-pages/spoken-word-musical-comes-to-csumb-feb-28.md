<p>In celebration of Black History Month, NuBiAh, a Broadway-caliber musical, will be staged at CSU Monterey Bay’s World Theater on Feb. 28 at 7 p.m.
</p><p>NuBiAh is a spoken-word musical that dramatizes the history of African kings and queens, with an emphasis on the strong principles and character traits that made them legendary. The play is based on a bedtime story and a coloring book written by Tommy Jones. Jones is executive producer and artistic director of the stage play. His impetus for writing the musical was a desire to give African American children and young adults a keener sense of identity and self-worth. The play features original choreography, music, dance, and spoken-word poetry. The play aims to inspire the audience members to find their passion and follow their dream. The event is sponsored by CSUMB’s Otter Cross Cultural Center and Associated Students. The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue.  While the performance is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit for $2. <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">Driving directions and a campus map are available here</a>.
