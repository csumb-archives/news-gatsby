<h3>Future Monterey Bay; focus of speaker series</h3><p>“Innovators, upstarts and mythmakers: the deep origins of Silicon Valley” will be the topic addressed by Stanford professor Paul Saffo on Nov. 4, when the President’s Speaker Series returns to Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Saffo poses the question: Why does Silicon Valley produce one revolution after another? Conventional wisdom credits big visions, great management and a history of success. Conventional wisdom is wrong, he says. Silicon Valley’s unique edge is built on the rubble of failure, poor management and a crucial third ingredient that leads us to innovate relentlessly against the odds. According to Saffo, that crucial element is inextricably tied to the history of Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Saffo is a forecaster with more than two decades of experience in helping corporate and government clients understand and respond to the dynamics of large-scale, long-term change. He teaches at Stanford, where he is a consulting associate professor in the School of Engineering, and chairs the Future Studies track at Singularity University. He holds degrees from Harvard College, Cambridge and Stanford universities.
</p><p>His presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. A question-and-answer session and a public reception will follow. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here.</a>
</p><p>Should the theater reach capacity, a live simulcast will be available at the University Center, adjacent to the World Theater.
</p><p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling the World Theater box office at 582-4580, or <a href="http://csumb.edu/rsvp">online</a>.
</p><p>The theme of this year’s speaker series is “Future Monterey Bay.” During the school year, three speakers will visit campus to address various aspects of the theme.
</p><p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay’s role as a community resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought and action on issues important to our community.
