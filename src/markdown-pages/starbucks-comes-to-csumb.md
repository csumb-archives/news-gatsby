<p>Starbucks will soon be filling the cups of students, staff and faculty at CSU Monterey Bay from a location in the Student Center.
</p><p>The coffee shop's official opening is scheduled for Jan. 23 to coincide with the start of the spring semester. It will provide students with a comfortable place to gather, and feature standard Starbucks beverages and some food.
</p><p>“It will offer an assortment of hot breakfast items as well as yogurt parfaits and bistro boxes,” said Maria Garcia, director of operations for the University Corporation. It will also have assorted bakery items, including seasonal offerings such as pumpkin scones during the fall.
</p><p>Campus Dining Services will work with the Food Committee to give students the opportunity to help pick some of the food offerings, Garcia said. Meal plans will be accepted as payment, along with OtterBucks, credit/debit cards and Starbucks gift cards. A variety of seating will be included – a community table, a computer bar, traditional café/lounge seating and patio seating.
</p><p>Another attractive feature: the company’s commitment to environmental stewardship will be put into practice. That includes recycling and efforts to minimize energy consumption and water use. The decision to bring Starbucks to campus resulted from student feedback. Last semester, Dining Services surveyed students about their preferences for food options on campus. Focus groups and student interviews and surveys were conducted. “The results showed that Starbucks was the preferred brand in the coffee category,” Garcia said. The University Corporation is paying the renovation costs; Sodexo will be the licensee. Licensed stores, according to the Starbucks website, provide the “Starbucks Experience” in a variety of locations including grocery stores, hospitals, airports, department stores. They offer the same products and customer service as company-owned facilities. Starbucks at CSUMB will be open during the Student Center’s hours of operation.
