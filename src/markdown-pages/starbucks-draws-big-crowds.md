<p>A steady stream of customers lined up for lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and just plain coffee when Starbucks opened in the Student Center on Jan. 23. The newly redesigned space provides a comfortable place to gather, and offers the standard Starbucks beverage lineup and some food. Besides the traditional café seating, there’s a computer bar, and tables and chairs on a newly constructed patio. Meal plans are accepted as payment, along with OtterBucks, credit/debit cards and Starbucks gift cards.
</p><p>The grand opening is scheduled for 10 a.m., Feb. 15.
</p><p>The decision to bring Starbucks to campus resulted from student feedback. Last year, Dining Services surveyed students about their preferences for food options on campus. Focus groups and student interviews and surveys were conducted.??
</p><p>“The results showed that Starbucks was the preferred brand in the coffee category,” said Maria Garcia, director of operations for the University Corporation.
</p><p>The University Corporation covered the renovation costs; Sodexo, the university’s food-service provider, is the licensee. Licensed stores, according to the Starbucks website, provide the “Starbucks Experience” in a variety of locations including grocery stores, hospitals, airports, department stores. They offer the same products and customer service as company-owned facilities.??
</p><p>Starbucks at CSUMB is open during the Student Center’s hours of operation: Monday-Thursday, 7 a.m.-10 p.m.; Friday, 7 a.m.-8 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m.; Sunday, noon-10 p.m.
