<h4>Steppenwolf Theatre Company co-founder Jeff Perry joins forces with guest artists to educate the next generation at Summer Arts</h4><p>Trading the winds of Chicago for the gentler breezes of Monterey Bay, Jeff Perry, the celebrated co-founder of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, has again assembled a tremendous ensemble of artists for Steppenwolf Classes West – instructing, engaging and inspiring the next generation of artists enrolled in California State University Summer Arts.
</p><p>Perry brings tremendous performance experience as a member of Tony award-winning casts of <em>August: Osage County</em> and <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>. <em>August: Osage County</em> also secured a Pulitzer Prize.
</p><p>“The opportunity for our Summer Arts’ students to work with Jeff and members of the world-renowned Steppenwolf Theatre Company though their Steppenwolf Classes West program is truly remarkable,” said John Mayer, chair of the Theatre Department at CSU Stanislaus. “This once-in-a-lifetime experience deeply affects students as both collaborative artists and human beings.”
</p><p>The first Steppenwolf Classes West at CSU Summer Arts program was offered in 2002, when Perry, Sheldon Patinkin and Kim Rubenstein conducted a two-week intensive workshop coordinated by Mayer. Due to the success of the program and the student demand, the workshop was repeated in 2005, 2008, 2010 (as a month-long workshop), 2011 and now again for an entire month in 2013.

</p><p>On July 24, the Steppenwolf program will present the play <em>Tribes</em>, starring Perry, which had <a href="http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/theater/reviews/tribes-by-nina-raines-at-the-barrow-street-theater.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1373578403-Tjpo0TeR2B8l8DKVM6VIIg">a wonderful run in New York in 2012</a>; and, on July 20, the classic play <em>Love Letters</em>, featuring Evelyn Carol Case and Mayer.
</p><p>The Steppenwolf co-founder is not alone in distinction among CSU Summer Arts masters. This year, a cadre of celebrated guest artists is providing real-life perspective of their industry along with artistic instruction.
