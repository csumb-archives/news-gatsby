<h3>Classes start Aug. 22</h3><p>A few spots remain for the fall 2011 class of CSU Monterey Bay’s Master of Social Work program. Applications must be received by July 1.
</p><p>The three-year program provides an opportunity for people who are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is accessible and affordable.
</p><p>Students specialize in Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families, and prepare for a broad array of job opportunities within government and non-profits serving youth, the elderly, low-income families, veterans, those who face health challenges and others.
</p><p>Admission requirements and application materials are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/msw">here</a>.
</p><p>Potential students who are lacking a prerequisite – human biology and statistics are among the classes applicants must have already completed – are urged to take those classes as soon as possible. If the prerequisites will not be met by August, please consider applying for fall 2012 once the application window opens in October.
</p><p>Classes are currently offered in the evenings. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year.
