<h3>Free chamber music concert set for Dec. 6</h3><p>The community is invited to a free concert of chamber music at CSU Monterey Bay on Dec. 6.
</p><p>Since forming the Friction Quartet while they were students at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Doug Machiz, Kevin Rogers, Otis Harriel and Pei-Ling Lin have established a reputation for edgy programming and exhilarating performance of contemporary works.
</p><p>Recent performances include La Belle Vie Concert Series at the Legion of Honor, San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music’s Chamber Music Day, and Garrett-Moulton Productions’ A Show of Hands for quartet and dancers.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the quartet will premiere a piece composed by Dr. Lanier Sammons, a lecturer in the university’s <a href="http://mpa.csumb.edu/">Music and Performing Arts Department.</a>
</p><p>The performance will start at 8 p.m. in the Music Hall, located on Sixth Avenue between Col. Durham and Butler streets. Parking is available in front of the building.
</p><p>While the concert is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the adjacent lot or by going <a href="https://store.csumb.edu/products/daily-parking-permit">online</a>. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>Earlier in the day, the group will work with student composers, offering feedback on their compositions.
</p><p>For information or to request disability accommodations, call 582-3009.
</p><p>“To watch the Friction Quartet is to see the utter embodiment of the music. They are so fully there – connected – exchanging glances as their bodies move, dip, sway, as if they are not four different people.” – <em>Leslie Gossett, writing from the Creating Enlightened Society Festival</em>
