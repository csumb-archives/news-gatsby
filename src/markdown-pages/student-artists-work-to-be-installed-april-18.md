<p>A vital part of being an artist is entering works into juried competitions. Students at CSU Monterey Bay had the opportunity to do that, thanks to a generous donation from a faculty member.
</p><p>A call went out for site-specific entries to be displayed in the Otter Express and the University Center. Three works were selected for the E. Richard Brown Award for Excellence in Art. The winning artists – Jorge Amezcua, Lori Van Meter and Victor Veltran – received cash prizes and stipends to pay for materials. Their work will be displayed for a year.
</p><p>The three pieces will be installed on April 18. A reception and awards presentation is scheduled for 5 p.m., April 24, in the Visual and Public Art Department, Building 72.
</p><p>“During my time here on campus, I haven’t noticed much student art displayed,” said Dr. Brown, who teaches a First Year Seminar and service learning classes. “So I thought, what if I were to make a monetary award to motivate the students to become more active in art and all of us would have the benefit of seeing that art?"
</p><p>An experience he had while a student at UCLA motivated him to support the awards.
</p><p>“I remembered how powerful it was when I was at UCLA and won the Frank Sinatra Award for second-place pop vocalist,” he said. “So I contacted Lila Staples (chair of the Visual and Public Art Department)” to offer the donation.
</p><p>“It has brought incredible joy to my heart. My hope is that someone else will see what can be done and also give,” Dr. Brown said.
</p><p><strong>DETAILS:</strong>
</p><p>Proposals were solicited for three locations:
</p><p>• 3-D piece for display in the Otter Express rotunda. Award: $2,500
</p><p>• 3-D piece for the University Center lobby. Award: $2,500
</p><p>• 2-D piece for west wall in the Otter Express. Award: $1,000
</p><p>The pieces will be displayed for one year. Students retain ownership of them.
