<p>Student-athletes at CSU Monterey Bay got into the holiday spirit by making cards for military members serving overseas.
</p><p>“I think anytime we can find a way to thank our service men and women, we should jump at the opportunity,” said Angelina Orozco, an outfielder on the softball team and secretary of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.
</p><p>“These holiday cards were a small but personal and fun way for our SAAC reps to show that Otter Athletics supports our troops.” The cards will be sent to Soldiers’ Angels, a Pasadena-based nonprofit organization that supports members of the military.
</p><p>Soldiers' Angels began when military mom Patti Patton-Bader discovered that her son's fellow soldiers were not receiving the home-front support they needed. It quickly spread from a mom and her circle of friends supporting one Army unit with care packages, to a worldwide organization with hundreds of thousand of volunteers supporting American service members of every branch in a myriad of ways.
