<p>Led by members of the women’s soccer team, seven CSUMB squads produced team grade-point averages of 3.0 or higher for the spring semester.
</p><p>That’s in addition to producing two team titles, seven All-America selections, and a number of community service projects.
</p><p>The women soccer players compiled a 3.32 GPA to lead the university’s 12 intercollegiate sports programs. The women's cross country and golf teams each compiled a 3.17.
</p><p>Men’s soccer, women’s water polo and volleyball all earned GPAs of 3.06; women’s basketball came in at 3.04. “CSUMB student-athletes continue to be challenged – not only when they compete but also in the classroom,” said CSUMB Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.
</p><p>“And you know what? They are responding and they are responding well. Our GPA continues to improve.” Volleyball outside hitter Julia Ashen registered a perfect 4.0 while juggling a course load of 30 credits in her freshman year.
</p><p>Four other student-athletes recorded 4.0s for the spring semester: volleyball player Molly Kennedy; soccer players Dylan Niven and Kendra Gillo; and baseball player Brian Haggett. “Student-athletes are winning awards,” Otoupal said. “We are bringing home championships. We graduated 28 student-athletes this year and we will graduate even more next year – with better GPAs. Our coaches are doing a great job teaching and coaching. Our student-athletes are doing their jobs – in the classroom and in competition.” Softball player Jamie Moon became the first CSUMB student-athlete to earn Academic All-America honors.
