</p><p>Work by students at California State University, Monterey Bay as well as teenagers will be presented at the Carmel Short Cinema for Young Filmmakers event at the Forest Theater on June 26 at 8 p.m.
</p><p>Sponsored by the Forest Theater Guild and CSU Monterey Bay's Department of Teledramatic Arts and Technology, the screening is an encore presentation of work shown at last spring's Monterey Bay Film Festival as well as pieces created by university students for their senior projects, called capstones.
</p><p>Among the "shorts" – all are under 10 minutes – to be screened are music videos, documentaries, animation and narratives including iDance, an experimental and poetic film that follows two hip-hop dancers. It offers viewers a chance to experience life inside the hip-hop culture, and will leave people stunned, inspired and hopeful. The three-minute piece was created by CSUMB student Chris Marcos for his capstone project.
</p><p>All films are family-friendly (PG-13 content).
</p><p>Enid Baxter Blader, who teaches digital video at CSUMB, is the event's producer.
</p><p>Tickets are $10 and can be purchased at the door. Spectators are advised to wear warm clothing and may want to bring a blanket. Concessions will be available.
</p><p>The Forest Theater is located at the corner of Mountain View and Santa Rita streets near downtown Carmel.
