<h3>Annual event at Panetta Institute</h3><p>Duane Lindsay, CSU Monterey Bay’s student body president, attended the 13th annual Student Leadership Seminar at the Panetta Institute for Public Policy. The program was held June 17-23 on the CSUMB campus.
</p><p>Lindsay, a social and behavioral sciences major from Garden Valley, was elected Associated Students president in the spring of 2012 for the upcoming school year.
</p><p>He has been involved with student government since his first semester on campus, when he was an active member of the Associated Students environmental affairs committee and member of the Finance Board. That led to being elected AS environmental senator for the following two years (2009-2011). He has also served as residential housing association president, as well as in other leadership roles on campus.
</p><p>He joined 27 other student leaders from throughout the CSU system, Santa Clara University and Dominican University of California at the weeklong event.
</p><p>The objectives of the seminar, called Education for Leadership in Public Service, are to teach leadership principles, strategies and practices; to send the students back to their campuses and communities as more effective leaders; and to encourage them to pursue lives of public service.
</p><p>Following six days of seminars and exercises, the participants gave presentations on their personal perceptions of leadership and their plans to apply the lessons they learned to their academic, professional and political objectives.
</p><p>"I entered with an open mind, ready to grasp and learn from individuals who have been leaders all of their lives," Lindsay said at the conclusion of the seminar. "The energy that surrounded and inspired us all was extraordinary. The bonds and connections we took away from the seminar will impact our leadership as presidents in many ways."
</p><p>Institute director Sylvia Panetta explained why the seminar is important.
</p><p>“Today’s young generation will one day lead our cities, states and our nation,” she said. “They will be responsible for the future of our communities and our economy. “To prepare them for this work, it is essential that they be provided with strong examples of leadership so that they can learn and develop the skills they require to be the strong leaders our democracy needs.
</p><p>“The young people who attend this seminar have already demonstrated their ambition and desire to serve. The Panetta Institute’s Leadership Seminar is the next step on their path to becoming the future generation of leaders,” Mrs. Panetta said.
