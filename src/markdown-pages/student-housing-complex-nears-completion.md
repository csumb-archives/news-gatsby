<p>PROMONTORY SET TO OPEN IN THE FALL </p><p>Rising to the north of campus is a four&#45;story student housing complex, set to open in August. It's the first new housing build at CSU Monterey Bay is more than a decade.
</p><p>The Promontory will provide nearly 600 beds configured in 176 units in three buildings and will house sophomores, juniors and seniors, much like the North Quad complex.
</p><p>It offers single rooms in apartment&#45;style living; each bedroom has its own bathroom. Each unit includes a no&#45;pay washer and dryer, dishwasher, microwave, stove and refrigerator.
</p><p>“It filled up very quickly. It was in high demand,” Christine Erickson, CSUMB’s associate vice president of student affairs and dean of students, told the Monterey County Weekly.
</p><p>The eight&#45;acre site is located at Eighth Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, a short walk to the main campus. A pedestrian and bike pathway will link the Promontory to the campus core.
</p><p>The developer, AMCAL Equities of Agoura Hills, describes the design as “a modern exterior with varied materials and prominent corners.” Public spaces include a fitness center, a community room, landscaped courtyards, bicycle storage and basketball courts. A parking lot for approximately 330 cars is also included.
