<p>Rising to the north of campus is a four-story student housing project, set to open in the fall of 2015.
</p><p>As the student population at CSU Monterey Bay grows, so does the need for housing. When the project, called the Promontory at CSUMB, comes online, it will provide nearly 600 beds configured in 176 units in three buildings. While a final decision has yet to be made, it is likely the Promontory will house juniors and seniors, much like the North Quad complex.
</p><p>The eight-acre site is located at Eighth Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, a short walk to the main campus. A maintenance shop used by the military for small arms and vehicle repair occupied the site and was demolished as part of the project.
</p><p>AMCAL Equities of Agoura Hills, the developer, describes the design as “a modern exterior with varied materials and prominent corners.” Plans are not yet finalized for how the public spaces will be used, but they may include a fitness center, a community room, a landscaped courtyard, barbecue areas and bicycle storage. A parking lot for 400 cars is also included.
