<p>The Speakers Bureau provides speakers at no cost to service clubs, schools, senior centers, and other groups in the local area.</p><p>Booking a speaker is easy. Just e-mail your request to the CSUMB Public Information Officer.</p><p>CSUMB faculty and staff members are currently offering talks on the following topics:</p><h4>Research at CSUMB: Why we do it and what it means for the Monterey Bay region</h4><p>Researchers at the university bring in millions of dollars in grants. Those funds create jobs and support the development of new knowledge. We’re eager to discuss economic development and to share ideas for cooperation and collaboration between the university and industry.
</p><p>Presented by a university administrator.
</p><h4>From ‘You’ve got to be kidding!’ to ‘Ah-ha!’ – hope for our oceans through insight and innovation</h4><p>The talk discusses innovative ways to address the unprecedented threats of climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification, pollution, fishery declines, coastal erosion, algal blooms and storm intensification on the coastal oceans and communities.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><h4>Peeling back the blue: how we map and use 3D visualization to reveal and learn from Earth’s hidden seafloor landscapes</h4><p>Although the global ocean is the driver of weather, a highway for marine commerce, a reservoir of vast marine resources, and our playground, we know more about distant planets than we do about the seafloor. Imagine if the next time you were standing at the ocean's edge that instead of watching crashing waves, you were able to visualize submarine canyons, underwater seamounts and ridges, and even a kelp forest teeming with marine life. The State of California has undertaken a cutting&#45;edge project to make this possible by mapping the seafloor of all the state's waters. Dr. Kvitek will show you the first images created from this effort and share with you how this new information is already being used in a multitude of ways.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Rikk Kvitek
</p><h4>Science with a mission at CSUMB</h4><p>The CSUMB Science Division includes experts from both terrestrial and marine realms. Their common mission is to use sound science to solve environmental problems in the tri&#45;county area. They use cutting&#45;edge technology and student power for the good of the community.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>San Clemente Dam removal</h4><p>San Clemente Dam will be removed from the Carmel River to reduce the risk of dam failure and to foster the historic salmon run. This large&#45;scale project will have long&#45;term impacts on the watershed, and could be a model for other dam removal projects in California.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>Water resources on the Monterey Peninsula</h4><p>People on the coast between Carmel and Seaside have been seeking a sustainable water resource for decades. The search has been fraught with technical, political and legal pitfalls. What are the technical solutions? What are the political/legal constraints? What's the latest plan?
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>The geology of coastal Monterey county: resource opportunities and geological hazards</h4><p>Wherever you stand, there is a stack of rocks below your feet that records the local geological history and governs the kind of urban development that is suited to the region. We will consider the water resources and environmental hazards of our region. Water is scarce, and urban expansion is locally constrained by coastal erosion, landslides and hill slope erosion potential.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith
</p><h4>Institute For Applied Marine Ecology (IFAME)</h4><p>The primary goal of the IfAME is to provide science in support of government decision&#45;making ranging from local municipalities to state, federal and international governments. That science includes monitoring the new state marine protected areas along California's coast, exploring the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries from Monterey to New England, studying the impact of commercial bottom trawling on seafloor habitats around the world, and diving from the world's only undersea laboratory in the Florida Keys. The closely linked secondary goal is to involve CSUMB students in the conduct of this research.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. James Lindholm
</p><h4>Math, revealed – Cracking the mysteries of math for youngsters</h4><p>New research examining thousands of students in two dozen California school districts finds that students already doing well in math in the seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math courses in high school and meet college entrance requirements. But for many students who struggle with math in grade seven, there is no clear path to learning and achievement. CSUMB math professor Hongde Hu uses math games, engaging presentations and curriculum he has been refining for years to reach those youngsters.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Hongde Hu
</p><h4>Innovation in higher education</h4><p>Higher education is facing challenges in an era of increased demand, changing demographics and declining state support. American colleges and universities will need to adopt new educational approaches and technologies to serve more students while maintaining quality. CSUMB is addressing this through a variety of ways: a new three&#45;year computer science degree developed in partnership with Hartnell College; creation of an Institute for Innovation and Economic Development; and exploring the potential to use technology for online programs.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Eric Tao
</p><h4>Eyewitness memory</h4><p>Eyewitnesses are notoriously bad in the identification of the perpetrator of a crime. If you witness a crime, can you be sure that your memory for that event is accurate? Not really. Scientific evidence explains that memory changes over time, is malleable and is easy to manipulate via suggestibility and misattribution. Find out why eyewitnesses are so bad at remembering details of the crime and in the identification of the perpetrator.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>Creating memories for events that never happened</h4><p>False memories are the remembering of events that never took place. Memory is easily manipulated and can change without our awareness. Memory research shows that it is easy to create false memories &#40;for example, a memory of getting lost in the mall&#41;. One of the issues with false memory is that you cannot tell the difference between a false memory and a real one.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>They all look the same: the other-race effect</h4><p>The other&#45;race effect is a deficit in the ability to recognize or identify a face that is of a different race. You might hear a child say, “All of the faces look the same,” which is common response when looking at faces of an unfamiliar or different race. I examine what influences the other&#45;race effect and what helps to minimize this effect.
</p><p>Presented by  Dr. Jill Yamashita
</p><h4>A vision for service: At CSUMB, giving back is a core value</h4><p>CSUMB has won national acclaim for integrating community service with each student’s academic experience, and is changing lives – and our ideas about learning and community – in the process
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Seth Pollack
</p><h4>Mexican entrepreneurs: a new look to immigration</h4><p>Immigrants aren’t always who you think they are.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Juan Gutierrez
</p><h4>Creating customer loyalty</h4><p>John Avella, head of CSUMB’s hospitality program, has 40 years of human resource development and teaching experience in the hospitality industry. He has been vice president of human resources for Marriott Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the World, and president of Human Resource Concepts. His work focused on management and executive development, Customer service and organizational strategic change. He has studied the application of emotional intelligence to customer service/loyalty, emotional labor and leadership. He has developed a process that teaches people to “connect” to the customer.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>The region’s hospitality industry – what’s ahead?</h4><p>The lingering effects of the recession and looming water problems are just two issues facing the local tourism/hospitality industry. What’s on the horizon?
</p><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>Sustainable hospitality management</h4><p>Presented by Dr. John Avella
</p><h4>Kinesiology gains in popularity</h4><p>Kinesiology – the study of human movement – is the fastest&#45;growing major on campus. As the U.S. population skews older – and fatter – there’s a demand for fitness trainers, physical therapists and researchers who study the science of movement and performance. Dr. Kent Adams, a prolific researcher as well as head of the kinesiology department, shares his findings to help people keep fit across the lifespan.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Kent Adams
</p><h4>Nursing program will meet a need</h4><p>The health care industry is coping with the “silver tsunami” of aging baby boomers, combined with the impact of health care reform. Nurses will play a big role in meeting both challenges, but will need more than a two&#45;year degree to do so. CSUMB has partnered with four community colleges in the region to offer a four&#45;year degree that prepares them to serve as health care navigators, helping patients manage multiple conditions such as hypertension and diabetes outside a hospital setting.
</p><p>Presented by Marianne Hultgren
</p><h4>Unraveling standardized testing and evaluation</h4><p>Mark O’Shea, a professor education at CSUMB, has been studying the standards movement from the perspective of the classroom teacher for years. He has conducted extensive clinical research in standards&#45;based education and has consulted with school districts and state departments of education. He can also talk about the new Common Core standards – he helped state officials develop the science standards – and their implementation in California.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Mark O’Shea
</p><h4>Digging through time</h4><p>Dr. Ruben Mendoza is an archaeologist, writer, and photographer who has explored the length and breadth of Mexico, Central America, Europe, and the U.S. Southwest documenting both pre&#45;Columbian and Colonial era sites and collections. He has directed major archaeological investigations and conservation projects at missions San Juan Bautista, Carmel, and Nuestra Señora de la Soledad, among others. Recent efforts at the Royal Presidio of Monterey resulted in the tandem discovery of the earliest Serra era Christian houses of worship in California dated to 1770 and 1771. And he has made astronomically and liturgically significant discoveries of solstice, equinox, and feast day solar illuminations of mission church altars throughout California, the U.S. Southwest, and Mesoamerica.

</p><h4>Summer arts</h4><p>Sword fights, improvisational comedy, animation, painting: Summer school was never this much fun. Several hundred students – high school, college, and adult members of the local community – come to the university in July for the annual CSU Summer Arts program. The longtime CSU program relocated to CSUMB in the summer of 2012 for a five&#45;year run. The program includes a couple of dozen public events, including lectures, readings, concerts and theatrical productions – in other words, the area’s summer arts scene has gotten a lot more interesting.
</p><p>Presented by Dr. Ilene Feinman
</p><h4>CSUMB goes green</h4><p>People across campus are working on many fronts to make Cal State Monterey Bay a more sustainable university. We developed a Climate Action Plan that will provide a road map for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and Issues surrounding sustainability are addressed in many classes. We've also have a robust alternative transportation program in place. Mike Lerch, CSUMB's Manager of Energy and Utilities, can speak to the many energy efficiency upgrades on campus &#40;that have cut our energy use 20% and reduced our carbon footprint.
</p><p>Presented by Mike Lerch, CSUMB’s associate director of facilities services and operations
</p><h4>Art in the service of science</h4><p>Science illustration is all around us – in books, magazines, posters, on websites, in films and TV, and in museums. Most of us don’t notice the extraordinary technical skill, the precision and carefully observed detail, or the beauty of these illustrations because we’re busy absorbing information from them. CSUMB is home to a nationally renowned science illustration program; graduates’ work is in the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History; in top science magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, Nature and Audubon; at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

More news and events, campus pics, and social chatter among students and university folk.</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay has an active and engaged faculty, staff and student body, and we love interactive ways to connect and share information online. The university encourages its faculty, staff and students to use tools such as social media to advance their work and heighten their experience as members of the campus community.
</p><p>In an effort to give direction when using social media, University Communications has developed the following guidelines. These guidelines are not intended for Internet activities that do not associate or identify a faculty or staff member with CSUMB, do not use CSUMB email addresses, do not discuss CSUMB and are purely about personal matters.
</p><h2>What is social media?</h2><p>We consider social media any technology tool or online space for integrating and sharing user&#45;generated content in order to engage in conversations. These guidelines do not attempt to name every current and emerging platform, but some examples are Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Instagram.
</p><h3>If you post/manage a social media account on behalf of Cal State Monterey Bay:</h3><p><strong>Be connected.</strong> If you have been authorized by your supervisor to create a CSUMB social media site or a video for posting in locations such as YouTube, please contact University Communications for an approved logo and other images and to ensure coordination with other CSUMB sites and content. Social media channels are not considered official unless they are developed or authorized by University Communications, which maintains and publicizes a list of all official university social media channels.
</p><p>As the administrator of a CSUMB social media channel, you accept the responsibility for maintaining current and accurate content and monitoring and moderating posts to that channel, including deleting comments and posts that do not meet the criteria set forth in these guidelines.
</p><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> As a CSUMB employee or representative, you should be mindful of the university’s public mission as a forum for thoughtful discussion of opposing ideas. Some online communities can be volatile, tempting users to behave in ways they otherwise wouldn’t. Your reputation, and CSUMB's, are best served when you remain above the fray.
</p><p><strong>Be responsive.</strong> If a question or comment is directed toward you via your social media site or page, you should do your best to reply in a timely and appropriate fashion. If the comment is a complaint or critique, follow these tips to resolve the situation: <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/7&#45;tips&#45;for&#45;dealing&#45;with&#45;upset&#45;facebook&#45;fans/">http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/7&#45;tips&#45;for&#45;dealing&#45;with&#45;upset&#45;faceboo...</a>
</p><p><strong>Be transparent.</strong> If you participate in or maintain a social media site on behalf of the university, clearly state your role and goals. Discuss with your supervisor when you are empowered to respond directly to users and when you may need approval.
</p><p><strong>Be thoughtful.</strong> Before you jump into a discussion thread or respond to a posting, think about the implications. Will your response stimulate positive discussion, provide new information or insight, or inflame? If you have any questions about whether it’s appropriate to enter into a social media discussion or write about certain kinds of material in your role as a CSUMB employee, ask your supervisor before you post or contact University Communications.
</p><p><strong>Know the rules.</strong> Comply with FERPA, the CSUMB honor code and policies related to Conflict of Interest, Privacy, Security, Safety, Intellectual Property, Computing and Technology Resources, and Human Resources. Become familiar with the terms of service and policies of sites and networks in which you participate. Pay attention to updates. If the legal language is hard to follow, follow a respected blogger or two who discuss service changes in their posts.
</p><p>You are responsible for gaining the expressed consent of all involved parties for the right to distribution or publication of recordings, photos, images, video, text, slideshow presentations, artwork and advertisements whether those rights are purchased or obtained without compensation.
</p><p><strong>Keep your personal views separate</strong>. Uphold the university’s mission and values in your activities. Don’t include political or personal comments. This includes changes to your photo or avatar in relation to political or social issues. Do not use CSUMB's name to promote or endorse any product, cause, or political party or candidate.
</p><h3>Personal site guidelines</h3><p><strong>Be authentic</strong>. Be honest about your identity. In personal posts, you may identify yourself as a CSUMB faculty or staff member, but please be clear that you are sharing your personal views, not representing CSUMB. This parallels media relations practices at CSUMB.
</p><p>A common practice among individuals who write about the industry in which they work is to include a disclaimer on their site, usually on their “About Me” page. If you discuss higher education on your own social media site, we suggest you include a sentence similar to this: “The views expressed on this &#91;blog, Web site&#93; are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of CSUMB.”
</p><p><strong>Don’t be a mole.</strong> Never pretend to be someone else and post about CSUMB. Tracking tools enable supposedly anonymous posts to be traced back to their authors. There have been several high&#45;profile and embarrassing cases of company executives anonymously posting about their own organizations.
</p><p><strong>Take the high ground.</strong> If you identify your affiliation with CSUMB in your comments, readers will associate you with the university, even with the disclaimer that your views are your own. Remember that you’re most likely to build a high&#45;quality following if you discuss ideas and situations civilly.
</p><p><strong>Be aware of liability.</strong> You are legally liable for what you post on your own site and on the sites of others. Follow the same CSUMB honor code, FERPA, Conflict of Interest Policy, Privacy and general civil behavior guidelines cited above including respecting copyrights and disclosures, and not revealing proprietary financial, intellectual property or similar sensitive or private content. Individual bloggers have been held liable for commentary deemed to be proprietary, copyrighted, defamatory, libelous or obscene &#40;as defined by the courts&#41;.
</p><p><strong>Remember that all content contributed on all platforms becomes immediately searchable and can be immediately shared.</strong> This content leaves the contributing individual faculty/staff/students members’ control forever. Employers are increasingly conducting Web searches on job candidates before extending offers. Be sure that what you post today will not come back to haunt you.
</p><p><strong>Follow a code of ethics.</strong> There are numerous codes of ethics for bloggers and other active participants in social media, all of which will help you participate responsibly in online communities. If you have your own social media site, you may wish to post your own code of ethics or adapt an existing code already on the Web. Monitor comments. Most people who maintain social media sites welcome comments; it builds credibility and community. However, you can set your site so that you can review and approve comments before they appear. This allows you to respond to comments in a timely way. It also allows you to delete spam comments and to block any individuals who repeatedly post offensive or frivolous comments.
</p><p><strong>Share and link back.</strong> Please share content posted on official CSUMB social media channels across your personal networks, and link back from your site to CSUMB.EDU. By virtue of self identifying as part of CSUMB in such a network, faculty/staff/students connect themselves to, and reflect upon, the university.

</p><p>Tony Boles has joined California State University, Monterey Bay as associate vice president of Campus Development and Operations.
</p><p>He will oversee campus master planning and building space management, all campus design and construction services, environmental protection and facilities maintenance.
</p><p>" I see coming to the CSU MB as a great opportunity to be part of the growth and development of a new and exciting campus in one of the most beautiful places in the world," Mr. Boles said.
</p><p>He brings 25 years experience in all phases of architectural design work, planning and construction project development for a wide range of private- and public-sector facilities. He comes from Gafcon Construction and Project Management, where he managed the development of a $1.1 billion, 1,700-acre park project in Irvine.
</p><p>Earlier, he was senior deputy director/county architect for the County of San Diego, where he managed the capital improvement and master planning programs. He also served as associate director and construction administrator at San Diego State University, where he oversaw more than $50 million in campus improvement projects.
</p><p>Mr. Boles served in the U. S. Navy's Civil Engineer Corps, where he directed major construction projects throughout the world. He completed his Navy career as the base closure manager for the Marine Corps air stations in El Toro and Tustin.
</p><p>He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture from Cal Poly Pomona and also earned a master's degree in city and regional planning from San Diego State University. He is a registered architect in California.
</p><p>Mr. Boles joined the university on Oct. 18. He replaces Niraj Dangoria, who left CSUMB earlier this year to become assistant dean, facilities planning and management, at Stanford University.
</p><p>Location, location, location.
</p><p>The real estate agents’ mantra may also explain the next undergraduate major to be added to the curriculum at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>It is location that attracted Elyssa Farmer, a freshman from Pacifica.
</p><p>“As a 10-year-old, I fell in love with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and wanted to become a marine biologist just like the ones at the aquarium,” she said. When it came time to choose a college, she decided on CSUMB because “it’s located next to one of the richest marine regions in the world. Because of that, I figured it would be sensible to study it here.”
</p><p>As faculty member Bill Head, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy, points out, “When you think of Monterey Bay, you think of marine science.
</p><p>“We have a more concentrated number of marine science institutions here than anywhere in the country.”
</p><p>Marine science has been part of the curriculum almost since the beginning of the university, offered as a concentration called “marine and coastal ecology” within the Environmental Science, Technology and Policy degree program. Courses have been added over the years, including a scientific diving program that was introduced last spring. It filled up in a day-and-a-half.
</p><h5>A new degree is born</h5><p>As soon as the approval process is completed, that concentration – which has by far the largest enrollment of the five available in the ESTP major – will be renamed “marine science” and elevated to a separate program, leading to a bachelor of science degree.
</p><p>Elevating the popular program to degree status meets student demand for a degree with a more recognizable name and serves to make the program more visible and attractive to prospective students.
</p><p>“Our job is to present students with a suite of opportunities,” said Dr. James Lindholm, the Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine Science and Policy. “It’s the Field of Dreams approach – create it and they will come.”
</p><p>And it meets the needs of employers.
</p><p>“Employer surveys show a demand for graduates who can address real-world, interdisciplinary problems and have good technical skills,” said Dr. Marsha Moroh, dean of the College of Science.
</p><p>An important part of the program is the hands-on experience students get with advanced technologies for collecting, analyzing and communicating scientific data.
</p><h5>Hands-on experience</h5><p>Students get that hands-on experience in the laboratory and through fieldwork, often working alongside professors on real-world research projects. Teaching and mentoring are at the heart of the experience.
</p><p>“We give students training in geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and seafloor mapping,” Dr. Lindholm said.
</p><p>A prolific researcher, he involves students – undergraduates as well as graduate students in the Coastal and Watershed Science and Policy program – in much of his work.
</p><p>Since joining the faculty at CSUMB in 2007, Dr. Lindholm has established the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology. The goal of the institute is to understand the interaction of marine ecological systems and human activities.
</p><p>Among the institute’s many projects is one surveying deep-water habitats in the newly created marine protected areas along California’s north central coast ­– from San Mateo County north to Mendocino County, using a remotely operated vehicle. The information gathered will serve as the foundation of a program to evaluate the status of fish, invertebrates and their seafloor habitats inside and outside the new MPAs.
</p><p>Another project involves collecting video and photos that help to explore, describe and catalogue the resources of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
</p><p>He’s also researching the recovery of seafloor habitats off Morro Bay and the Gulf of Maine following the cessation of trawling.
</p><h5>Ten days in an undersea laboratory</h5><p>Perhaps the project with the highest visibility is Dr. Lindholm’s work with Aquarius, the world’s only underwater laboratory.
</p><p>In 2008, he led a mission that studied the movement and behavior of coral reef fish off Key Largo in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Dr. Lindholm supported the mission from the surface, but three CSUMB graduate students spent 10 days in the lab, 60 feet below the sea surface.
</p><p>He returned in October to lead Aquarius 2010: If Reefs Could Talk, a mission designed to educate the public so they can make informed decisions about how their actions impact the world’s most important resource – the ocean.
</p><p>Dr. Lindholm and a graduate student lived in the laboratory, which he says is similar to the International Space Station in size and functionality. Two students worked from the surface, and two more were “ambassadors” for the program, working with Monterey County schools that showed live broadcasts from the lab.
</p><p>Qualifying for the mission isn't easy. The physical requirements are similar to what potential astronauts face. All participants have to be experienced divers with research and rescue certifications.
</p><p>"This is truly a remarkable opportunity for these students," Dr. Lindholm said. "What they are going to experience is extraordinary."
</p><h5>Students work on seafloor mapping</h5><p>Other opportunities – and jobs – are available to students through the university’s Seafloor Mapping Lab.
</p><p>Supported through grant and contract work, the Seafloor Mapping Lab conducts marine habitat survey work from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The lab has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California's state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles.
</p><p>The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>“We know more about the surface of Mars than the three-mile strip of state waters along our coast,” Dr. Kvitek said. “If the goal is to protect and sustainably manage our marine resources, we don’t have the tools to do it without that basic map. You can see everything down to the size of a lawn chair, and you can look for changes year after year.”
</p><p>Dr. Kvitek’s work has been featured on the Discovery Channel and in National Geographic magazine, among other publications.
</p><p>These opportunities to do hands-on research appeal to students.
</p><p>“I chose CSUMB because the fieldwork with the marine program is a big part of it, and I like working outside, with people,” said Jazmyn Julius, a freshman from Santa Maria.
</p><p>Katie Wrubel can tell Jazmyn about that.
</p><p>Wrubel, a 2010 graduate of the ESTP program, spent the summer working with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The 10-week program was identified by CSUMB’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center and sponsored by Oregon State University.
</p><p>She’s now pursuing a Ph.D. in environmental science at Washington State University in Vancouver.
</p><p>“The people I met are the best part,” Wrubel told OSU. “The marine science world is so small and it seems that everyone knows everyone, so joining that circle has opened so many doors for me.”
</p><p>AT A GLANCE
</p><p>Currently, more than half of the 300 Environmental Science, Technology and Policy majors at Cal State Monterey  Bay and about 30 percent of the 400 biology majors are pursuing marine-related concentrations.
</p><p>No other school in the 23-campus California State University system offers a B.S. in marine science. Pending approval, the degree is scheduled to be offered at CSUMB in the fall of 2012.
</p><p>Marine scientists deal with a variety of issues ­– from climate change, declining fisheries and eroding coastlines to the invention of new technologies to explore the sea.
</p><p>According to NOAA, there’s a huge potential for growth in the field as researchers learn more about the ocean and its interactions with the land and atmosphere, how humans affect the ocean, and the impact of ocean resources on our quality of life.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison urged faculty and staff of Cal State Monterey Bay to answer a call to service and excellence for the university and its students in her annual State of the University address in August.
</p><p>“… In spite of the still-sluggish economy and the unresolved state budget, I have never been so proud of our entire university or felt more confident of its continued progress,” she said.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison pointed out the positive response the university has received from the organization reviewing its application for re-accreditation. “California State University, Monterey Bay has turned an important corner from its formative years and is maturing as a comprehensive university for the 21st century,” she said.
</p><p>More than 1,100 new students – freshmen and transfers – attended campus orientation sessions during the summer. But Dr. Harrison reminded her audience that more than 3,200 qualified applicants had to be turned away because of a budget-imposed cap on enrollment.
</p><p>The new students, she pointed out, “come with high expectations, and they are counting on us to help them achieve their goals – regardless of the state budget.”
</p><p>Money will continue to be tight for years to come, she said. “A scarcity of public dollars has become the new normal.”
</p><p>But Dr. Harrison quickly moved beyond money to talk about a few of the university's recent accomplishments.
</p><p>The biology, psychology, kinesiology, business, math and computer science majors have clearly resonated with students. And so does the new Master of Social Work program, which started its first class with approximately 40 students.
</p><p>“We will not be stymied by state budgets or be satisfied to simply ride out the storm,” Dr. Harrison said. “Together we will continue to innovate and be leaders in our disciplines and services and in higher education.”
</p><p>The number of CSUMB students from the tri-county area increased in Fall 2010. Residents of Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties now make up 33 percent of enrollment, compared with 31 percent last year. Northern California and Southern California each supply approximately another third of students.
</p><p>Total enrollment is 4,790 this semester, including 829 freshmen and 490 new transfer students. This year’s incoming class has a grade-point average of 3.25, up slightly from last year.  
</p><p>Marina Mayor Bruce Delgado presented a ceremonial key to the city to President Dianne Harrison as part of Otter Fest 2010, the city’s welcome-back event for students held Aug. 29, the first Sunday of the fall semester.
</p><p>Prior to the event, Delgado told the City Council, Marina “wants them, loves them and needs them,” referring to students and the potential boon they represent to the city. Otter Fest included extended hours at the weekly farmers market, food, cooking and gardening demonstrations, live music from a trio of bands, and a business promotion with “Otter Fest passports” and prizes designed to get students into many of the city’s businesses.  
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay is one of the most racially diverse schools in its category, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report in the 2011 edition of America’s Best Colleges.
</p><p>CSUMB is tied with Amherst College at No. 11 on the magazine’s “diversity index” among national liberal arts colleges – schools that award at least half their degrees in the fields of liberal arts. Approximately 265 colleges and universities are in the category. The “diversity index” factors in the total proportion of minority students and the overall mix of groups. The information is drawn from each school’s 2009-10 student body.
</p><p>CSUMB also was a leader in the U.S. News category of least debt owed by students. Members of the class of 2009 who borrowed money had an average debt of $15,254.
</p><p>Washington Monthly magazine rated CSUMB highly, as well.
</p><p>The university ranked second among the nation’s public liberal arts colleges in its contribution to the public good, according to the magazine’s 2010 College Guide.
</p><p>The Washington Monthly rates schools based on: recruitment and graduation of low-income students; cutting-edge scholarship and Ph.D.s; and students who give back to their communities.  
</p><p>For the third straight year, CSUMB has received a grant from the outdoor recreation retailer REI for the university’s Return of the Natives project.
</p><p>The $15,000 grant will support work with school children and local teachers, university students and community volunteers on habitat-restoration projects on Fort Ord public lands, the creeks of Salinas and Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District lands in Locke-Paddon Park and Marina Dunes Preserve.
</p><p>Return of the Natives is dedicated to bringing people closer to nature and nature closer to people through hands-on experience in restoring habitats. The REI grant is one of many received by CSUMB, totaling $18.2 million in 2009-10.  
</p><p>In an effort to maximize the education students receive outside the classroom, CSUMB now offers residents the opportunity to live in “themed” learning communities.
</p><p>Students can choose to live on residence hall floors set aside for those interested in science and math, outdoor adventure, liberal studies or business. While no academic content is tied to the living arrangement, leisure-time activities are scheduled around the topics.
</p><p>Freshmen also have the option of participating in Project Higher Ground, where they live in residence halls with a group of students who take at least two courses together.  
</p><p>Filmmaker Magazine has honored CSUMB alumni Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck.
</p><p>The magazine, a quarterly publication and website devoted to independent film, named the pair to its annual list of “25 New Faces.”
</p><p>The list is the magazine's “bet on the individuals who will be shaping the independent film world of the future.”
</p><p>When Machoian (Class of '07) and Ojeda-Beck ('09) met as students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, they had different styles but found a third when working together.
</p><p>The films they have made together display classic art house film style, according to the magazine. Visuals are the key, along with colorful imagery and solitary characters in simple situations, with editing that tells a story without much dialogue.
</p><p>At CSUMB, their goal was to make as many films as they could over the course of a semester, resulting in 14 shorts. “Ella and the Astronaut” was shown at festivals all over the world, and “Charlie and the Rabbit” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last January.
</p><p>Machoian has become the first TAT alumnus to get a university teaching job. He has a full-time position this semester at Cal State Sacramento, replacing a faculty member who is on leave. Ojeda-Beck is enrolled in the Master of Fine Arts program at UC Berkeley with a fellowship to help cover the cost.
</p><p>Dance is at center stage for the World Theater’s 10th anniversary season.
</p><p>The Paul Taylor Dance Company returns Nov. 11. Taylor has choreographed a new dance called “Brief Encounters,” in celebration of his 80th birthday. The piece is set to the music of Claude Debussy’s “Children’s Corner.”
</p><p>On Oct. 21, Madrid-based Noche Flamenca made its first visit to campus, presenting the Spanish folk art form of rapid, fluid guitar playing, heart-piercing vocals and impassioned dancing.
</p><p>The fall schedule will close Dec. 11 with a Hawaiian family holiday performance featuring slack key guitarist George Kahumoku. Known as Hawaii’s Renaissance man, Kahumoku is an accomplished musician as well as a sculptor, painter, teacher, farmer and captivating storyteller.
</p><p>All performances start at 7:30 p.m. For ticket information, visit the theater online at <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu/">CSUMB.EDU/worldtheater</a> or call 831-582-4580.

</p><p>After a career in the Army, and a second one spent in the mining industry in Peru, Dick Guthrie of Pebble Beach was looking for ways to satisfy his curiosity about, well, almost everything.
</p><p>He heard about the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute from someone he knew and discovered that for a $149 annual fee, he could participate in a variety of programs for a single price.
</p><p>Guthrie signed up, and is now in his second year.
</p><p>“I have a wide range of interests, and OLLI satisfies them,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for everyone in the area.” This year, he’s taking writing classes and one in archaeology.
</p><p><strong>TO GET INVOLVED:</strong> An annual OLLI membership fee of $149 covers up to six classes. Become a member by going online at <a href="http://csumb.edu/olli">CSUMB.EDU/olli</a>. The site has course and enrollment information. Membership includes a university parking pass and discounts to the World Theater and athletic events, as well as use of athletic facilities. Students may also choose to pay a per&#45;class fee. To register by mail, call the OLLI office at 831&#45;582&#45;5500
</p><p>Guthrie is one of several hundred people participating in OLLI, which was established at Cal State Monterey Bay four years ago with funding from the Bernard Osher Foundation of San Francisco. The 80&#45;year&#45;old Osher is a champion of lifelong learning who backs up that passion with donations of hundreds of millions of dollars. His generosity has funded 119 OLLI programs around the country.
</p><p>The program is intended for people over 50. Classes focus on personal enrichment and come in a variety of formats: Some are lectures, others are discussions; still others are hands&#45;on. The courses require no tests, research papers or grades.
</p><p>Most classes are held on campus, though a few are held at other community locations. Topics this semester include gospel choir; modern spiritual masters and integral philosophy, both taught by John Provost; weather and hurricanes; a cultural history of jazz; autumn bird migration; and the California elections, taught by former State Assemblyman Fred Keeley.
</p><p>Guthrie and nine others turned out on a Thursday morning in September to resume the OLLI Writers’ Circle. All of them are continuing students. They range from beginning writers to published professionals. They’re working on all kinds of projects and all receive constructive feedback on their work. Guthrie is writing a memoir about his experience as a company commander in Vietnam. And he’s serious about it.
</p><p>“I won’t rest until I’ve told about the soldiers’ bravery and sacrifice under trying conditions,” he said. “The OLLI writing courses have helped me stay focused and productive.”
</p><p>If he can’t secure a traditional publisher, he intends to self&#45;publish the book.
</p><p>Kathy Whilden of Monterey, a retired social worker, has been in the Writers Circle since it formed.
</p><p>“I always thought of myself as a writer – I loved that part of my job. I’m reporting on my life now; I reported on other people’s lives then,” she said.
</p><p>“Writing about my life is a way to give it validation.”
</p><p>Andrea Gilliland, a psychology major and certified pastry chef, works for Sodexo in the Catering Department and the Otter Bay Cafe.
</p><p>During last year’s Otter Orientation, she inquired about a gluten-free meal for her mother. This inquiry, along with her culinary experience, landed her a chef position for Sodexo while she continues as a full-time student. Gilliland has since introduced gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian and vegan options for diners.
</p><p>“Working in the Catering Department has provided me with challenges and also the ability to branch out in my creativity,” said the senior from San Luis Obispo. She also created menu items for the Have a Heart for Students Dinner and Auction, the Business Showcase Dinner, and this year’s post-Commencement luncheon.
</p><p>After graduation in spring 2011, she plans to cook her way through school as she completes a Master of Social Work degree.
</p><p>Austin Long, a senior in the Visual and Public Art Department, already has the sensitivity and worldliness of a great photographer. The son of an artist and a military officer, he spent half of his high school career in Bolivia, where he soaked up the culture and dabbled in photography.
</p><p>But what was once a hobby is now his career focus. Last year, Long received recognition for his talents as a photographer, winning the first Roy De Carva/Carrie Mae Weems Photo Prize, a $1,000 scholarship awarded by CSUMB’s VPA program to outstanding student photographers.
</p><p>“I’m more at home in the VPA program,” he said. “The program’s strength is teaching us how to think like artists, how to conceptualize our work, not just produce it.”
</p><p>Long needed a compelling portfolio to receive the award, and he had one.
</p><p>Two summers ago, while on a trip with his grandfather to the Dominican Republic, he documented daily life.
</p><p>Cupping a 1987 Model Nikon N4004 camera in his hand and shooting with Velvia slide film, Long traversed the cities of Jaibon and Santo Domingo. The simple moments of children playing jump rope, elderly men relaxing in the afternoon, and teenagers chatting under a tree caught his eye.
</p><p>Long plans to be a commercial photographer when he graduates this spring while continuing to pursue his art.
</p><p>“Everyone here actually has an art career, on top of teaching,” he said. “It is cool to be able to talk to people who are working artists.”  
</p><p>For the first time since its inception in 1985, CSU Summer Arts will reside at CSU Monterey Bay, bringing an artistic explosion to Monterey County. On July 2, the first of Summer Arts' five-year residency at CSUMB began. – <em>California State University website,</em> July 2, 2012
</p><h3>CSUMB librarian part of group performing in London</h3><p>Cal State Monterey Bay didn’t land an athlete at the Olympics, but the university will be represented in another way.
</p><p>Reference and instruction librarian Sarah Dahlen is a member of the Monterey Peninsula Choral Society. The 113-member group will perform at several venues in London during the Games, one of just six choirs in the world invited to sing during the 17-day run of the Olympics.
</p><p>“The choir typically has rehearsals once a week, but for the weeks leading up to our departure, we’ve had four each week,” Dahlen said. “And I’ve done a lot of work on my own as well, and am usually singing in the car.”
</p><p>The choir is scheduled to perform at Olympic Park, where as many as 30,000 people are expected to be in the audience. The singers will also perform at Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and several other venues.
</p><p>“Our repertoire includes about 25 songs and I’ve pretty much got all of them memorized at this point,” she said.
</p><p>The society will present a bon voyage concert July 27 at a church in Carmel; Dahlen will leave for Paris the next morning.
</p><p>“We’re skipping the craziness of the Opening Ceremonies to sing at a couple of venues in Paris: La Madeleine Church and EuroDisney,” Dahlen said.
</p><p>The group, which also includes retired CSUMB staff member Diane Ehlers, will take a ferry to the United Kingdom on Aug. 1, in time to do some sightseeing before their concerts.
</p><p>“I’ve never been to the Olympics before, but I think it’s an amazing event and it will be great to be around the energy of the athletes and spectators in the park, even if we’re not able to attend a competition” Dahlen said.
</p><p>The organizers were not able to secure tickets for the large group, but “they made up for it by getting us tickets to see Wicked in London’s West End.”
</p><p>Most members of the group will return home on Aug. 6, but Dahlen will head to Finland for a couple of weeks. She’ll attend a meeting of the International Federation of Library Associations, where she’s scheduled to present a workshop on using rubrics for information literacy instruction. And then she’s headed to Kuusamo, 37 miles south of the Arctic Circle, for a week of vacation.
</p><p>“I’m hoping to do some hiking there and enjoy the long daylight hours,” she said.

</p><h3>An insider’s look at Seattle’s outsider poet</h3><p>The Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department at CSU Monterey Bay will present a screening of “I Am Secretly an Important Man” at the Osio Theater in Monterey on March 5.
</p><p>The documentary film, directed by Peter Sillen, will be shown at 7 p.m.
</p><p>In the film, Sillen examines the life of subculture hero Steven Jesse Bernstein. Bernstein, a songwriter, poet and performance artist, was a literary rebel and vivid presence in Seattle’s underground scene in the 1970s and ’80s. Cited as the “godfather of grunge,” he opened concerts for Nirvana and Soundgarden and recorded albums of songs and poetry for Sub Pop Records.
</p><p>The film’s title comes from one of his poems, “Come Out Tonight.” It became an inspiration and an anthem for the grunge-rock movement.
</p><p>Using video and audio clips of his subject, along with interviews with the artist’s family, friends and colleagues, and powerful footage of the darker side of Seattle, Sillen shows the poet’s self-examination and what Bernstein called just plain “doing your job.”
</p><p>The director will be on hand to introduce the film and to take questions from the audience after the showing. A New York based documentary filmmaker, Sillen is best known for his low-tech approach and sensitivity to his subjects and their environment. He has screened his films at a wide array of festivals and venues including the Sundance Film Festival, Berlin Film Festival, South By Southwest, Slamdance, the Museum of Modern Art, Brooklyn Academy of Music and San Francisco’s Castro Theater.
</p><p>Mike Plante, an associate programmer of the Sundance Film Festival who has worked with TAT for several years, selected the film.
</p><p>According to TAT department chair Enid Blader, “Mike selected it not only because it fits with the literary tradition of the Monterey Bay area, but also to continue championing films that might otherwise go unseen, and to support a filmmaker who is telling a story in a distinct and stylish way.”
</p><p>Tickets can be purchased at the door at the regular Osio prices: $9 for general admission, $6.25 for seniors, $6.75 for students/military with ID.

</p><h3>Campus will participate in systemwide workshop</h3><p>Whether at a field site or in a lab, the chance to conduct research is a game&#45;changer for many CSU Monterey Bay students when it comes to earning a degree.
</p><p>The experiences, they say, can ignite a passion, build and reinforce confidence, keep them on track for graduation and provide a head start on graduate school.
</p><p>At CSUMB, the challenge of pursuing a hypothesis down a rigorous line of research is infused throughout the curriculum. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center – UROC – builds on the curriculum to engage students in research beyond the classroom.
</p><p>UROC is a cross&#45;campus center that serves students in multiple disciplines. These experiences help students make the link between their classroom and the wider world and help them to develop critical skills for success in graduate school and professional life.
</p><p>Now, campuses in the CSU are coming together to do some serious thinking about undergraduate research across the 23&#45;campus system. Because of its leadership in this area, CSUMB has been selected to participate in a workshop next October designed to improve and expand the opportunities for students. Eight other campuses will also participate. The emphasis will be on the STEM – science, technology, engineering and math – fields.
</p><p>The workshop will emphasize connecting current undergraduate research activities across campuses, developing databases to track students’ progress, building undergraduate research into faculty workload and identifying a curriculum model that would provide every undergraduate access to research opportunities.
</p><p>UROC began in January 2009. Since then, nearly 200 students have been served; currently, 60 students are engaged in or pursuing research placements.
</p><p>“We know the power of undergraduate research here at CSUMB,” said Dr. Bill Head, UROC director and professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy. “We’re proud of the commitment and leadership our campus has shown at providing these opportunities for our students.
</p><p>“We look forward to collaborating with our partner campuses to expand these opportunities throughout the CSU educational experience.”

</p><h3>UCLA’s Cheryl Keyes visits CSUMB </h3><p>Dr. Cheryl Keyes, professor of ethnomusicology in the School of Music at UCLA, will lecture on the development of rap/hip-hop music when she visits CSU Monterey Bay on Dec. 6.
</p><p>The free lecture will be held from 10 to 11:50 a.m. in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue and Butler Street.
</p><p>Dr. Keyes is the author of “Rap Music and Street Consciousness,” which received a CHOICE award for outstanding academic books when it was published in 2004.
</p><p>This professor speaks the language of the streets; she also speaks on panels and at seminars as a nationally recognized rap/hip-hop scholar whose academic credentials include a Ph.D. from Indiana University.
</p><p>While “rap” defines the music, Dr. Keyes told the Long Beach Press-Telegram, hip-hop embodies a larger “youth art movement,” composed of music, graffiti, attitude and dress. Her work draws on research she has done in West Africa, New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles and London.
</p><p>Rap music, according to Dr. Keyes, is a forum that addresses the political and economic disenfranchisement of black youths and other groups, fosters ethnic pride, and displays cultural values and aesthetics. Blending popular culture with folklore and ethnomusicology, she offers a nuanced portrait of the artists, themes, and various styles reflective of urban life and street consciousness. A filmmaker, she has completed a documentary called “Beyond Central Avenue: Contemporary Female Jazz Instrumentalists of Los Angeles,” funded by UCLA’s Center for Community Partnerships. Her musical creative works have been performed by the Women’s Jazz Orchestra of Los Angeles. As a performer, she played with trumpeter Clark Terry’s All-Girl All-Star Jazz Band, and she has recorded with New Orleans rhythm-blues pianist Eddie Bo, and with jazz clarinetist Alvin Batiste. Her debut CD, Let Me Take You There, won an Image Award from the NAACP in the category of Outstanding World Music Album.” Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>. While the lecture is free, visitors must buy a parking permit from machines located on the adjacent lot.

</p><p>Imagine if, over a decade, San Francisco Bay lost enough sediment to fill about 5,000 Olympic swimming pools with sand and gravel, and some mud.
</p><p>That's appears to be what happened.
</p><p>According to research just published by CSU Monterey Bay professor Rikk Kvitek (pictured at right) and U.S. Geological Survey researcher Patrick L. Barnard, an analysis of bathymetric (or sea-bottom) measurements taken in 1997 and again in 2008 indicates that the west-central San Francisco Bay – roughly from the Golden Gate to about a mile east of Angel Island and Alcatraz – lost about 14.1 million cubic meters of sediment. That's the equivalent of about a square mile piled about 17 feet high – or those 5,000 pools.
</p><p>The report appears in the current issue of San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science. Access it here.
</p><p>The 2008 analysis, they wrote, benefited from advances in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that virtually eliminated inaccuracies due to changing tides or rocking vessels; and from recent improvements in multi-beam sonar, seafloor sampling and underwater video that more clearly reveal the depth and nature of sediments above bedrock.
</p><p>"The seafloor position can now be mapped with unprecedented detail and precision," the researchers wrote.
</p><p>Their mapping covered about 15.6 square miles, about one-fourth of which was under lease for aggregate mining. The leased areas, they found, lost sediment at more than four times the rate of the non-leased areas. (Overall, based on soundings taken from 1947 to 1979, San Francisco Bay appears to be losing sediment three times faster than it did in the mid- to late-20th century.)
</p><p>Kvitek and Barnard conclude that the recently lost, predominantly coarse, sediment was "material that would otherwise have been available for transport to eroding, open-coast beaches" along the San Francisco shoreline.

</p><h3>CSUMB Rotaract Club organizes March 29 event</h3><p>The CSU Monterey Bay Rotaract Club will host a Zumbathon to benefit the American Cancer Society’s Relay for Life from 10 a.m. to noon, Saturday, March 29 at Water City Skate in Marina.
</p><p>Relay for Life is more than just a fundraiser. It’s a time to “celebrate, remember and fight back” against cancer. CSUMB Rotaract, a campus organization dedicated to community service and affiliated with Rotary International, is doing just that with this upbeat, high-energy event.
</p><p>According to club co-president Charn Singh, a junior biology major, Rotaract brings together college students for the purpose of humanitarian service, networking, building goodwill and promoting peace around the world. Said Singh: “One thing that makes our club unique is that we’re not university-based; instead, we’re community-based. Students from Monterey Peninsula College, Hartnell College, Monterey Institute of International Studies and the Defense Language Institute can join, and we have several members from each of those institutions.”
</p><p>Zumbathon participants are asked to make a $10 minimum donation. All proceeds will go to the American Cancer Society. Raffles, prizes and giveaways from local restaurants and businesses will be part of the fun.
</p><p>Relay for Life is a life-changing event that gives everyone a chance to celebrate the lives of those who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost and fight back against the disease.
</p><p>“Everyone knows someone touched by cancer, which in itself is really scary. It’s important for our community to come together and help finish the fight against cancer,” Singh said.
</p><p>“Sometimes, it’s easy to feel small when you want to do something major. As long as we have passionate individuals who want to help in any way, then I know we can make a difference. It’s all about ‘Service Above Self’.”
</p><p>Participants should bring water, a towel and a smile to this event. To find out more about the Zumbathon, contact Carina at <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x63;&#97;&#x6e;&#x64;&#114;&#x61;d&#101;&#x40;&#99;&#115;&#x75;&#109;&#x62;&#x2e;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">candrade@csumb.edu</a>.

</p><p>. . . CSU Monterey Bay is ranked fourth among the nation's public liberal arts colleges in its contribution to the public good. The university is also ranked third overall in research expenditures, according to the Washington Monthly 2011 College Guide published this week. – <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Sept. 3, 2011
</p><p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has once again honored CSU Monterey Bay for its focus on service and public engagement, making it one of only 361 institutions in the United States to hold the classification.
</p><p>The 2015 Community Engagement Classification documents CSUMB’s “excellent alignment among campus mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices that support dynamic and noteworthy community engagement,” according to the foundation. Community engagement, as defined by the foundation, focuses on the collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources. “We appreciate this recognition by the Carnegie Foundation,” said CSUMB President Eduardo Ochoa.
</p><p>“Community engagement has been a cornerstone of CSUMB since our founding and its importance has only grown over the years. We want to continue to build on our tradition of service learning and to seek new and meaningful ways to build partnerships that help move our community forward,” the president said.
</p><p>In 1970, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed the first <a href="http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu">classification system</a> for American colleges and universities as a research tool to describe and represent the diversity of U.S. higher education. The Community Engagement category was first created in 2006, and the designation was awarded to CSUMB that year. It is one indication of the growing importance of community service and civic engagement as a priority for higher education.  <strong>About the university’s community engagement initiatives</strong> ?CSUMB's community engagement initiatives are diverse and originate from every academic program, emblematic of CSUMB's commitment to active learning and its concern for its role as a "steward of the region."
</p><p>CSUMB is one of the few universities in the nation – public or private – to have made <a href="http://service.csumb.edu">service learning</a> a graduation requirement for all students. Through service learning, all CSUMB academic departments and programs have been able to develop strong relationships throughout the community.
</p><p>Nearly half of CSUMB students enroll in service learning courses each year, contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non&#45;profit organizations and government agencies in the region. A few examples of the university’s outstanding accomplishments in service learning and community engagement include:
</p><p>• CSUMB's <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/programs/chinatown&#45;renewal&#45;project">Chinatown Renewal Project</a>, which involves over 100 students each year in the revitalization of Chinatown neighborhood in Salinas;
</p><p>• <a href="http://ron.csumb.edu">Return of the Natives</a> environmental restoration project, which works with over 60 students in various environmental efforts;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://seafloor.otterlabs.org">Seafloor Mapping Project</a>, which develops detailed maps for state agencies;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://archaeology.csumb.edu/Courses/MissionArchaeology/introduction.htm">Mission Conservation Program</a>, which involves dozens of students in conservation and interpretation projects at the region's historic missions;
</p><p>• The <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/aug/1/mastering&#45;math">Algebra Academy</a> and <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/jun/25/high&#45;school&#45;students&#45;imagine&#45;college">Imagine College</a>, which work directly with local youth in college preparation courses. The university was honored with another community engagement award in December – the 2014 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, awarded by the Corporation for National and Community Service. CSUMB is the only two&#45;time recipient of the prestigious President’s Award for Community Service in Higher Education.
</p><h3>‘Steinbeck: The Art of Fiction’ includes sculpture by VPA grad</h3><p>Work by alumnus Lew Aytes will be on display at the American Tin Cannery through March 31. The exhibit, “Steinbeck: The Art of Fiction,” features artistic interpretations of John Steinbeck’s work in sculpture, photography and painting.
</p><p>Aytes’ pieces are three&#45;dimensional faces that represent his visions of Steinbeck’s characters.
</p><p>Works by photographer Robert Nease and painter Warren Chang are included in the exhibit, along with the Robert Lewis exhibit of Cannery Row photographs from 1957&#45;58.
</p><p>The exhibit was created for the National Steinbeck Center by Aytes and Nease, and displayed there last year. The current exhibit has been expanded to include Chang’s paintings of fieldworkers and Lewis’ historic images of Cannery Row.
</p><p>Aytes earned a bachelor’s degree from Sacramento State, where he studied music performance and conducting, and an MBA in finance from California Southern University. A re&#45;entry student at CSUMB, he earned a degree in Visual and Public Art in 2012.
</p><p>On his <a href="http://www.lewaytes.com">website</a>, he says: “In one form or another, art has existed in my life as long as I have memory. My first conscious production of art was musical . . . Music also transported me into the medium of sculpture later in life.”
</p><p>The exhibit is on display on the second floor of the American Tin Cannery, 125 Ocean View Blvd., Pacific Grove. The building is located around the corner from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. &#42;Photos Top: John Steinbeck sculpture by Lew Aytes Above: Aytes hanging his work at last year's exhibit at the National Steinbeck Center&#42;

</p><p>For the fifth consecutive year, Cal State Monterey Bay has been named a "military-friendly school" by G.I. Jobs magazine. –* The Salinas Californian*, Sept. 16, 2013
</p><p>The community is invited to a screening of Godfrey Reggio’s prophetic 1982 film, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> at 4 p.m., Oct. 1, in the TAT studio. The director will make a presentation and then screen the film. <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> – “life out of balance” in the Hopi language – is a visual tone poem with no dialogue and no conventional plot, which the director describes as a reversal of the typical saying that “a picture is worth a thousand words,” and is instead “a thousand images to convey the power of one word.” The film presents a stunning montage of images from urban traffic to desert vistas to electronic circuits, accompanied by a score from Philip Glass to explore the threats posed to nature by modern civilization. One critic called it a “unique, contemplative film.”
</p><p>Said Walter Ryce in the Monterey County Weekly: "It is a wordless work that said much about the world then (1982), and the world we live in now."  The showing and talk kicks off the Philip Glass Center for the Arts, Science and the Environment's annual Days and Nights Festival at Big Sur's Henry Miller Library and Carmel's Sunset Center. <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2013/sep/25/faculty-filmmakers-featured-days-and-nights-festival"><em>Faculty filmmakers' work screened at Days and Nights Festival</em></a>
</p><p>A seven-year stint in the U.S. Coast Guard offered Bridget Hoover many exciting experiences. It was also a time when she saw the water quality of the ocean at its worst.
</p><p>After responding to many oil spills off the Eastern Seaboard and the Northwest, this 1999 CSUMB graduate knew she had the potential to do something more.
</p><p>“It became very disheartening, and I wanted a job that was more proactive and preventative in nature. So that is how I directed my education,” said Hoover, who received a B.S. in Earth Systems Science &amp; Policy.
</p><p>For her senior capstone project, Hoover measured the water quality of runoff flowing from the outfalls in Monterey. She attributes her current career to the ESSP’s strong scientific foundation.
</p><p>Today, she is director of water quality protection for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Within the program Hoover and her staff work with cities to implement storm water management, assist agricultural industry efforts to reduce runoff into the ocean, and educate the community about preserving the Earth’s most valuable resource – water.
</p><p>“We all contribute to the pollution entering the sanctuary,” she said, “and we are all part of the solution.”
</p><h4>Public invited to free workshop Dec. 6</h4><p>“Save the Carmel River – Conserve Water Today” is the topic of the last class of the year offered by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The free, hourlong class will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 6 in the OLLI annex, located on the corner of Inter-Garrison Road and Sixth Avenue on the CSUMB campus.
</p><p>The session will be led by CSUMB students Erin Frolli, Jessica Chapman, Kat Miller and Sarah Jeffries.

</p><h3>Monologues tell women's stories</h3><p>The Vagina Monologues returns to CSU Monterey Bay Feb. 12, 13 and 14.
</p><p>The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the "Vagina Monologues" tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world.
</p><p>CSUMB's production is student&#45;run, student&#45;directed and features student actors. The monologues address issues such as rape, birth, sex and relationships; some are serious, some are funny, all are enlightening and explore new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.
</p><p>The play's staging at CSUMB is part of this year's V&#45;Day campaign. V&#45;Day's mission: to celebrate women and girls and to stop the sexual violence being perpetrated against them all over the world. V&#45;Day has raised millions of dollars since it started 15 years ago and has been named one of Worth Magazine's "100 Best Charities." V&#45;Day has grown exponentially, from an underground feminist event to a mainstream media one. Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine's Day.
</p><p>The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about violence against women. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to local organizations working to do just that. This year's production will feature new monologues. Parents, please note the mature content and adult themes of the play.

</p><p>For more than a century, the Delta Sigma Theta sorority has been committed to public service, with a primary focus on the black community. Now, there is a chapter at CSU Monterey Bay, the first historically African American sorority established on campus. The Upsilon Xi chapter was chartered in April with seven members: Diamond Gaskins, Shiyla Goodie, Nancy Her, Brigette Johnson, Tyler Posey, Courtney Thomas and Tiffany Williams.
</p><p>The chapter plans service projects for the fall that focus on physical and mental health issues that include all students, specifically geared toward under-represented women.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the largest black Greek organization in the country. More than a thousand chapters have initiated 200,000 members. It was founded in 1913 at Howard University to promote academic excellence and provide assistance to those in need.
</p><p>Delta Sigma Theta is the eighth sorority to be chartered at CSUMB; six fraternities are also active. (A complete list can be found <a href="http://activities.csumb.edu/multicultural-greek-council-0">here</a>.)
</p><p>"We are grateful for CSUMB's enthusiastic support for a collegiate chapter. Upsilon Xi will extend Delta's legacy of scholarship, service and sisterhood to the campus community, while connecting members committed to public service," said Brenda Grayson Shinault, the chapter's primary adviser and a member of the sorority’s Monterey Peninsula alumnae chapter.

</p><h3>Kinship Center collaborates with CSUMB</h3><p>Cal State Monterey Bay faculty member Kathryn England-Aytes believes in the power of real-world experience. As a lecturer in psychology, she works to give her students a chance to learn first-hand from professionals. This semester, students in her clinical psychology course are getting that opportunity thanks to a collaboration with the Kinship Center, a nonprofit that provides mental health and counseling services to children and families touched by adoption, foster care, relative caregiving or legal guardianship. Professionals at the Kinship Center are providing students with a look at the field of child welfare and mental health. Using clinical theory, hands-on activities and lectures at the center’s Salinas campus, the course brings real-life applications to students considering careers in the mental health field. The Kinship Center, a member of the Seneca Family of Agencies, has been honored nationally for its life-changing outcomes for more than 2,500 children each year through therapeutic foster care, kinship (relative) care, mental health services for children and families, intensive support for families in crisis, prevention programs to keep children out of child welfare, adoption and education and training for parents and professionals. “We’re excited about this collaboration,” Professor England-Aytes said. “It’s already connecting students with the community in ways that make us proud." Kinship staff members will deliver six lectures during the course of the semester, covering topics including cultural issues, child trauma, behavioral psychotherapy, group and family therapy and working with children and adolescents. After two lectures, students are clearly enthusiastic. Student evaluations have included these comments:
</p><p>?• “This experience has helped me choose my area of future study.” • “Great information from first-hand accounts.” • “The lectures get me thinking about what I really want to do with my education.” Kinship co-founder Carol Biddle said she is “delighted” to partner with the university to give students a better understanding of the practical applications of their educational program. She noted that the center has hired a number of CSUMB psychology graduates over the years. The center has also provided placements for students in CSUMB’s master’s program in social work, including two former students of England-Aytes.
</p><p>"Being able to share our remarkable psychology students with the mental health care community before they are seeking career positions is helpful for them; Kinship Center makes it truly meaningful," Professor England-Aytes said. <a href="http://csumb.edu/psychology">Learn about the psychology program at CSUMB</a>. <a href="http://www.kinshipcenter.org">Learn about the Kinship Center</a>

</p><p><strong>CHECK OUT THE VIDEO FROM THE MISSION <a href="http://isc.gso.uri.edu/oceanslive">HERE</a></strong>
</p><p>On Oct. 12, Dr. James Lindholm and graduate student Jessica Watson embarked on a scientific mission inside the world's only undersea research station.
</p><p>The station, named the Aquarius Undersea Laboratory, is similar to the International Space Station. But while astronauts explore outer space, "aquanauts explore inner space," said Watson.
</p><p>The pair, along with four other researchers, will live underwater for 10 days, diving eight hours a day to study coral reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Two other CSUMB students, Chelsea Parrish-Kuhn and Alexandra Davis, are also in Florida, working from the surface to support the underwater team.
</p><p>The Aquarius is about the size of a mobile home. It's equipped with hot showers, an Internet connection and other communications equipment. (And it's loaded with freeze-dried "hiker foods, reconstituted with hot water," Dr. Lindholm said.)
</p><p>It's owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and operated by the University of North Carolina Wilmington. It sits 60 feet underwater, four miles from shore off Key Largo. Its mission: scientific research, coral reef and ocean observation, undersea technology development, training, and ocean education and outreach. Since 1994, it has hosted 90 missions.
</p><p>The current mission is entitled "Aquarius 2010: If Reefs Could Talk." It is designed to bring the science of ocean conservation and the underwater world to classrooms and communities nationwide. Live broadcasts each day will focus on biodiversity, climate change and technology for field science.
</p><p>Although the aquanauts will be taking the time to conduct live broadcasts, their main focus is still the science behind the mission. They are studying the behavioral interactions of fishes that live in a range of coral habitats across the reef area.
</p><p>Living in Aquarius, Dr. Lindholm said, allows scientists to conduct research over an extended period of time. It's called saturation diving, when the body is completely saturated with nitrogen.
</p><p>Surface diving allows scientists a limited amount of time to reach the bottom and collect data before the body begins to "bend" ­– experiencing pain, said Dr. Lindholm, director of the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology or IfAME at CSUMB. But with saturation diving, he said, they can spend hours each day swimming with the fish they are studying.
</p><p>"There's a lot more time to observe things, things that you may not see elsewhere," he said.
</p><p>All this information will help marine biologists everywhere have a much better understanding of coral reef communities and how diverse species interact to find prey and avoid predators.
</p><p>The reason for the educational component is simple: A more informed public will make better decisions about what they do in their everyday lives and how those actions impact the world's most important resource – the oceans.
</p><p>This is Dr. Lindholm's fifth saturation mission and Watson's first.
</p><p>"I'm so thankful to have this opportunity," she said a few days before leaving for Florida. "I'll get to see the fish I'm studying." For her master's thesis, Watson is exploring how the feeding and swimming behaviors of three kinds of fish influence their movements.

</p><h3>‘Harold Heath’ is back in the water</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s new research vessel, the Harold Heath, was launched on May 16 after three months of extensive work in dry dock.
</p><p>Santa Cruz attorney Paul Meltzer donated the 46-foot Hatteras sport fishing yacht to the university last December. The boat was renamed “Harold Heath” in honor of Mr. Meltzer’s great-grandfather, a marine scientist and Stanford University professor.
</p><p>With the refitting – which included mounting sonar devices and other equipment – the vessel is ready for use by CSUMB’s Seafloor Mapping Lab (SFML), where it will support marine research, training and education. It is also equipped to support remotely operated vehicles and habitat survey work done by the university’s Institute for Applied Marine Ecology.
</p><p>After the launch in Moss Landing Harbor, finishing touches were added in preparation for the SFML’s field season this summer.
</p><p>That work involves mapping the last remaining section of state waters, along the southern Big Sur coast. “Because of the remote nature of this part of the coast, the work will require that we spend four or five days at a time at sea,” said Rikk Kvitek, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the lab.
</p><p>“The Hatteras – which can accommodate a crew of five for extended stays at sea – is ideal for this work.”
</p><p>The SFML has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California’s state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles. The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>Once the seafloor mapping project is finished, the boat will be used as a base for launching smaller vessels, like jet skis, rigged with video equipment and other devices to conduct further research near coastlines and other hard-to-reach spots.

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay was a finalist for the Presidential Award as part of the 2012 President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, the highest federal recognition a college or university can receive for its commitment to community service.
</p><p>The Corporation for National and Community Service received applications from more than 640 colleges and universities. Five received the Presidential Award; 14 were named finalists.
</p><p>In 2006, the program’s inaugural year, CSU Monterey Bay was one of three recipients of the top award. It has been named to the Honor Roll each year since then. The university earned the top honor again last year, making it the only two-time recipient of the President’s Award.
</p><p>"Not only is service learning woven into our curriculum," President Dianne Harrison said, "it also is part of our university's ethos of engaging with and contributing to our surrounding communities."
</p><p>The university was honored in the category of general community service, which recognizes the quality of and commitment to community service initiatives, and emphasizes long-term partnerships and measurable outcomes as a result of the service.

</p><p>CSUMB is the only public university in California, and one of the few nationally, where service learning is a requirement for all students. Each year, nearly 50 percent of CSUMB’s students enroll in service learning courses contributing more than 65,000 hours of service to more than 250 schools, non-profit organizations and government agencies in the tri-county area. And service learning is an academic department, where issues of service, diversity, social justice and social responsibility are linked to the core curriculum.
</p><p>“It’s wonderful to see our program being recognized nationally and even internationally,” said Dr. Seth Pollack, director of CSUMB’s Service Learning Institute.
</p><p>“No other university in the country has made as significant a commitment to developing students’ capacity for service and social responsibility,” Dr. Pollack said.
</p><p>“We have a very special program, and it feels great to again be recognized as a national leader.”
</p><p>The awards ceremony was held March 12 in Los Angeles.
</p><p>According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, honorees are chosen based on a series of selection factors, including the scope and innovation of service projects, the extent to which service-learning is embedded in the curriculum, the school’s commitment to long-term campus-community partnerships, and measurable community outcomes as a result of the service. <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/">Learn more about the Service Learning Institute at CSUMB</a>.
</p><h3>Lysley Tenorio visits campus April 8 as part of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month</h3><p>Short-story writer Lysley Tenorio will read from his work April 8 at CSU Monterey Bay. The public is invited to this free event.
</p><p>Tenorio is the author of <em>Monstress</em>, which binds together eight tales of isolated misfits in San Francisco and the Philippines. They have been described as “tender” and “quirky,” written from the point of view of charlatans, B movie starlets, superhero obsessives and transgender cocktail waitresses.
</p><p>NPR said of the stories: “Filipino traditions meet Californian modernity again and again, each encounter revealing something unexpected about both cultures.”
</p><p>The roots of Tenorio's tales are buried in his family's decision to immigrate to California when he was 7 months old. He grew up in a home eager to assimilate.
</p><p>His stories have appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine and <em>The Best New American Voices</em> and Pushcart Prize anthologies. A Whiting Writer's Award winner and a former Stegner Fellow at Stanford University, he has received fellowships from the University of Wisconsin and the National Endowment for the Arts.
</p><p>Tenorio lives in San Francisco and is an associate professor at Saint Mary’s College of California.
</p><p>The event will be held at 7 p.m. in the University Center living room, located on Sixth Avenue and B Street. While the reading is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit from a machine on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>. 
</p><p>Tenorio’s appearance is part of CSUMB’s celebration of Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month and is part of a series of readings called Writers from the Edge. In March, poet Aimee Suzara read from her first full-length collection, <em>Souvenir</em>. The series started in February with a reading by novelist Keenan Norris.
</p><p>For more information, contact Professor Ernest Stromberg at 582-3114.
</p><p>The reading is sponsored by the Division of Humanities and Communication; the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; Student Activities and Leadership Development; Asian Pacific Islander Association; and the Office of Inclusive Excellence.
</p><p><em>Tenorio…has taken a uniquely Filipino-American perspective, polyglot and glittering with cinema dreams, and used it to make a bold collection of stories of the rejected, the helpless and the lost. Monstress is the debut of a singular talent.</em> ?– NPR

</p><p>Head baseball coach Walt White’s tenure at CSUMB is off to a good start with the early signing of nine recruits for fall 2011.
</p><p>“This is the best early-sign class I have had in my 16 years of coaching,” White said. “This is a deep, balanced, dynamic, and athletic class that will come in and have a huge impact on our program. Every one of these players has great baseball ability, but more importantly, they bring an attitude and personality to our program that will set the tone for this baseball team from here on out.”
</p><p>With the new recruits, White thinks his team will have the potential to emerge as a national power.
</p><p>“The recruiting process by our staff was all about building relationships, trust, and the belief in our program by these players. This is the first step of something very special. We will put this recruiting class up against any other one in the nation . . . at any level.”
</p><p>The recruits are:
</p><p>• Matt Blake, right-handed pitcher from West Ranch High School. Blake was part of two playoff teams in the very tough Foothill Athletic League. Through fall games, he sports a 1.81 ERA.
</p><p>• Chris Blanton, first baseman, outfielder, left-handed pitcher from Burlingame High School. Blanton’s team won the Central Coast Section Division II Championship in 2010. As a junior, he was named All-Peninsula Athletic League first team, All-San Mateo County first team and All-Northern California second team. Blanton was also named to the all-tournament team in the prestigious NorCal World Series. He holds Burlington school records for RBI in a game (6) and in a season (37).
</p><p>• Steven Farnworth, right-handed pitcher from West Ranch High School. In the Valley Invitational League, Farnworth compiled a 2.62 ERA with 32 strikeouts in 24 innings, and a 4.5 strikeout/walk ratio. • Devin Finn, outfielder from Amador Valley High School. Finn led his team to an East Bay Athletic League title and the first North Coast Section title in school history. During his junior year, Finn batted .330 with five doubles. • Nolan Flashman, right-handed pitcher from University High School. During his junior season at University, Flashman earned an All-League first team selection with a 4-2 record, 2.28 ERA and.197 opponent batting average. He was also dominant at the plate, hitting .426 with 30 RBI.
</p><p>• Garrett Gemgnani, catcher from Culver City High School. As a junior, he was the most valuable player in the Ocean Athletic League, batting .326 with 30 runs scored and 32 runs batted in while flashing supreme defensive skills. • Matt Urakami, infielder from Branham High School. An All-Blossom Valley Athletic League first team infielder in 2010, he hit .402 with a .622 slugging percentage and a .510 on-base percentage. He is widely considered one of the premier defensive players in Northern California. • Cody Van Aken, right-handed pitcher and catcher from Live Oak High School. Van Aken is a threat on the mound and behind the plate. The All-Blossom Valley Athletic League first-team selection batted .391 with a .596 slugging percentage and 18 runs batted in. As a pitcher he went 4-3, striking out 29 batters in 35 innings. • Jesse White, catcher from Salinas High School. White led the Cowboys to a 22-8 record in 2010 behind the plate with his stellar glove work and rocket arm. He was named to the All-Tri-County Athletic League second team.
</p><p>Coach White joined CSUMB in July after 15 seasons as an assistant at Sonoma State. In 2008, he was instrumental in leading the Seawolves to a third-place finish in the NCAA Division II World Series after winning the CCAA and NCAA West Regional championships.
</p><p>He was the starting shortstop at Sonoma State in 1993 and 1994, then spent five seasons in the Florida Marlins minor-league system and three years at Triple A Tucson in the Arizona Diamondbacks’ organization. In 2002, he returned to Sonoma State to earn his bachelor’s degree in kinesiology. In 2005, he received a master’s degree in education from the University of Phoenix.

</p><p>CSUMB had a notable fall sports season when it came to academics. Thirty-two student-athletes were selected for CCAA all-academic teams. – <em>The Salinas Californian</em>, Dec. 19, 2014
</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay’s World Theater will present a tribute to the greatest hits of the 1950s and ’60s when The Alley Cats perform on Oct. 20.
</p><p>Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>By bringing their own contemporary style to tunes from that era, The Alley Cats appeal to fans of all ages, breathing new life into everyone's favorite doo-wop classics.
</p><p>For the uninitiated, doo-wop is an ebullient, rhythm and blues-fueled harmony vocal style where one person sings lead and the others harmonize or mimic the sounds of instruments behind them. It rose to prominence in the 1950s. The first real boy bands, before N’Sync and the Backstreet Boys, were doo-wop groups like the Del Vikings and Dion and the Belmonts, and in the Motown era, The Temptations, Four Tops and Miracles.
</p><p>The four members of The Alley Cats are a perfect blend both vocally and personally. Every Alley Cat performance is accompanied by the sounds of laughter and voices joining in to sing the melodies we all know and love.
</p><p>The Cats' engaging wit and humor have won over audiences nationally as they relate directly to the crowd with jokes, stories and audience participation that appeals to young and old alike. Tight harmonies, universal humor, and unbelievable a cappella energy have made The Alley Cats America's premier doo-wop group.
</p><p>The group has performed with Jay Leno, the Beach Boys and at the White House.
</p><p>Tickets are $40 premium, $29 general. Discounts are available for students and seniors. Tickets can be purchased online at csumb.edu/worldtheater or by calling the box office at 582-4580.

</p><p>The CSU Monterey Bay’s fall athletic teams – cross country, soccer and volleyball – kicked off their 2011 seasons on Aug. 15 with each team’s first official practice.
</p><p>The Otter soccer programs are under new leadership, with Rob Cummings guiding the men's side and Erin Reinke leading the women's team. With a lot of new faces, both squads will strive to garner some attention in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) this season.
</p><p>“I'm not sure how much you actually learn from the very first practice, but it was great to finally get out on the field and start working,” Cummings said. “We have a lot of new faces and it will be fun to start putting the pieces together.”
</p><p>Reinke echoed that feeling.
</p><p>“It's great to finally get everybody on the field,” Reinke said. “This is an important time for us. The work and preparation we do over the next few weeks is where we will learn to compete at the level we expect.”
</p><p>Practicing on a freshly resurfaced floor in the Kelp Bed, the Otter volleyball student-athletes came out crushing balls. Their focus is on preparing for their first game, a newly scheduled home match-up against Notre Dame de Namur on Aug. 30.
</p><p>“Day 1 is down,” said volleyball head coach Jody Garry. “I was really impressed with our returning starting libero Dionna Lucas. You can tell she had another good summer.”
</p><p>The key to any team is defense and the defensive leader, Garry said.
</p><p>The men's and women's cross country teams will field the most talented runners in program history. The full squad of 25 can be found running the old Fort Ord trails.
</p><p>“It was almost overwhelming seeing so many new faces on the first day,” said cross-country head coach Greg Rhines. “It was very exciting to see so many talented runners training together.”

</p><p>Elementary and middle-school students from across Monterey County are jump-starting their college careers with a summer program at the local state university. As part of CSU Monterey Bay's Junior Otters program, now in its third year, 240 migrant education students are practicing their math and language arts skills on the college campus. – The Salinas Californian, July 23, 2011
</p><p>With a computer keystroke on July 29, President Dianne Harrison filed a report that earned CSU Monterey Bay a gold rating from the nation’s leading advocacy group for sustainability in higher education. The university is one of only 18 institutions to receive that distinction.
</p><p>CSUMB becomes the first campus in the California State University system and the second public university in California to qualify for the gold rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.
</p><p>The rating, awarded in the organization's STARS program, signifies that the university is doing an outstanding job of going “green” in areas ranging from curriculum and construction to conservation of resources. STARS – which stands for Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System – measures and encourages sustainability in education and research, operations, and planning, administration and engagement.
</p><p>The rating is the result of a thorough, yearlong self-evaluation process that involved faculty, staff and students. STARS is a widely used sustainability self-assessment tool that helps colleges evaluate and publicly report how they’re doing, where they can improve, what peers are doing and mark progress over time.
</p><p>Examples of CSUMB’s sustainable practices: • Education and research: All students are required to take service learning courses that address sustainability; 35 percent of tenure-track faculty members are conducting research relating to sustainability. • Waste reduction: 90 percent of construction and demolition debris is diverted from landfills. • Water conservation: drought-tolerant landscaping, waterless urinals • Energy efficiency: reduced energy consumption by more than 25 percent over five years • Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions: All members of the campus community have access to free public transportation throughout the region.
</p><p>“The idea of sustainability is embedded in the curriculum here at CSUMB,” said Kevin Saunders, vice president for administration and finance. “We’re educating the region on these issues.”
</p><p>And because it is embedded in the curriculum, “Our students – who are our future leaders – can move through their lives and careers with this ethic of sustainability,” President Harrison said. In the innovation category, the university earned the maximum four points for: • The annual Focus the Region event, a daylong teach-in on environmental issues  • The Chinatown Renewal Project, an effort to help revitalize a blighted though historically rich neighborhood in Salinas. Sustainability has been a consistent theme in these efforts, which include a community garden where organic food is grown; workshops on natural building techniques; a composting enterprise; a solar-energy-generating gazebo; and a vermiculture micro-enterprise. • Planning for and use of electric vehicles • The TRIPwise program, an effort to educate the campus community about alternate forms of transportation and make them accessible.
</p><p>With the evaluation complete, CSUMB will continue to seek further gains in such areas as energy management, alternative transportation and waste reduction.
</p><p>“This is a starting point,” President Harrison said. “We know there are many more things we can do."  
</p><p>John Avella has been elected to the Monterey County Hospitality Association’s board of directors. Dr. Avella, assistant professor of hospitality management and hotel/resort management in CSU Monterey Bay's School of Business, will join the board in January. He’ll serve on the association’s education committee. His background includes 40 years of human resource development and teaching experience in the hospitality industry and higher education. He has been vice president of human resources for Marriott Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the World, and president of Human Resource Concepts. His work focused on management and executive development, customer service and organizational strategic change. His clients included Marriott Corporation, University of Florida, and Hilton Hotels, to name a few. Dr. Avella has taught on the graduate and undergraduate level at Columbia University, Empire State College, Fairleigh Dickinson University and City University of New York. In 2001, he was director of human resources for the food service group at the Salt Lake City Olympics – an operation that served 125,000 meals per day. In 2011, he was a consultant on tourism issues in Anhui Province, China. He has a doctorate from Columbia University, with a concentration in Adult and Organizational Learning. Among his research interests is the application of emotional intelligence to customer service/loyalty, emotional labor and leadership. He has developed a process that teaches people to “connect” to the customer and staff to create loyalty.

</p><p>Each year, hundreds of CSU students study abroad. Some debate international politics in Germany, some savor gelato in Italy, some learn about architecture – and enjoy the beaches of South Africa. This year, Guadalupe Arias is one of 81 CSU Monterey Bay students studying in 26 countries. The senior humanities major from Sacramento is spending the year at the Universidad de Granada in southern Spain.
</p><p>Like Arias, the majority of CSUMB students who study abroad do so for a full academic year.
</p><p>“We encourage students to stay that long in order to learn the language and customs and feel like a local rather than a traveler," said Holly White, CSUMB's international program manager.
</p><p>As she begins her second semester, Arias said she has adapted quite well to the culture and customs of Spain.
</p><p>“I start my day with a warm <em>café con leche</em>, a Spanish <em>tostada</em> and fresh orange juice,” she wrote in a photo essay on the CSU website. “From 2 to 4 in the afternoon, the Spanish have their siestas. At the beginning, I felt guilty for having two hours to nap and relax, but I have adjusted to the Spanish way of living. “I use that free time to do homework or take walks around the city.” She reported that she’s enjoying her classes and likes Granada’s proximity to the Mediterranean.  “I left home with an open mind and ready to absorb other cultures. Half of Granada’s population is composed of students from all over Europe and the Americas. I have learned so much about other parts of the world since I’ve been here,” she said. “This is my new home.” View a photo essay of Arias’ time in Spain <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/ip/photo-essays/country/spain/2011/arias/">here</a>.

</p><h3>Annual event celebrates legacy of late labor leader </h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay will be closed on March 30 in honor of Cesar Chavez.  Chavez led the non-violent movement for farm workers’ rights, a movement that extended beyond the fields and into cities and towns across the nation, and helped found the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farm Workers (UFW). Even with campus closed, the university community is still in action. On that day, and during the following weeks, many faculty, staff and students dedicate their time to both service and learning. ??March 30 will mark the start of CSUMB’s second annual Cesar Chavez Challenge, a 36-day community service drive – it ends on Cinco de Mayo – coordinated by the Purposeful Service Opportunities program. PSO is a joint project of the AmeriCorps VIP program and the Service Learning Institute. The theme for this year’s challenge is “Creating a Culture of Service,” and involves a friendly competition among student clubs, Greek organizations, athletic teams and residence halls to document 3,600 hours of service.
</p><p>This year, extra points will be awarded for uploading photos to a Facebook page that show volunteers at work, and registering for an online volunteer account with the Volunteer Center of Monterey County. Also new this year: Points will be awarded for philanthropic efforts, such as fundraisers and food drives, and for civic engagement, such as voter registration and attendance at city council meetings.
</p><p>Registration, contest rules and point system can be found <a href="http://service.csumb.edu/cesar-chavez-challenge">here</a>. Volunteer opportunities on or around Cesar Chavez Day include: • The Comics for Kids fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monterey County, March 27-31
</p><p>• The PURSUIT Youth Expo at the University Center ballroom, April 13. Mandatory volunteer training, March 31 • The 30-Hour Famine, sponsored by the Otter Christian Fellowship, March 30 and 31 • <a href="http://ron.csumb.edu/">Return of the Natives</a> clean-up effort, March 31

</p><p><em>The end of all education should surely be service to others. – Cesar Chavez</em>  
</p><p>Oct. 12, 2010
</p><p>As part of the California Library Association's "Snapshot: One Day in the Life of California Libraries," CSU Monterey Bay joined others throughout the state – including 19 other CSU campuses – to gather statistics for a typical day.
</p><p>All information was collected for one day during the week of Oct. 4; CSUMB collected its data on Oct. 5.
</p><p>The information reflects the libraries' invaluable services and will be used to advocate for libraries in Sacramento in November. Insights gathered from "snapshot" data will also help the CSU libraries improve and enhance their collections and services, according to the CSU Chancellor's Office.
</p><p>On Oct. 5, nearly 3,700 people visited the Tanimura and Antle Family Memorial Library at CSUMB. Kathlene Hanson, the library's electronic resources coordinator who was in charge of gathering data, said that number needs to be put in context.
</p><p>It represents the total number of times people walked through the doors. "That includes everyone who used the building as a shortcut to get from the café side to the classroom side; and, it counts people who entered multiple times," she said. "Nevertheless, it's an impressive number."
</p><p>Perhaps more important is the number of times the library's website was accessed that day: 40,670. Nearly 400 people used the library's computers, and another 600 used their own computers in the building.
</p><p>Despite today's transition to digital media, the American Library Association reports that visits to college libraries are on the rise – partly due to the fact that academic libraries are adapting to meet students' changing needs.
</p><p>University libraries are unique. Not only do they foster research and innovation, they prepare students to enter the knowledge&#45;based workforce upon graduation.
</p><p>Support for academic success is the primary mission of the CSUMB library. It's student&#45;centered, with student&#45;friendly spaces for study, for group work, and for co&#45;curricular programs. It's an active social space &#40;with a café and outdoor patio&#41; that supports student learning.
</p><p>Like other modern libraries, the one at CSUMB is collaborative, technology&#45;infused and adaptive to change. It's a place to get access to information in many formats and from many sources. Mobile access as well as "Ask a Librarian," a program that allows students to get help via instant messaging, are extending services beyond the physical walls of the building.
</p><p>Kim Bui&#45;Burton, California Library Association president and director of the Monterey Public Library, has pointed out that library usage is up across the state and demand is growing for books and other resources, knowledgeable staff assistance and computer/Internet access – despite budget cuts, reduced hours and programs.
</p><p>"Snapshot" statistics will demonstrate to decision makers the extent that students, other library users and future leaders rely on California libraries for critical services, resources and programs – "now, more than ever," Bui&#45;Burton said.

</p><p><strong>Francisco Alarcon among poets at CSUMB on Oct. 28</strong>
</p><p>Francisco Alarcon, Odilia Galvan Rodriguez and Abel Salas will be featured at Voces de Justicia-Voices of Justice, a poetry reading to be held at 7 p.m. Oct. 28 in the University Center ballroom at CSU Monterey Bay. The event is free and open to the public. 
</p><p>Alarcon, award-winning Chicano poet and educator born in Los Angeles, has written 11 volumes of poetry. He teaches at the University of California at Davis, where he directs the Spanish for Native Speakers program.
</p><p>Moved by student protests against Arizona's immigration law, he created a Facebook page called Poets Responding to SB 1070. Many of the poems from the page have been republished on La Bloga at labloga.blogspot.com.
</p><p>He told the Tucson Weekly that he started the Facebook page on April 20, when he saw the demonstration in front of the Arizona State Capitol, and learned that nine students had been arrested.
</p><p>"Those Latino students were sitting in front of the Capitol, very Gandhi-like in nonviolence, protesting the xenophobia of SB 1070," he told the paper. "In response, I wrote a poem, 'For the Capitol Nine.' . . . I posted it on my Facebook page, and I kept getting a lot of responses. Now, we have more than 3,500 members."
</p><p>He added that his Facebook page gets responses about the posted poems from all kinds of writers, all over the world. "That means there are a number of poets who
</p><p>have taken the time and are motivated to respond to this discriminatory law."
</p><p>Galvan Rodriguez and Salas, who work with Alarcon to moderate the Facebook page, will also read their work at CSUMB.
</p><p>Galvan Rodriguez is a poet, writer and teacher. She teaches writing workshops, "Empowering People Through Creative Writing."
</p><p>Salas has written for the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine and is editor and publisher of Brooklyn &amp; Boyle, an L.A. arts, culture and community paper. He occasionally teaches creative writing in Los Angeles County juvenile halls. His poetry has appeared in a variety of publications.
</p><p>All three poets will answer questions and copies of Alarcon's books will be available for purchase. He'll sign copies before and after the reading.
</p><p>The reading is sponsored by the Department of Human Communication, Student Activities and Leadership Development, and the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><p>When Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, arrives, family members of departed souls set out water, candles, food and decorated sugar skulls to welcome their lost loved ones. Widely celebrated in Latin America, the day honors the dead as living entities. It celebrates the departed, and helps keep them present in life.
</p><p>This year's Dia de los Muertos celebration at California State University, Monterey Bay, will be held on Nov. 2.
</p><p>The free event will begin at 6 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue with performances by Aztec dancers and musicians and will include a processional, an outdoor exhibition, live music, pan dulce and hot chocolate. The main altar will be displayed in the University Center ballroom; smaller altars constructed by student and community groups will also be on display.
</p><p>Members of the community are invited to honor the memory of their departed relatives and friends by registering them for the university's Wall of Remembrance. A photo, name and brief memorial message can be submitted at <a href="http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm">http://csumb&#45;archives.github.io/vpa/dead/wall.htm</a>. Photos, which should be submitted in jpg format no larger than 500kb, will be printed and displayed on our Wall of Remembrance and a candle in each name will be placed on the large community altar.

</p><p><strong>UROC PLAYS BIG ROLE IN SUCCESS OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EFFORTS</strong>
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay students took a first&#45;place award and a third at the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science conference Sept. 30&#45;Oct. 3 in Anaheim.
</p><p>Maren Mitch, a McNair Scholar who works in the campus laboratory of Professor Corey Garza, won first prize in the undergraduate poster competition in marine biology. Approximately 60 posters were entered in that category.
</p><p>Mitch &#40;pictured at left&#41; is a senior Environmental Science, Technology and Policy major.
</p><p>According to Dr. Garza, "The judging was razor thin. The deciding factor was the fact that in addition to having a broader understanding of her project's relevance, it was clear to the judges that Maren was conducting her own research as opposed to working on a small part of a larger project."
</p><p>Mitch looked at how to use GIS models to predict the distribution and abundance of sea stars as a function of intertidal habitat complexity in Monterey Bay.
</p><p>Dr. Garza added that the judges were impressed that CSUMB students are able to integrate geospatial technologies into their research as undergraduates.
</p><p>Anthony Basilio, another marine science student, took third place. He is studying fish bio&#45;mechanics at Moss Landing Marine Labs.
</p><p>Both students are part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center. With training and support from UROC, students work on innovative research projects at CSU Monterey Bay and at regional research institutions. Their work is guided by a research mentor and includes training in proposal writing, presentation and communication skills. It also helps students apply to graduate school. <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Learn more about UROC.</a>
</p><p>SACNAS presents the poster sessions at its annual conference to help students prepare for science careers and the rigors of professional conferences.

</p><p>Dr. Jack Tchen, keynote speaker at the Salinas Chinatown: Once and Again Symposium on Oct. 15,  told the gathering of 200 people at CSU Monterey Bay, "We, too, are in search of America."
</p><p>He was referring to the subtitle of John Steinbeck's book, <em>Travels with Charley</em>. "In some ways," he said, "the legacy of Steinbeck's writing is what keeps us going."
</p><p>Dr. Tchen, a historian, professor at New York University and co-founder of New York's Museum of Chinese in America, as well as several other museum professionals and artists were invited to the university to talk about the Salinas Chinatown Cultural Center and Museum, which will be housed in the former Republic Café on Soledad Street. They were joined by university faculty members, students and community members.
</p><p>Dr. Tchen (pictured at right) pointed out that the museum will be important nationally, because it will share a history that is often overlooked. Most Asian cultural museums represent the urban experience. The one in Salinas will cover the rural and agricultural history of the Chinese, Japanese and Filipino communities who lived there from the nineteenth century into the 1950s.
</p><p>Karin Higa, curator of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, advised the group to define "community" broadly as it goes about the work of preparing the museum to open its doors.
</p><p>Wellington Lee, Wally Ahtye, Alfred Baguio and Larry Hirahara – community members with ties to Chinatown ­– talked about their experiences.
</p><p>A plea for community members to share their artifacts and their memories of Chinatown was made by Dr. Lila Staples, who teaches museum studies classes at CSUMB. In collaboration with the National Steinbeck Center, Dr. Staples and her students are assembling the material that will be displayed in the center.
</p><p>The last words came from architect Richard Fe Tom, who drew up the plans for the museum.
</p><p>"You guys are going to get there. It's just a matter of time," he told the group.

</p><p>Andrea Valdez, a senior biology major, is on a microbe mission. Valdez, in conjunction with Dr. Gretchen Hofmann’s lab at UC Santa Barbara, is studying a wasting disease contributing to the recent demise of sea stars, a keystone species in the near&#45;shore environment. Valdez is using molecular techniques to determine the diversity of bacterial organisms found on sea stars with wasting disease, and comparing them to bacterial populations on healthy sea stars.
</p><p>The work, which comprises much of the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program application that Valdez is writing this semester, will contribute to a greater understanding of this complex disease. Valdez began the study in Hofmann’s lab last summer, and continues it this semester in the campus lab of <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/staff/aparna/aparna/Welcome.html">Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan</a>. She is funded in part by the <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu/lsamp">Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation</a> and CSUMB’s <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a>, and hopes to present this project at regional and national conferences this year. She has also found time to serve other students in a variety of ways. She’s an officer in the university’s chapter of Beta Beta Beta, the national biological honor society; helps other students through the Peer&#45;to&#45;Peer Mentor program; works as a teaching assistant for molecular biology and organic chemistry courses; and co&#45;directed last semester’s Undergraduate Research Week events.

</p><h3>CSUMB to host Startup Weekend Jan. 23-25</h3><p>Ever wonder what it takes to be an entrepreneur? CSU Monterey Bay will be a great place to find out when the university hosts Startup Weekend Monterey Bay Jan. 23&#45;25. Startup Weekend will connect local entrepreneurs, developers, designers and startup enthusiasts with mentors and resources. Throughout the course of this 54&#45;hour event, attendees will share ideas, form teams and launch startups.“Startup Weekend is a great way to get into entrepreneurship and test it out, said Mary Jo Zenk, a member of the organizing team. “This event will foster an innovating environment for entrepreneurs to share, vet and launch their ideas.” Here’s how it works: The weekend opens with open mic pitches on Friday, where attendees are encouraged to bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. You don't have to have an idea to attend. Teams form around the top ideas &#40;as deemed by popular vote&#41; and then it’s a 54&#45;hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing and market validation.
</p><p>On Sunday evening, teams demonstrate their prototypes in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback. Startup veterans and mentors – including faculty members and local entrepreneurs – will be on hand throughout the weekend to provide expertise and give talks on their experiences. About 70 people participated in CSUMB’s Startup Weekend in 2014. With the help of 18 coaches and five judges, 10 companies were formed over the weekend.
</p><p>The event is organized by the College of Business’ <a href="http://innovation.csumb.edu">Institute for Innovation and Economic Development.</a> The institute focuses on the need for more job opportunities in the region and offers programs that work toward developing entrepreneurs and supporting innovative ideas that lead to new business opportunities. Participants must purchase a ticket prior to the event. Tickets are currently on sale as Early Bird discounted prices of $75 and $39 for students. Tickets will increase to $99 and $49 after Jan. 3. Each ticket includes registration, meals for the weekend, snacks and parking. <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/monterey&#45;bay/startup&#45;weekend/4824">Register here</a>. The public is invited to attend the final team presentations and judging, and to meet these new entrepreneurs starting at 4 p.m., Sunday, Jan. 25. Tickets are $25 and include dinner. <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/monterey&#45;bay/startup&#45;weekend/4824">Register here</a>.

</p><h3>Sacramento visit to advocate against more budget cuts</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison joined Chancellor Charles Reed and her fellow CSU presidents today in a meeting with Gov. Jerry Brown in Sacramento to discuss the state budget and its impact on higher education.
</p><p>Like her counterparts, Harrison was accompanied at the meeting by a local business leader, Mary Ann Leffel, president of the Monterey County Business Council.
</p><p>Harrison said she was encouraged by Brown's continued commitment to avoiding an "all-cuts" budget for fiscal year 2011-2012, which could mean a $1 billion reduction in funding for the CSU.
</p><p>"The governor clearly understands how devastating an all-cuts budget would be to our universities and to the people of California," Harrison said. "We are all looking to the Legislature to fulfill its responsibilities and support the extension of needed revenue."
</p><p>Brown's proposed budget contains a $500 million cut to the CSU, which would result in a deep $5.1 million funding cut to CSUMB. If necessary state taxes are not extended, an additional system-wide cut of up to $500 million would force the CSU to increase tuition up to an additional 32 percent and possibly close admissions for 2012.
</p><p>Harrison said the debate over extending the taxes is more philosophical than financial – a fundamental choice about whether California should maintain its investment in such basic services as higher education and public safety.
</p><p>"If we're not going to invest in these things, then we will have to deal with the ramifications," she said.
</p><p>Leffel, who emphasized the role of higher education in preparing a workforce to meet local needs, said a decline in state support means that more qualified students will be shut out of the state's public universities.
</p><p>"Educating fewer students will slow our economic recovery and ultimately lead to a smaller tax base,” she said.  
</p><h2>Ejan headed to Washington, D.C.</h2><p>Jihan Ejan, a retention adviser with the Center for Student Success at CSU Monterey Bay, was chosen to participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Kika de la Garza Education Fellowship Program this summer in Washington, D.C.
</p><p>The program is named for the Texas Congressman and former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. It is part of the USDA’s Hispanic-Serving Institutions program.
</p><p>Ejan is one of 13 college and university faculty and staff members chosen for this year’s program. Fellows experience first-hand the education policymaking process and build linkages to research and funding opportunities. In addition to meeting with USDA personnel, fellows connect with and work on short-term projects with other federal agencies and organizations such as the Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Commerce Department, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
</p><p>She will be in Washington from June 26 through July 16.
</p><p>“The opportunity to be a Fellow will further my understanding of the educational challenges and career opportunities facing the Latino community,” Ejan said. “With this information, I hope to be a better advocate and adviser. The fellowship will give me ideas on how to better serve our students.”
</p><p>Ejan joined the university in July of 2010. She earned bachelor’s degrees in sociology and Asian American Studies from UC Davis and a master’s degree in counseling with an emphasis in college student personnel counseling from San Francisco State University.
</p><p>Her work experience includes academic and career counseling, mentoring, college retention, college outreach and recruitment, admissions evaluations and teaching. She has worked with students at all levels – from elementary school through university. She previously worked at CSU Channel Islands, UC Berkeley, City College of San Francisco, and for the nonprofit League of United Latin American Citizens National Educational Service Centers, Inc.
</p><h3>Dining Commons event raises more than $1,000</h3><p>It seems that people and food come together in times of great tragedy.
</p><p>After the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of Japan, Aya Kamata, an international student from that country, contacted Campus Dining at CSU Monterey Bay with the idea of featuring Japanese cuisine as a fundraising opportunity.
</p><p>Kamata and Sodexo, the university's food service provider, had worked together in the fall semester when her entry in the “Favorites from Home” contest was selected as one of the winners. She had submitted a recipe for tonkatsu, a meal traditionally served in Japan before a major competition – such as an exam or sports event.
</p><p>Charles Wesley, campus general manager for Sodexo, readily agreed to the idea. As a result, Tuesday, March 29, was designated Japanese Relief Day. Food from that country was offered all day in the Dining Commons. Fifty percent of cash sales  – on all food sold, not just the Japanese dishes – was donated to the relief effort. By the end of the day, more than $1,000 had been raised.
</p><p>During the lunch and dinner hours that day, visitors to the Dining Commons were able to get a lesson in origami (Japanese paper folding), get their name written in Japanese characters and learn some basic facts about the country.
</p><p>Japanese exchange students at CSUMB, as well as students in the Japan Club and the International Club began raising money to help victims almost immediately after news reports broke. By March 17, when most students left campus for spring break, $700 had been raised. That money was  donated to the Japan Democratic Medical Organization. Donations are still being collected at various locations around campus.

</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay now offers a Professional Science Master’s degree in Coastal and Watershed Science &amp; Policy. The new program complements the traditional, thesis-based master of science degree in applied marine and watershed science that has been offered at CSUMB for five years.
</p><p>The “plus” element includes a professional internship and training in advanced geospatial technologies; professional and scientific communication; scientific ethics; and environmental economics and policy analysis.
</p><p>Students typically do their internships in the second year, or over the summer between the first and second years of the program. Some work on campus in the Seafloor Mapping Lab and the Institute for Applied Marine Ecology. Others work with government agencies such as NASA and the U.S. Forest Service, as well as with environmental consulting groups and non-profit agencies.
</p><p>Sixteen students are enrolled this semester. “We capped it at 16 because we wanted to be able to place them in the best internships,” said Dr. Susan Alexander, director of the program.
</p><p>“Students find this new option appealing because of the ability to link applied marine and watershed science to professional skills and jobs,” she said.
</p><p>“Many of the students we’re seeing are returning professionals. They have several years of work experience and are looking to gain advanced scientific and technical skills that will help them move forward in their careers.”
</p><p>Academic research groups, government agencies and non-profits are likely to employ these graduates, but the program will also address the needs of regional “green” business and consulting firms.
</p><p> 
</p><p> 
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay volleyball coach Jody Garry says this year’s squad is “not afraid to lose.” As the 2010 season continues, it is very clear they aren’t afraid to win, either.
</p><p>The Otters piled up a 10-2 record by early October, earning a no. 21 national ranking and demonstrating the chemistry that Garry strives for.
</p><p>“We’re playing as a team and not as six individuals on the court,” said junior Rheann Fall, an outside hitter from Elk Grove, who on Sept. 21 was named NCAA Division II National Player of the Week by the American Volleyball Coaches Association.
</p><p>Fall’s strong performance in the season’s opening weeks was capped by her school-record 29 kills in the Otters’ thrilling 3-2 victory over No. 11-ranked UC San Diego. A kill is a spiked shot that is not returned by the other team, resulting in a point.
</p><p>Even with the Otters’ strong start this season, Garry said she’s equally excited about the team’s future, thanks to a strong recruiting effort that brought in four promising freshmen, including three from the Monterey-San Jose region.
</p><p>“Yes, we’re going to do well this year,” she said, reflecting back on last year’s 13-19 record. “But we’re going to get better and better and better. It’s not a quick fix. I’m not a quick fix coach.”
</p><p>Garry credits the success of CSUMB volleyball camps, including free Youth Otter Clinics this spring for youngsters in eighth grade and under, paid for with grant funds.
</p><p>Through the camps, the recruits had a chance to meet her and the returning players, as well as spend time on campus.
</p><p>“They knew me; they knew my program,” said Garry, who is now in her fourth season at CSUMB. “They assimilated so well. The key is to have that relationship.”
</p><p>The Otters can’t match most conference opponents in size or strength, she said, so they have to be smarter.
</p><p>“They’re not the biggest, they’re not the fastest,” Garry said. “They’re just kids who are willing to put the work in.”

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay's first class of 10 nursing graduates participated in a pinning ceremony on Dec. 20. The ceremony marked a milestone for the students and for the university. – &#42;Monterey Herald&#42;, Dec. 31, 2014
</p><p>Generations of California elementary school students have visited the adobe missions that dot the state from San Diego to Sonoma. The 21 missions, begun in 1769 by Father Junipero Serra, had a big impact on Dr. Ruben Mendoza.
</p><p>“My interest in history started on a fourth-grade field trip from my home in Fresno to Mission San Juan Bautista,” Dr. Mendoza explained. “I fell in love with it, but I wanted to know more.”
</p><p>That school trip ignited a lifelong passion.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza went on to earn an undergraduate degree from CSU Bakersfield and graduate degrees in archaeology at the University of Arizona. He came to CSU Monterey Bay as a founding faculty member in 1995.
</p><p>A chance meeting with the pastor of Mission San Juan Bautista resulted in an invitation to work there. That was 15 years ago. Since then, he’s worked at many of the California missions, as well as some in the American Southwest and Mexico. Dr. Mendoza is also a charter board member of the California Missions Foundation. He’s become the local go-to expert on the subject and one of only a handful of mission archaeology and conservation specialists in California.
</p><p>Students in CSUMB’s Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies can pursue a concentration in archaeology. Each year, 15 to 20 students do so, many of them attracted by the prospect of working with Dr. Mendoza. Some continue on to graduate school. Public agencies and contractors hire others. Because much of the California coast is archaeologically sensitive, contractors need trained people to determine whether an area under construction is historically significant.
</p><h5>Hands-on-learning</h5><p>When asked what appeals to students about the subject, Dr. Mendoza has a ready answer. “They see it as sexy, interesting ... the ‘Indiana Jones’ mystique. My job is to demystify the field,” he said. He may “demystify” it, but he does it in a way that attracts students.
</p><p>Adrian Lopez, a 2007 graduate of CSUMB, is pursuing a master’s degree in urban and regional planning at San José State University, focusing on historic preservation. That interest is the result of Lopez’s work at the Soledad Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista and the Royal Presidio Chapel in Monterey while enrolled in Dr. Mendoza’s classes.
</p><p>“He’s involved with students in a very direct way,” Lopez said. “He’s an educator, a motivator and an inspiration. He inspired me to continue my education.”
</p><p>When they work with him at the missions, students take on specific community service projects. Some of what they do involves answering questions from the public, conducting tours and installing museum exhibits. They also do fieldwork, learning to identify, catalog and interpret their findings through the science of archaeology, and they learn about public service.
</p><p>“There’s nothing better than putting them in the field for hands-on work,” Dr. Mendoza said.
</p><p>Brenna Wheelis enrolled in his Mission Archaeology class in 2007 to fulfill a Service Learning requirement. “I was hooked. I completed over 160 Service Learning hours that semester,” she said, well beyond what she needed.
</p><p>Since graduating last spring, Wheelis has been part of the excavation and recovery of a Native American burial site in Carmel Valley, and she co-authored a historic structures report on the 1932 Maryknoll Rectory at Mission San Juan Bautista with Dr. Mendoza. Many of his students are cited in his scholarly publications for their contributions to the work.
</p><p>“He’s highly accessible to his students,” Wheelis said, “and never discourages their curiosity. He takes a genuine interest in what his students think ... and creates a curriculum that develops individual scholarship. He’s had a tremendous influence on my decision to apply to graduate school in order to pursue archaeology as a career.”
</p><h5>"Column of light"</h5><p>Digging into the missions’ past is more than an academic exercise or teaching tool for Dr. Mendoza. He believes that knowing what went on there helps us understand who we are today, and how California became what it is.
</p><p>Asked to name the most significant work he’s done, he didn’t hesitate.
</p><p>“Discovering the Serra chapels at the Royal Presidio of Monterey,” he said. He’s referring to the discoveries in the summer of 2008 of the “first” and “second” chapels, each consisting of rectangular adobe buildings located directly in front of the present San Carlos Cathedral (constructed in 1791-95). The area marks the spot where, in 1770, Father Junipero Serra celebrated the earliest Mass in a formally constructed church on the California coast.
</p><p>“And the solstice studies are turning out to be a big thing. It’s like a Dan Brown novel,” he said, referring to the author of ‘The Da Vinci Code.’
</p><p>“I’m looking at symbology, iconography and ancient secrets. I’ve got competitors, I’ve got collaborators.”
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza has documented that 12 missions in California alone are aligned to mark the winter or summer solstice. The solar geometry was first brought to his attention on the morning of Dec. 21, 1997, at Mission San Juan Bautista by the pastor, when the altar was bathed in sunlight, casting what he calls “an intense column of light” directly on the tabernacle. He is convinced it’s the result of a deliberate design by the Spanish missionaries who built the missions.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza predicted and documented a similar illumination at Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Carmel on the summer solstice on June 21, 2003. He has gone on to document scores of other solstice and feast day sites in the American Southwest and Mexico and presented his findings before the Society for American Archaeology in St. Louis this April.
</p><p>The public will have an opportunity to learn more about Dr. Mendoza’s work at Mission San Juan Bautista. PBS television plans a documentary on the archaeology, historiography and conservation efforts there.
</p><p>Mission study is an emerging field, he said: “There’s so much that’s unknown. Many records have not yet been scrutinized. We’re in a post-colonial era. What happened in the colonial era?
</p><p>“No answer you give in this moment will hold in the next moment. For me, that’s exciting,” he said. “When I see the fourth-graders at the mission ... I do this for them.”
</p><p>Fortune shone on Stacy Mauzey of Salinas the day in 2009 when she met Carolee Bull. "Without Dr. Bull's help, I wouldn't be where I am today," Mauzey said. "Working with her has proven to be consciousness-raising."

</p><p>Twenty&#45;nine students and two faculty members from CSU Monterey Bay are preparing income taxes for free during the next few months at various locations around the area through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program. VITA is coordinated by the United Way of Monterey County.
</p><p>The volunteer tax&#45;preparers took training classes over the semester break and were certified by the IRS through an exam before beginning to work with clients. The student volunteers come from the university's School of Business. Most are in the accounting concentration; some are satisfying their service&#45;learning requirement.
</p><p>The service is available at four locations in Salinas, and in Seaside, Castroville, Soledad and King City. Some students also work at locations in Santa Cruz County.
</p><p>This is the second year that business students and faculty members are volunteering with the program. Approximately $100,000 in income tax refunds was returned to clients, and by extension, the local community, as a result of their work last year.
</p><p>Susan Morse, service&#45;learning instructor in the School of Business, is “always looking for ways to incorporate community involvement addressing issues of justice, culture and equity with activities that use and expand students’ business skills,” she said. “VITA does both.”
</p><p>Accounting professor Cathy Ku was also involved with recruiting students and coordinating the various agencies involved.
</p><p>The program reaches out to low&#45;income wage earners who can’t afford income tax preparation assistance or are not aware that they may be eligible for tax refunds. To be eligible for the program, household income must be less than $49,000.
</p><p>“The community also benefits from an infusion of otherwise lost income as the refunds are, for the most part, spent locally,” Morse said.

</p><h2>Meatless Monday returns to campus</h2><p>If you're thinking of having a burger for lunch at CSU Monterey Bay – and it's a Monday – you might want to reconsider that choice.
</p><p>An initiative by Sodexo, the university's food service provider, is highlighting meatless options at all five campus dining locations every Monday during the school year. They're making it easy for diners to abstain from eating meat one day a week.
</p><p>If you're a carnivore and you've already scarfed down a double cheeseburger, don't worry. You're not in trouble. It's voluntary.
</p><p>"The idea isn't to take any choices away," said Tyler McBrian, Sodexo's campus marketing and sustainability manager. "The idea is to add vegetarian options and to make them visible," he said.
</p><p>Sodexo is doing that by featuring a special serving station for vegetarian fare in the Dining Commons.
</p><p>In addition, the library café features veggie hummus wraps, the Otter Express offers veggie sandwiches and the Otter Bay Restaurant has a new Meatless Monday option every week.
</p><p>The company's website says it is offering more vegetarian fare to improve students' health and reduce their environmental impact.
</p><p>"Did you know that it takes 2,500 gallons of water to make one pound of beef," McBrian asks people.
</p><p>The Meatless Monday trend is sweeping through learning institutions from elementary to graduate schools. Pioneers include UC Davis, Yale University and the Baltimore City schools.
</p><p>Dozens of colleges and universities now highlight meatless options each week, according to Sodexo. Many of the efforts to bring Meatless Monday to campuses were student&#45;led, a testament to increased awareness about the connections between diet and overall health. Each college has added its own promotion style to the campaign, including videos, Facebook pages and pledge drives.
</p><p>And it's not just schools that have signed on to the idea.
</p><p>When celebrity chef Mario Batali starts to push people to eat their vegetables, you know something is happening. The famous chef and restaurant owner has joined the Meatless Monday movement, which is backed by a broad array of public&#45;health advocates.
</p><p>In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a study of fruit and vegetable consumption. It found that only 26 percent of adults eat vegetables three or more times a day – which falls far short of guidelines set by the federal government. When it comes to fruits and vegetables, the average American eats less than half of what public health officials suggest. And that figure hasn't budged since 2000.
</p><p>Nor is the idea new. During World War I, people were urged to skip meat one day a week as a rationing effort. Now, that idea has been reinvented as a hip, easy way to be environmentally friendly and health conscious.

</p><p>Oct. 26, 2010  A redesigned website for Cal State Monterey Bay debuted on Oct. 25, after more than a year of work by members of the Strategic Communications and Information Technology departments and an outside contractor, White Whale Web Services of Oakland.
</p><p>Dozens of staff members and students gathered for the official launch in the University Center Living Room. President Dianne Harrison cut the ribbon that “launched” the site. “Today is an exciting day for our campus,” Dr. Harrison told the group. “This is a massive undertaking. Our website reflects who we are, what our identity is, what kind of research our faculty and students are doing . . . the website reflects the personality of the campus.” She quoted an Information Technology student as saying: “ ‘I feel like this website reflects me as a student.’ And that’s the best thing that can be said.” Chief Information Officer Chip Lenno explained that the site was created using open source software. “As of today, we have contributed more than 25,000 lines of code back to the open-source community,” he said with obvious pride. The president and founder of White Whale, Jason Pontius, was complimentary of CSUMB’s web team. “We work with a number of colleges and universities, and I have never in my career worked with a team of people who were as calm, confident and prepared for this re-design,” he told the gathering, singling out Elizabeth MacDonald, Kevin Miller, Kevin Garcia and Greg Pool by name. “The code has been masterful . . . ,” he added, a reference to Miller’s work. In addition to the people Pontius named, many others worked behind the scenes to make the redesign successful, including Joan Iguban and Molly Nance of Strategic Communications, Paul Hall of IT and student assistant Chi Tran. The redesigned site features work contributed by members of the campus community, including student-produced photos and videos. The site has also been geared for ease of use, with a blend of need-to-know information and room to click around and discover unexpected stories about the university, and its students and faculty.
</p><h3>Photographer Jeff Sheng lectures at CSUMB Nov. 30</h3><p>The President’s Speaker Series resumes Nov. 30 when photographer Jeff Sheng visits campus. His talk will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater.
</p><p>Sheng, an artist who teaches Asian American studies and photography at UC Santa Barbara, will talk about his work, which deals with sexuality and homophobia. He’ll also talk about his experiences as an activist of color.
</p><p>He’ll present “Fearless,” a series of photos he has worked on since 2003 that depict lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender high school and college athletes who are open about their sexuality.
</p><p>“Fearless” was shown at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and, in the last four years, has toured more than 40 colleges and high schools. It’s exhibited mostly in student centers and gymnasiums – high traffic areas that allow a large audience to see the photos.
</p><p>He’ll also talk about his recent series of photos depicting closeted members of the military, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” In 2008, when “Fearless” was first featured in the national media, Sheng received e-mails from service members, saying they had been moved by the photos. He realized he had found his next project.
</p><p>“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is a series of portraits of gay men and lesbians, all of them shown in uniform but with their faces obscured in some way. In one image, an airman sits on a hotel bed, his hand cupping his face to shield it from the lens. The portrait conveys a sense of isolation and loneliness. It’s the image that landed on the book cover, and in Time magazine last February.
</p><p>He traveled around the country to interview and photograph military personnel. At first, he paid his own expenses; later, he was helped by a grant.
</p><p>While the “Fearless” photos were shot on film, Sheng used a digital camera for “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” That way, he could show his subjects their pictures right away – and so, he told the New York Times, help build their trust.
</p><p>He describes his subjects, identified only by pseudonyms, as people who didn’t want to risk their careers, but wanted to take some kind of stand.
</p><p>The photos have attracted national attention and have been featured in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, ABC World News, Time magazine, NPR and the BBC, among other media outlets.
</p><p>“I think photographs have the power to move people that sometimes words don't," Sheng says. "And you look at these images and what you see is that people who are gay look very similar, the same, as people you would assume to be straight. That's a powerful message.”
</p><p>In conjunction with the lecture, “Fearless” will be exhibited on campus. From Nov. 8-19, the photos can be seen in the University Center on Sixth Avenue during normal business hours. From Nov. 22-30, the photos will be displayed in the lobby of the World Theater. Please call the theater at (831) 582-4580 for exhibit times.
</p><p>The lecture and exhibit are free. Reservations for the lecture are recommended and can be made online at csumb.edu/speakers. For more information, or to request disability accommodations, call (831) 582-4580.  
</p><p>The dozen students who were selected to receive scholarships from the Fort Ord Alumni Association cover the spectrum of academic majors available at Cal State Monterey Bay: human communication; business; liberal studies; global studies; teledramatic arts and technology; environmental science, technology and policy; health and human services; marine science; kinesiology.
</p><p>And they aspire to varied careers: sports journalist; pharmacist; public relations practitioner; master chef; teacher; filmmaker; environmental engineer; nurse; scientist; physical therapist.
</p><p>One plans to study abroad; two are members of the university’s athletic teams; some come from military families or have been on active duty; all have served their communities in some way.
</p><p>What the 12 students have in common is the ability to embrace the opportunities that life offers. The awards, which were given at the association’s annual luncheon on Oct. 27, bring to 112 the total number of scholarships – all in the amount of $1,000 – given by FOAA since its scholarship program began. The Fort Ord Alumni Association was established in 1996 – shortly after the university opened its doors on a portion of the former Army base – to provide financial assistance to students and to honor and preserve the heritage of Fort Ord and the contributions of the soldiers, civilians and their families who lived and worked there. Membership is open to anyone who wishes to join in these efforts. This year, more than 140 scholarship applications were received. Grade-point average, leadership, participation in extra-curricular activities and volunteer work at school or in the local community were considered in the evaluation process. Recipients and the scholarships they were awarded:

</p><p>Huddled over a gray robot, a student pushed the start button and watched as the small machine lurched forward, completed a turn and moved toward an obstacle.
</p><p>Then disaster struck. The robot veered off course, driving over white masking tape and spinning around several times – disqualifying the team that programmed it.
</p><p>It was back to the computer for a team of students in the First Year Seminar: Otter DotCom class.
</p><p>The class is part of Project Higher Ground, a program where students live in the same dormitory (in this case, Avocet Hall) and take at least two classes together.
</p><p>The 25 students in the class formed themselves into eight teams. Each team assembled a Lego Mindstorm robot, then programmed it via computer “to do what we want,” one student explained.
</p><p>The teams competed on a recent Thursday morning. Each team’s bot covered two courses. One was an oval-shaped track (think NASCAR); the robots had to stay inside a set of parallel lines marked off with masking tape. The other course was oddly shaped and was covered twice, once with obstacles obstructing the way, the other obstacle-free.
</p><p>The competitive part of it clearly engaged the students.
</p><p>“We even made a test track in the lobby of their dorm, so they could practice over the weekend when the lab was locked,” said Dr. Kate Lockwood, assistant professor of Computer Science and Information Technology.
</p><p>Team No. 4 – whose robot was named “Cookie” – was the overall winner. Team members Megan Louth, Ryan Lorea and Chris Carpenter piloted Cookie to victory on the oval track, and covered the obstacle course – successfully avoiding the pair of obstacles placed in its way – in 42.3 seconds to top that race as well.
</p><p>Winner of the obstacle-free race was Team No. 5, whose robot was named “Yellow” (for the color of the Lego box, they said). Members of the team: Gonzalo Sanchez, Brayant Galvez and Ben Fulanovich.
</p><p>If you’re interested in robots, there’ll be another opportunity to see them in competition.
</p><p>In mid-December, students in Dr. Sathya Narayanan’s computer architecture class will face off with sumo wrestling robots they have assembled, wired and programmed.
</p><p>Art historian Laura Meyer comes to campus on Nov. 10 as the visiting artist lecture series continues.
</p><p>Dr. Meyer is the author of “A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Experiment,” and organized an exhibition and symposium on that theme last year at Fresno State University. Her work documents the nation’s first feminist art education program, which was established at Fresno State in 1970, and its enduring legacy in contemporary art. Meeting off campus in a Studio of Their Own, 15 female students and instructor Judy Chicago helped pioneer key strategies of the early feminist art movement, including collaboration, the use of “female technologies” such as costume, performance, and video, and early forms of media critique.
</p><p>Many art history textbooks trace the roots of feminist art education in the U.S. to the program established by Chicago and Miriam Schapiro at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, overlooking its beginnings at Fresno State the previous year. “A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Experiment” highlights previously undocumented painting, sculpture, photography, film, installation, and performance art produced during the first year of the Fresno experiment, as well as recent work by program participants. Together, all helped lay the groundwork for what one critic has called “a whole new relationship between art and society.” Dr. Meyer earned an MFA in painting from CSU Los Angeles and a Ph.D. in art history from UCLA. She is an associate professor of modern and contemporary art at Fresno State. The event, sponsored by the Department of Visual and Public Art, will start with a reception at 6 p.m., followed by the lecture at 6:30 in the University Center living room. The public is invited. No reservations are needed for this free event.
</p><p>Earl Lawson was sworn in as the chief of police at Cal State Monterey Bay on Nov. 2, three weeks after university President Dianne Harrison named him to the position.
</p><p>Several dozen members of local law enforcement agencies joined the campus community to witness Nate Johnson, chief law enforcement officer for the California State University system, administer the traditional oath of office.
</p><p>Lawson’s wife, America, pinned the chief’s badge on while their daughter, Brianna, looked on.
</p><p>Lawson has served in a number of important roles since joining the University Police Department in 1995, most recently as operations lieutenant and briefly as interim police chief upon the retirement of former chief Fred Hardee in June.
</p><p>Dr. Harrison said Lawson was selected for the breadth of his experience, which includes special training in disaster preparedness and collaboration with local law enforcement. “Chief Lawson understands that the police department is essential to ensuring a safe environment for our students, employees and visitors and helping to maintain an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and personal growth,” she said. “I know he will do an outstanding job.” Praise came from Chief Johnson, who called Lawson “an out-of-the-box thinker who sees the big picture.” In his brief remarks, Lawson reiterated his commitment to the university. “This is my home; the people on this campus are my extended family. I’m heavily invested in the success of this university,” he said. His top priorities are to expand the university’s emergency preparedness and community policing programs. He promised to be “accessible and flexible,” and to “always do what I think is right for the community.” Lawson has a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Cal Poly Pomona and a minor certificate in criminal justice. His extensive professional education includes training at the FBI National Academy. He started his law enforcement career in 1993.

</p><h4>Slack key maestro George Kahumoku presents holiday concert</h4><p>“Slackheads” will get a rare treat on Dec. 11, when Grammy-winning slack-key guitarist George Kahumoku brings a bit of the islands to Cal State Monterey Bay’s World Theater for a Hawaiian holiday show.
</p><p>And in the true spirit of Hawaiian family tradition, Kahumoku will be joined on stage by his wife and son, Keoki, an accomplished musician and entertainer.
</p><p>The performance isn’t just for transplanted Hawaiians. It’s a chance for lovers of diverse music to hear a style that – despite a rich tradition – isn’t all that well known on the mainland.
</p><p>Slack-key performances have a laid-back Hawaiian feel, with performers “talking story” between songs, spinning yarns and tales from back home.
</p><p>In contrast to many Hawaiian traditions, the slack-key guitar style is a relatively recent invention. Spanish and Mexican cowboys introduced the acoustic guitar to the islands in 1830. The Hawaiians quickly developed their own style of playing, which became known as slack key.
</p><p>The term refers to a finger-picking guitar style, in which one or more strings are loosened – slacked – to change the tuning. The guitarist can then play the bass and treble parts of the music, which makes it sound as if several guitars are playing at once. One result is a ringing sound that lingers behind the melodies being picked.
</p><p>And Kahumoku is one of the best. He’s been called Hawaii’s Renaissance man, and with good reason. He’s a songwriter, performer, high school and college teacher, artist, sculptor, storyteller, writer, farmer and entrepreneur.
</p><p>He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. Following a stint working on the Alaska pipeline, he returned to Maui, where he teaches drawing, painting, ceramics, guitar and ukulele at a high school and at Maui Community College. When he’s not teaching, he’s working on his three-acre farm, tending his goats, chickens and ducks and growing vegetables and fruit. He’s a busy man. Kahumoku’s music and voice have been described as "earthy and organic – one with the `aina (the land)." His love and respect for Hawaii and planet Earth are embedded in his music, which he likes to think of as nature songs: songs of love, hope, desire, and lament.
</p><p>He’s played for Elizabeth Taylor; for 15 years, Henry “the Fonz” Winkler requested his presence at his new Year’s Eve parties; he’s even played for the Queen of England.
</p><p>In a 2002 interview with Santa Cruz’s weekly publication, Good Times, he said, “This music gives you a sense of balance, completeness, even to the guy that’s playing it as well as the listener; . . . you feel that <em>one</em>, almost with the universe."
</p><p>Bring the entire family for this evening of story, song and dance from the enchanting islands. Tickets range from $10 to $33 and can be purchased by calling the World Theater box office at (831) 582-4580 or online at csumb.edu/worldtheater. The World Theater is located on Sixth Avenue on the CSUMB campus. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h4>Former Army medic pursuing degree in health and human services</h4><p>Heather Cusson’s local roots run deep, but a circuitous route brought her to Cal State Monterey Bay. She grew up in Carmel Valley. Her father was stationed at Fort Ord during the Vietnam War. Her uncle graduated from CSU Monterey Bay. And now Cusson, 26, is a junior transfer student at the university, majoring in Collaborative Health and Human Services. She hopes one day to be a public health nurse — a dream backed up by two tours in Afghanistan as an Army medic. Her experience in Afghanistan — administering medical care to locals in remote villages, assisting in the treatment of gunshot wounds, amputations, burns and blast injuries to American soldiers — reinforced her passion to pursue a career in health care. When she returned to the U.S., she hoped to find a job as a trauma specialist but her lack of formal education in the field prevented that. Instead, she enrolled in Monterey Peninsula College. “Like most veterans, I was unaware of services that were available for someone in my situation. But thanks to the help of the veterans’ representatives at Monterey Peninsula College and CSUMB, I was guided down the right educational path,” she said. After earning an associate’s degree in 2010, she applied to MPC’s Maurine Church Coburn School of Nursing. When she realized that the school has a three-year waiting list, she decided to pursue a bachelor’s degree at CSUMB in the interim. “I believe the CHHS department really promotes making a positive impact in the community. A career in health and human services will provide me with a sense of service, similar to what I felt in the Army,” she said. Transition from Army life to civilian life has been challenging for Cusson. There’s a lack of the “Army family” she once knew so well. Luckily for her, she has support from her brother and husband, both veterans. And the fact that CSUMB is on the grounds of the former Fort Ord Army base is helping her, too. With former military buildings around campus, Cusson is reminded of her days at Fort Drum, N.Y., where she was stationed. “Having my classes in these kinds of buildings is welcoming. I also enjoy taking the time to observe the footprints left behind by fellow soldiers,” she said. At CSUMB, Cusson is in the company of other veterans. Last spring, 53 CSUMB student veterans were using various GI Bill benefits (38 of them using the new Post 9/11 GI Bill) and another 20 were using the Dependents Educational Assistance program as eligible dependents of veterans. And 89 students were eligible for the College Fee Waiver Program for Veterans' Dependents through the California Department of Veterans Affairs. These students, as family members of disabled or deceased veterans, receive a waiver of fees. This fall, 48 students are using the Post 9/11 GI Bill program. Among the university’s military-friendly practices are web pages with information specifically for veterans; a specially designated counselor and support team to help veterans make the transition from active duty service to accomplishing their personal educational goals; and a Student Veterans Organization that is currently in the planning stages. Cusson knows she is surrounded by people and resources that will keep her on the right track to obtain her dream job. “As far as the everyday transition, I’m still confronting issues of post-traumatic stress. However, I feel like I’m lucky to live in a community that acknowledges and supports my struggles as a veteran,” Cusson said. <em>– By Molly Nance, University Advancement</em>
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay can claim to be one of the best places to work in the county – for the second time in three years.
</p><p>That’s according to the Monterey County Business Council's “Best Places to Work” study. The purpose of the program is to provide vital information to local companies about the practices they use to attract and retain talented employees.
</p><p>Employers were recognized in two categories – those with 75 or fewer employees and those with more than 75. Two organizations in each category were honored.
</p><p>More than 40 businesses applied for the awards. Winners in the small business category were Medialocate, a language-services company, and the Central Coast Federal Credit Union. Robert Mann Packaging joined CSUMB as a winner in the large-employer division.
</p><p>Personal Dynamics Consulting of Florida designed a 40-question survey used to identify the top employers. Turnover rates, growth percentages, spending on employee development, insurance packages and retirement plans were among the 37 measurements used to determine the area’s “Best Places to Work.”
</p><p>CSUMB President Dianne Harrison accepted the award on Sept. 24.
</p><p>The Monterey County Business Council includes professionals from business, government and education working together on countywide issues. Founded in 1995, the nonprofit corporation seeks to promote the concept of private-public partnerships by bringing business experience and techniques to the public arena.
</p><p>The Nov. 13 performance of December People at the World Theater was sold out, with standing room only. Another high point of the evening was the success of the theater’s food drive.
</p><p>The drive was a collaboration between the World Theater and radio station HIPPO 104.3 FM. Food for people and pets was collected and donated to the food banks of Monterey and San Benito counties and the Monterey County SPCA. The World Theater lobby was filled with an estimated 2,000 lbs. of donated food to help those in need during the holiday season.
</p><p>“Because of the fantastic audience response and the food drive, the producers plan to bring December People and the canned food drive back again next year,” said Joe Cardinalli, director of the World Theater.
</p><p>Over at Campus Dining services, through the generosity of CSUMB students, staff and faculty, and the sponsorship of Sodexo, the Helping Hands Food Drive netted 965 lbs. of food in time for needy families at Thanksgiving. The food was donated to the Food Bank for Monterey County.
</p><p>The drive is an annual event put on every October and November by Sodexo. This year, students could donate meal plan blocks which campus dining converted into food. The food was converted into bulk items such as bags of rice, cake and brownie mix, canned milk and vegetables.
</p><p>“On the last day of the food drive, Otter Athletics joined in and asked community members to donate canned food for admission to the women's basketball game,” said Jennifer Harris, marketing and  sustainability manager for Sodexo campus dining. “They added nearly 200 lbs of food in one night.”
</p><p>Due to the support from the campus community and Otter Athletics, the Helping Hands Food Drive donated nine times more food than last year.  
</p><p>A donor wall, memorializing the contributions of significant donors to the university, was unveiled Oct. 9 at the Alumni &amp; Visitors Center during an annual dinner in appreciation of the university’s largest donors.
</p><p>The wall contains the names of 120 donors, both individuals and organizations, with room for many more to be added in the years to come. Each name signifies a cumulative donation of $25,000 or more. The wall lists various “society” giving levels, ranging from $25,000 to over the $10 million level.
</p><p>“The donor wall will be updated with new names each year,” said Pilar Gose, annual giving officer in University Advancement. “When the wall was unveiled at the donor dinner, the guests who were recognized for their generosity really loved it.”
</p><p>An existing donor wall in the lobby of the University Center also lists donations, but it has not been updated since 2006. It will remain there, but will no longer be the memorial of record for future contributions.  
</p><h4>Local resources for parents, teachers is topic of Dec. 1 event</h4><p>With the diagnosis rate estimated to be 1 in 110 children, it’s imperative that parents and teachers of students with autism know what local resources are available.
</p><p>That topic will be addressed at Cal State Monterey Bay on Dec. 1 when the university’s chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children and the state CEC sponsor a free panel discussion from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in the University Center on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>“Meeting the Needs of Students with Autism: Community Perspectives” will feature panelists Laura Harris, executive director of local nonprofit Special Kids Crusade; Stella Lauerman, community services manager of Easter Seals Central California; and Marcia Weber-Olsen, program specialist with Monterey County’s Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).
</p><p>Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor of special education at CSUMB, will be the moderator.
</p><p>Students, parents, teachers and community members with an interest in autism are invited to attend. A light dinner will be provided.
</p><p>Please RSVP to Jacquelline Means at 582-4612. For more information, contact Dr. Cathi Draper Rodriguez at 582-3652.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><h3>President's speaker series continues Jan. 30</h3><p>“America Fast Forward?: Demographic Shifts, Economic Challenges, and the Future of California” will be the topic addressed by University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor on Jan. 30, when the President’s Speaker Series resumes at Cal State Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The social and economic changes in California in the last few decades foreshadowed what is now happening in the nation as a whole; indeed, the demographic change in the state between 1980 and 2000 is what the U.S. is projected to experience between 2000 and 2050.
</p><p>In our passage, rising immigration, widening inequality, and a strained fiscal system challenged the state &#40;and now the nation&#41;, but we are now at a critical turnaround as our demography stabilizes, our economy catches its breath, and public finances are finally on &#40;slightly&#41; firmer ground.
</p><p>What’s ahead for the Golden State? How do we ensure economic, social and environmental sustainability for the next generation of Californians? And what are the lessons for a nation experiencing widening divides by income, geography and politics?
</p><p>Dr. Pastor is a professor of sociology and American Studies &amp; Ethnicity at USC. He directs the university’s Program for Environmental and Regional Equity and the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. His research focuses on movement building and the economic, environmental and social conditions facing low&#45;income communities.
</p><p>He has written several books and speaks nationally on issues including demographic change, economic inequality, and community empowerment.
</p><p>His presentation will start at 3:30 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue near A Street. A question&#45;and&#45;answer session and a public reception will follow. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>The community is invited to this free event. No tickets are necessary, but reservations are requested. Please RSVP by calling the World Theater box office at 582&#45;4580 or going <a href="http://csumb.edu/rsvp">online</a>.
</p><p>The theme of this year’s speaker series is “Future Monterey Bay.” During the school year, three speakers will visit campus to address various aspects of the theme. The series kicked off in November with a talk by Stanford University professor and futurist Paul Saffo.
</p><p>The speaker series is in keeping with Cal State Monterey Bay’s role as a community resource, providing forums for provocative discussions that can impact thought and action on issues important to our community.
</p><p>Rheann Fall, outside hitter on CSUMB's volleyball team,  is the first Otter athlete to earn All-American honors in any sport.
</p><p>Fall was selected to the Daktronics All-American first team on Dec. 2.
</p><p>"Cal State Monterey Bay is very proud of Rheann,” said Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.  “Her work in the classroom and on the court is impressive and we want to thank Daktronics for recognizing this and awarding Rheann this wonderful honor. She has earned it. She is a wonderful teammate and helped lead the team to record heights this year.”
</p><p>It was the second national honor to come her way recently. Earlier in the week, she was named to the the American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American honorable mention team. That's in addition to  her selection to the All-California Collegiate Athletic Association first team.
</p><p>Fall was the CCAA’s leader in kills and finished the season seventh in the nation in points and kills. She recorded 16 double-doubles (kills-digs) and had 20 or more kills 11 times. She also had two matches of 20 or more digs this season.
</p><p>She was named a Sport Import/AVCA National Player of the Week and CCAA Player of the Week after leading CSUMB to two victories over nationally ranked teams.
</p><p>“Coach Garry's approach over the last three years has been consistent and this year has paid off, for Rheann and the team,” Otoupal said.
</p><p>“CSUMB volleyball set records this year. I'm honored to have Rheann as a member of Otter athletics; she is one of those student-athletes who make people around her better."
</p><p>Three decades after the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia, echoes from the Vietnam War still reverberate in 21st-century America. A recently published book edited by Dr. David Anderson, professor of history at CSUMB, offers new perspectives on the political, historical, military and social issues that defined the war and its effects on the U.S. and Vietnam. “The Columbia History of the Vietnam War” opens with an introduction by Dr. Anderson on the war’s major moments and enduring relevance.
</p><p>In it he says, “The history of the American war in Vietnam is not a remote academic subject. It is, or it should be, a continuing and real part of policymaking and public discourse on the role of American power and ideals throughout the world.”
</p><p>Dr. Anderson has published a number of books on the Vietnam War. He is a past president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, and is an Army veteran of Vietnam.
</p><p>Publication of the book followed his participation in an international conference in Washington, D.C., in the fall. He was invited to participate in “The American Experience in Southeast Asia, 1946-1975” by the Bureau of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the Department of State. He participated in a session on the U.S. war debate, “Ours to Reason Why: Intervention in Vietnam, Reaction in America.”
</p><p>Cal State Monterey Bay’s teacher education program has received a federal grant to help students obtain a special education credential. Over the course of four years, the U.S. Department of Education grant will provide $1.1 million to provide scholarships for people who want to prepare for a career teaching students with disabilities in the Monterey Bay area. The grant will provide scholarships that can be used to cover tuition, fees, textbooks and laptop computers for credential candidates. Grant money will also be used to develop computer technology that will allow students to access course content online, and use video conferencing for field supervision. Candidates will complete the program equipped to teach students with moderate to severe disabilities including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance. Credential candidates will gain field experiences in the tri-county region as well as in high-need schools. “This grant will address the critical shortage of credentialed special educators in the local area,” said Dr. Josh Harrower, associate professor in the special education program.
</p><p>“It’s an opportunity for currently employed teachers who lack a credential to earn one. It’s also an excellent opportunity for those with a general education credential who are out of work due to the budget situation to go into special ed,” Dr. Harrower said.
</p><p>The grant will support a total of 40 students and is renewable for as long as a student needs to complete his/her credential. The program is designed to be completed in two years.
</p><p>The first group of students will start in summer and fall 2011. Prospective students must apply to the university and the special education program, then they can complete an application for funding.

</p><p>Works by CSUMB student filmmakers will be on display at the Teledramatic Arts Presentation Showcase Dec. 8 in the TAT Studio on Sixth Avenue. The showing is scheduled to run from 7 to 10 p.m.; doors open at 6:30. The presentation is free and the public is invited.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by the Media Arts Club and will include animations, narratives, documentaries and other short films produced this semester by students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program.
</p><p>The TAT building is located adjacent to the World Theater. A campus map and driving directions are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>The Teldramatic Arts and Technology Building will become a giant canvas on Dec. 15 when students project their work onto the building.
</p><p>The videos were created as final projects in Ben Wood’s TAT 421, Motion Graphics class. They include composited and animated graphics, images and sound. The first video will be screened at 5:45 p.m. onto the front façade of the building. The show will last about an hour.
</p><p>The best place for viewing the projections will be directly in front of the building on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>In his own work as a visual artist, Wood has done a number of large-scale public projections. (View a video of his projection onto Coit Tower in San Francisco <a href="http://www.coitlive.com">here</a>.)
</p><p>“The focus is to produce graphics to be integrated with the architecture of the building in order to animate the structure as an alternative form of electronic cinema . . . as a showcase of what is going on within TAT,” Wood said.
</p><p>During the semester, the class has “covered the tools and methodologies to create animated video, graphics and text which may be applied to fields such as special effects, advertising and independent visual projects,” Wood said.
</p><p>The class created this <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/550337">piece earlier </a>in the semester. It’s representative of the work that will be shown on Dec. 15.

</p><p>As last month's election battle over growth on part of Fort Ord showed, the debate over the future of the former Army base is far from over. To look at the various issues from several angles, CSU Monterey Bay and the Fort Ord Reuse Authority are sponsoring a two-day gathering of experts aimed at the public and local decision-makers. – <em>Monterey Herald</em>, Dec. 6, 2013
</p><p>There are gingerbread bakers and gingerbread artists.
</p><p>And then there are gingerbread overachievers.
</p><p>The group representing Focus the Region, the annual teach-in on climate change, fits into the latter category. The faculty and staff members and the single student on the team came up with a “house” they called CandyLEED Campus. Apparently, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) is flexible enough to apply to all building types – gingerbread as well as wood and cement.
</p><p>Their entry earned enough credits to be awarded a platinum rating, using such things as skylights made from salvaged hard candy, melted and cooled into sheets, a garden with drip irrigation, chocolate bar solar panels and a living sweets roof. And they had a LEED®-accredited professional on hand.
</p><p>For their efforts, Team Focus the Region took first place in CSUMB’s seventh annual gingerbread house contest on Dec. 10. They were awarded a tin of butter cookies, a pizza party for 10 (courtesy of Sodexo) and possession of the trophy until next year’s competition.
</p><p>The contest drew nine teams representing several dozen employees. Each group was given a kit consisting of the basic pieces and encouraged to let their imaginations run wild.
</p><p>A panel was invited to judge the entries. Judges included Ken Turgen of Wald, Runke and Dost architects, and chair of the Marina Planning Commission; Julie Ann Lozano of Monterey Bay Office Systems; Charles Wesley of Sodexo catering; and former CSUMB staff member Courtney Kuhn of Quail Lodge.
</p><p>The judges selected the top three finishers. Those who attended the staff and faculty holiday party on Dec. 10 were invited to cast their vote for the People’s Choice Award. The team representing Student Housing and Residential Life took that honor with their model of Chocolate Mountain from the CandyLand board game.
</p><p>All nine entries were displayed in the lobby of the University Center during the party, and then went to local community organizations for display.

</p><p>Artwork by recent CSUMB graduate Jacob Kernodle is gracing the marketing materials for First Night Monterey – the result of a longstanding relationship between the university and the event’s organizers. This year’s theme for the annual event is “Imagine, Create, Participate.” Members of Professor Bobbi Long’s Publications Design course have been designing the poster and button for First Night Monterey since 2003.
</p><p>“These projects give students real-world experience of working with a client and progressing through various stages of the design process,” said Professor Long.
</p><p>Publication Design is not an art class "where students just have a muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you have to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their ideas, and you interpret that," she said.
</p><p>"This program gives students a chance to show their talents, skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a project." Kernodle combined graphic design, business management, marketing and art to earn a degree in integrated studies. After graduation, he returned home to Shingle Springs, a town in the Gold Country near Placerville, where he plans to start an artists’ collaborative to showcase the work of designers and artists. According to its website, First Night Monterey seeks to foster the public's appreciation of visual and performing arts through an innovative, diverse and high-quality program which provides a shared cultural experience accessible and affordable to all. The centerpiece is its alcohol-free celebration on New Year's Eve in downtown Monterey. The First Night concept was created in 1976 by a group of citizens in Boston. It has grown to include celebrations in over 200 cities throughout the U.S. and Canada. First Night Monterey premiered in 1993. The volunteer core has grown from 50 to 500; the audience has grown from 9,000 to 40,000; and participation as a performing or visual artist becomes more competitive each year. First Night Monterey has won awards for promoting the arts, building community, and creating innovative programming. To learn more about the design program at CSUMB, click here.
</p><p>Graduates of the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU Monterey Bay continue to earn recognition and accolades for their work.
</p><p>For the second consecutive year, the university will be represented at the Sundance Film Festival – the biggest independent film gathering in the U.S.
</p><p>“Prairie Love,” produced by 2003 graduate Douglas Mueller, will have its world premiere in the festival’s NEXT competition. Eight films were selected for their innovative and original work on a budget of less than $500,000 – a pittance in the movie industry. Although the NEXT category is non-competitive, an audience choice award is up for grabs.
</p><p>Over 10,000 films – a record number – were submitted to Sundance this year, and just under 200 were accepted, according to the festival website.
</p><p>Sundance will be held in and around Park City, Utah, Jan. 20-30. “Prairie Love” will be screened four times – Jan. 23, 25, 27 and 28 – and Mueller (pictured at left) plans to be on hand for all of them.
</p><p>“The Teledramatic Arts' faculty and staff are ecstatic for Douglas,” said department chair Enid Baxter Blader. “He remains a highly regarded member of our TAT community. This recent accomplishment is a fantastic recognition of his talent and vision."
</p><p>The film was shot in Minot, N.D., in January 2009. It’s a dark comedy about a nomad traveling the rural roads of North Dakota who saves the life of a stranded man. When the nomad discovers the man is headed to visit a pen-pal girlfriend he has never seen, the nomad assumes his identity in hopes of having a relationship with her.
</p><p>The shooting was completed over 23 days, and in sub-zero weather. “On a rare occasion we would do less than 12 hours, and only because we ran out of daylight,” Mueller said. The weather created problems – “cameras fail at about 20 below” – but the filmmakers didn’t let them derail their plans.
</p><p>As the film’s producer, Mueller’s work took a variety of forms.
</p><p>“I focused on the creative end, as opposed to the business or financial elements,” he said. “I gave the director notes on his script from the start, I worked on storyboards, location scouting, casting, costumes, coordinating between the departments, along with making sure whatever we were shooting next was going to be ready.”
</p><p>He was quick to add that his role included a lot of things that weren’t so much fun – cleaning up, shoveling snow, getting cars out of ditches, and “asking for things for free.”
</p><p>After graduating from Minot High School – where he met several of his colleagues on the film – he was determined to go to school in California. He looked for a small school with a good film department. CSUMB filled the bill on both counts.
</p><p>It was a good fit. “There was always a faculty or staff member who was eager to help me with what I needed and ultimately, I walked away with more experience producing and directing than my friends did at New York University,” Mueller said.
</p><p>He believes that the university gave him a “great” education, “not only about film, but many things. My classes and my peers helped me look at social issues in a way I never had. . . .”
</p><p>When he completed his degree in 2003, he stayed in the area. A year later, he joined the Carmel Bach Festival as production manager, a job he still has. His work with the festival inspired him to make “Intermezzo No. 1,” a short documentary about the festival's keyboard tuner that premiered at the Nashville Film Festival this year and will screen at the Ozark Foothills Festival in 2011.
</p><p>"Doug is one of the students who really kept the dream of making movies,” said TAT instructor Steven Levinson. “He was always a great writer and producer. Once he got into the real world, he seriously applied the ‘real world’ training he got here at CSUMB."

</p><p>Last year’s Sundance festival saw the premiere of “Charlie and the Rabbit” by TAT alums Robert Machoian and Rodrigo Ojeda-Beck. “Charlie” and their previous film, “Ella and the Astronaut,” were shown at film festivals around the world.
</p><p>They were named to Filmmaker Magazine’s list of “25 New Faces” for 2010, a list recognizing the top up-and-coming talent in the independent film industry.

</p><p>Paul Meltzer, a Santa Cruz attorney, has donated his 46-foot Hatteras sport fishing yacht to CSU Monterey Bay for use in the university’s marine science program.
</p><p>The boat will be renamed “Harold Heath” in honor of his great-grandfather, a marine scientist who was a Stanford University professor for nearly 40 years and led research at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove. Dr. Heath and his family lived across the street from the Marine Station campus.
</p><p>The vessel will be used by CSUMB’s Seafloor Mapping Lab, where it will support marine research, training and education. It will also be used to support remotely operated vehicles and habitat survey work done by the university's Institute for Applied Marine Ecology.
</p><p>“The Harold Heath will allow us to take the Seafloor Mapping Lab to a new level of performance and service,” said Dr. Rikk Kvitek, a professor in the Division of Science and Environmental Policy and director of the Seafloor Mapping Lab. The lab conducts marine habitat survey work and has been instrumental in the ongoing California Seafloor Mapping Project, an effort to create the first comprehensive, high-resolution map of California's state waters – from the shoreline out three nautical miles. The project involves industry, resource management agencies and universities. Final products will include a series of maps showing the seafloor and coastal geology in unprecedented detail.
</p><p>One of the first uses of the Harold Heath will be to map the last remaining section of state waters, along the southern Big Sur coast. “Because of the remote nature of this part of the coast, the work will require that we spend four or five days at a time at sea,” Dr. Kvitek said. “The Hatteras is very well equipped, in excellent condition and is ideally suited for this work.”
</p><p>It’s that kind of useful research that inspired Mr. Meltzer, an avid deep sea fisherman, to make the gift.
</p><p>“The university is conducting interesting and important marine research that will be immediately useful. This is exactly the kind of research project that would have fascinated my great-grandfather. My father was a commercial fisherman and he would have also been thrilled to see a detailed map of the sea floor,” Mr. Meltzer said.
</p><p>Dr. Heath was involved in coastal marine survey research off the coast of California, Alaska, Mexico, Japan and Brazil. He was one of the first professors at Stanford University, where he joined the Department of Zoology in 1894. He spent most of his scientific life at the Palo Alto campus and at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station. He first taught at the Pacific Grove facility in the summer of 1895. Dr. Heath retired in 1933, but continued his research at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History. He died in 1951. In a memorial tribute, his Stanford colleagues described him as “kindly, quizzical and inspiring.”
</p><p>The Harold Heath will be berthed along the Coast Guard pier in the Monterey harbor. “We will begin outfitting the boat to support seafloor mapping, diving, remotely operated vehicles and video tow-sled surveys right away,” Dr. Kvitek said.

</p><p>Over the course of the season, the Otters have knocked off two teams that were undefeated, beat a team that was nationally ranked at the time, and stunned Division I UC Santa Barbara.
</p><p>In her third year as head coach, Jimenez has transformed a program that won three games the year before she arrived into a unit that’s forcing opponents to take notice.
</p><p>“There was no timetable to turn the program around,” Jimenez said. “But we didn’t want to sit around and wait.”
</p><p>In her first season, the team won 11 games; last year, it set a school record with 18 wins. To read more about the Otters, click <a href="http://otterathletics.com/index.aspx?path=wbball&amp;">here</a>.
</p><p>Young filmmakers eager to see their work on a screen bigger than YouTube will get the opportunity in April, when Cal State Monterey Bay holds its third annual Teen Film Festival.
</p><p>The Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department is accepting applications for the festival, which will be held at CSUMB's World Theater on April 9. Entries can be submitted online at montereybayfilmfestival.com by Feb. 11.
</p><p>Filmmakers between 13 and 19 years old are invited to submit films and videos up to five minutes in length. Entries may be in English or Spanish and there is no entry fee.
</p><p>TAT students will organize the event and handle the judging, according to Professor Enid Baxter Blader.
</p><p>"It's an educational experience for our students, who want to go out in the world and have their films screened in film festivals. A great way to understand that process is to curate a film festival," Blader said.
</p><p>CSUMB also hopes the festival will serve as a way to interest local teens who might not have considered going to college. By inviting them to campus and showing them what the university offers, they may consider enrolling.
</p><p>While local teenagers are encouraged to enter the competition, it's also open to teenagers from around the world.
</p><p>Last year's event drew more than 200 entries; films were submitted from the Central Coast region as well as Great Britain, El Salvador and Armenia. Some of last year's entries can be viewed online at montereybayfilmfestival.com.
</p><p>The teen festival is part of the larger Monterey Bay Film Festival. MBFF will also feature three programs curated by Mike Plante. Mike is an associate programmer of the Sundance Film Festival, and curates many other festivals internationally. This will be Mike's second year as the programmer of the Monterey Bay Film Festival.
</p><p>Focused on independent short films with innovative technologies, the events and web festival introduce Monterey Bay’s unique opportunities for the film industry.

</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay has received a $15,000 grant from Bank of America to support its Small Business Development Center, an innovative program that provides counseling and training to small businesses or people who are trying to start them.
</p><p>“The Bank of America grant allows the Small Business Development Center to maximize the efforts of the whole team,” said Andrea Nield, the center’s associate director.
</p><p>“Small Business Development Centers are America’s best-kept secret for businesses. The Bank of America grant will allow us to strengthen our outreach in order to help more aspiring and existing business owners to achieve their goals,” Nield said. The center, which opened in the fall of 2009, is located in a storefront in Gonzales and has other offices in areas that it serves along the Highway 101 corridor from Gilroy to King City. It provides critical services to small business owners, helping them create jobs and solidify the local economy.
</p><p>The center helps people develop business plans, secure financing, set up bookkeeping systems, improve operations, plan for expansion, project cash flow, determine technology needs and provide a variety of other services helpful to small businesses. In addition to the free one-on-one consulting, the center offers a variety of workshops and seminars.
</p><p>Working in partnership with community leaders, Bank of America's local market leadership directs its giving through local grants that address pressing social, economic, and cultural needs of communities served by the bank. Over the last decade, the bank has supported CSUMB’s Recruitment in Science Education program, the Service Learning Institute and the Green Job Corps program.

</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay has gotten a prominent mention by a blogger for the Huffington Post. Danielle Wiener-Bronner, who writes about higher education issues for the website, included the university on a list of nine “Forward-Thinking Colleges."
</p><p>“There are myriad colleges and universities that exhibit what the future of higher education looks like. Some are new and some more established, but all nine of the schools mentioned below are distinctive in some way – and are worth watching in 2011,” the blog’s introduction says.
</p><p>“When Cal State Monterey Bay was founded in 1994, it called itself ‘the 21st campus for the 21st century,’ and has proven to be as forward-thinking as promised. The state college – which encourages students of low socio-economic backgrounds to enroll and offers around 70 percent of undergrads financial aid – requires each student to conduct a capstone research project and put together a skills portfolio before graduation,” the university’s entry says.
</p><p>Among other schools on the list are Evergreen State College in Washington, Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, Florida A&amp;M and the Global College of Long Island University.
</p><p>To list is available <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/31/9-forwardthinking-schools_n_803008.html#s217483&amp;title=Cal%20State-Monterey%20Bay%20">here.</a>  
</p><h3>Student-industry networking on the agenda at annual conference</h3><p>Students and faculty from CSU Monterey Bay will join colleagues from other California State University campuses to present research on genes, proteins, cancers, crops, water quality and other topics at the 23rd annual CSU Biotechnology Symposium Jan. 7 and 8 at the Hyatt Regency Orange County. Six CSUMB students – four undergraduates and two master’s degree students – will present their work. Dr. Aparna Sreenivasan, who teaches cell and molecular biology, is one of the organizers of the event and helped to select one of this year’s award winners. CSUMB’s Erin Stanfield is a finalist for the annual Eden Graduate Student Research Award, worth $1,750 to cover educational and travel-related expenses. Stanfield’s research uses molecular methods to tackle a problem in the Monterey Bay area – the presence of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria in local lakes. She worked for more than a year at Pinto Lake in Watsonville; her work will help inform water management agencies around the area and garner new information about how these complex organisms sense their environment and produce toxins. Undergraduates Jen Cleveland, Kevin Johnson, Mark Callaghan and Pierre Boivin and grad student Maren Mitch are also presenting their work at the two-day conference. With roughly 500 CSU students and faculty joining nearly 100 industry professionals, community college representatives and elected officials, the symposium is the major annual event dedicated to developing biotechnology researchers in California.
</p><p>The symposium will also feature expert panels of scientists, engineers and journalists addressing healthcare solutions for the developing world, public understanding of human DNA analysis, and the commercialization of life-science innovations. CSU scholars will also discuss innovative research on using databases to discover new drugs, biogeochemistry and cellular physiology, and insulin production in pancreatic cells.
</p><p>Networking sessions for students and workshops for faculty are also on the agenda.
</p><p>It is sponsored by the CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB), which serves as the CSU’s primary liaison to industry and academic partners in the realm.
</p><p>According to CSU Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Academic Officer Ephraim P. Smith, “Each year, the CSU Biotechnology Symposium showcases the research of hundreds of students working toward high-demand science, technology, engineering and math degrees. Biotechnology and other knowledge-based industries represent the future of California's economic growth. CSUPERB's symposium helps to advance well-educated individuals who are critical to this workforce.”
</p><p>CSUPERB Executive Director Susan Baxter said the interface with industry speakers and expert panelists allows faculty-student teams to “stay connected to the grand challenges.”
</p><p>Said Baxter: “They can see how discoveries they’ve made in the laboratory might lead to a new vaccines for childhood diseases or how applied projects might lead to improvements in bioenergy production,” Baxter said. “For many of the students, the symposium marks their first research presentation to the broader scientific community. That’s a major milestone – somewhere between their first science fair and a job as a scientist or engineer or a future PhD.”
</p><p>According to the National Science Foundation, from 1997 to 2006, roughly 7,000 individuals with a bachelor's degree from CSU campuses went on to receive research-based doctoral degrees. (With the exception of recently announced nursing doctorates, the CSU itself does not award doctoral degrees in science.)

</p><p>A San Francisco art exhibit that invites spectators to take part by “dressing to transgress” features the work of CSU Monterey Bay faculty members.
</p><p>“<a href="http://www.somarts.org/glamorgeddonopens/">Glamorgeddon: The Spectacle</a>,” curated by Visual and Public Art Department professors Johanna Poethig, Dio Mendoza and Angelica Muro, is on display through Feb. 4 at the SOMArts Cultural Center.
</p><p>In Poethig’s words, the exhibit “celebrates how we choose to be fabulous, even as we critique the excesses of our own endangered species.”
</p><p>Poethig, a well&#45;known muralist and performance artist, has always been interested in the trappings of culture, media and advertising. “It was important for me to look more critically at product&#45;oriented culture and the ways media and the marketplace have placed a huge burden on us, especially women, to look and act a certain way,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle.
</p><p>Her own contribution to the show includes a series of bedazzled hard hats, which are available for spectators to pose with.
</p><p>The show features the work of more than 20 artists, including Dr. Amalia Mesa&#45;Bains, professor emerita at CSUMB and former chair of the Visual and Public Art Department. All works explore the concept of “glamour” via visual art, mixed media and performance.
</p><p>A series of <a href="http://www.somarts.org/limolectures/">30&#45;minute lectures</a> with some of the artists and scholars will be held on Jan. 30 – in a hot pink limousine.
</p><p>The <a href="http://www.somarts.org">SOMArts Cultural Center</a> is located at 934 Brannan St., between Eighth and Ninth streets, in San Francisco. The exhibit will close on Feb. 4.  Alumni John Elliott, Stephanie Sumler, Rachell Hester and Matt Florianni helped with the exhibit.

</p><p>It was about an 80-minute walk for Jose Hernandez from his home to his middle school in the village near San Luis Potosi, Mexico. . . . Hernandez traveled more than 1,800 miles from his hometown to Salinas, but even further on his educational road. He was named the Hearst Scholar at CSUMB, one of the top honors for students in the CSU system. – <em>Monterey Herald,</em> Oct. 9, 2012
</p><h3>Glass, Plastic, Paper, Oh My</h3><p>Glass, plastic containers, paper and aluminum cans – they all have their place at CSU Monterey Bay. And it’s not in trash cans.
</p><p>Campus recycling efforts got a big boost in the fall of 2009, when each room in the residence halls and all East Campus apartments were equipped with bright blue recycling bins – 3,100 in all. That’s about the time the university’s custodial contract was updated to include emptying of employees’ desk-side recycling bins.
</p><p>This year, CSUMB is measuring itself against other universities when it comes to recycling. As part of a commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, the university is making its first competitive appearance in the annual RecycleMania competition. (It participated last year, but in the non-competitive benchmark division.)
</p><p>RecycleMania is a nationwide, friendly student-led competition that pits colleges and universities in a contest to see which can reduce, reuse and recycle the most campus waste. It offers bragging rights and special awards made out of recycled materials to the winning schools.
</p><p>During last year’s 10-week competition, more than 600 campuses collectively recycled or composted over 84.5 million pounds. The 2011 installment officially runs for eight weeks between Feb. 6 and April 2. Leading up to the main event, colleges participated in two weeks of non-binding “trials” that began Jan. 24.
</p><p>This year, 630 schools – representing six million students – are registered, 391 in the competitive division, 239 in the benchmark division.
</p><p>Throughout the 10 weeks, CSUMB will report its recycling and trash weights and be ranked on RecycleMania’s results page. With each week’s reports and rankings, CSUMB can watch how its program stacks up against its competitors. As results fluctuate, the campus community will make a concerted effort to reduce and recycle even more. The first results should be posted on Feb. 18.
</p><p>"Our goal is to spread more awareness of recycling, to build our own campus recycling program and to reduce our carbon footprint," said Associated Students Environmental Affairs Senator Duane Lindsay.
</p><p>"We want to prove that we truly are a sustainable campus."
</p><p>The Environmental Affairs committee has established a group called the Green Team that will handle the recycling efforts and tabulate the weekly results. The Green Team also plans to work to make campus events such as homecoming and commencement zero waste. And it intends to hold random “awareness walks” around campus, where students spotted recycling – “caught green-handed” – will be given prizes.
</p><p>For more information, visit the RecycleMania website or CSUMB's <a href="http://ideals.csumb.edu/news/students-work-make-university-green">webpage</a>. To view the weekly results compiled by residence hall, check the display cases in front of the Otter Express.  
</p><h2>Convenience, savings with free rides</h2><h4>CSUMB username serves as transit pass on all MST routes</h4><p>It’s really a free ride.
</p><p>Starting Jan. 15, Cal State Monterey Bay students enrolled in the spring semester, as well as faculty and staff members, will be able to ride all Monterey-Salinas Transit buses for free.
</p><p>The UPASS program makes taking the bus more convenient than ever. No more fumbling for exact change – Otter identification card holders can just flash their IDs to the bus driver and take a seat.
</p><p>Using the free service to get around can eliminate the costs of driving a car – gas, insurance, parking fee and tickets, vehicle maintenance – for an annual savings of $9,600, according to a national survey released this month by the American Public Transportation Association.
</p><p>In addition to the convenience and money savings, using public transit spares the air from unhealthy pollutants. And if the closest transit stop is a bit far to walk, people can consider rolling there on a bike, skateboard or roller stakes.
</p><p>MST lines 16 and 25 (the Otter Trolley) stop at 24 locations on main and east campus. Both lines go through campus every hour in each direction, and can be used for on-campus shuttling as well as to reach destinations in Seaside, Marina and Salinas. Until now, riders were able to board on campus for free, but had to pay the return fare.
</p><p>Now, CSUMB username card holders can use those routes, as well as take the bus to Big Sur, Carmel, South Monterey County, and as far north as San Jose – all for free.
</p><p>The 2011 MST Rider’s Guide contains maps and schedules for all routes and is available at the Student Center, in Suite A of Mountain Hall, and online at <a href="http://www.mst.org" title="www.mst.org">www.mst.org</a> and csumb.edu/trip.
</p><p>Fifty-three students from Rolling Hills Middle School in Watsonville voluntarily spent their last week of winter break studying algebra – and having fun.
</p><p>The Algebra Academy was held at the headquarters of Graniterock in Watsonville from Jan. 3 through 6. On Friday of that week, the youngsters spent the day on the campus of California State University, Monterey Bay, then returned to Graniterock for a graduation ceremony on Saturday, where they received certificates.
</p><p>CSUMB math professors Hongde Hu and Lorraine O’Shea, assisted by four university students, taught the classes.
</p><p>Dr. Hu said he designed the program to get students up to speed with standards recently adopted by the California Department of Education that mandate preparation in algebra.
</p><p>“The academy is also intended to build a strong math foundation through hands-on activities with algebra applications in the real world,” he added.
</p><p>Among the problems they worked on: figuring out the odds of winning the state lottery and determining why California license plates need three letters.
</p><p>At CSUMB on Friday, the middle school students spent time in a math classroom where they played a game called “Survivor: Math Camp” that called on the skills they learned earlier in the week. One of the problems –10-5 (2-3) = ? – stumped all but three of them. The answer: 15.
</p><p>They also got a tour of campus, had lunch in the dining hall and learned what they have to do to prepare for college.
</p><p>Rollling Hills principal Rick Ito appreciated the opportunity for his students to participate in the program.
</p><p>“I think the important thing is that students have seen math in a different way. They have seen how math can affect very aspect of their lives,” he said. “It’s not just in a classroom. It’s all around us.”
</p><p>Ito also complimented the work of the four CSUMB students.
</p><p>“The teaching assistants have really made a connection with the students. They’re a bridge between the professors and the youngsters.
</p><p>“The CSUMB students have done a great job.”
</p><p>Graniterock CEO Bruce Woolpert and assistant general counsel Kevin Jeffery spearheaded the academy. The company has worked with Rolling Hills for four years, sending tutors from the company to help with English, art, math and science as well as hosting events such as awards ceremonies for students who get good grades.
</p><p>The students worked with tablet PCs provided by HP as part of a grant it recently awarded the university. CSUMB’s “Leapfrogging Mathematics in the Early Start Program” was one of only 10 applications that earned an EdTech Innovators Award from HP and the New Media Consortium. The award recognizes pioneers in education who are using technology in groundbreaking ways.
</p><p>According to HP, “Leapfrogging Math” stood out because it’s a proven example of an educational project that uses technology in novel ways inside and outside the classroom.
</p><p>The program’s goals are to reduce the percentage of college freshmen who need remedial math from 60 to under 40 percent; to help high school teachers invigorate their courses and collaborate with college professors on curriculum; and to document the work so that it can be used on campuses across the country.
</p><p>Working with HP, the university has created a remedial math program that serves about 500 of its own freshmen each year. More than 92 percent of students are passing the two-semester course, compared to the national rate of just under 50 percent.

</p><h4>CSUMB wins HP award
	Math program selected as one of 10 exemplary projects worldwide</h4><p>Cal State Monterey Bay has earned an EdTech Innovators Award from Hewlett Packard and the New Media Consortium. The award recognizes pioneers in education who are using technology in groundbreaking ways.
</p><p>According to HP, CSUMB’s project, “Leapfrogging Mathematics in the Early Start Program,” stood out because it’s a proven example of an educational project that uses technology in novel ways inside and outside the classroom. The EdTech Innovators Award includes a technology grant of $40,000 and membership in a social network designed for educators. Only 10 winners were selected – 4 percent of applications – representing educational institutions in the U.S., India, Costa Rica, South Africa, Canada and Brazil. The new grant allows high school math teachers and students to attend four weeks of math “boot camp” during the summer. The high school teachers will partner with CSUMB faculty members on new educational strategies using tablet PCs – personal computers equipped with touch screens – that address the needs of remedial math students. The project’s goals are to reduce the percentage of college freshmen who need remedial math from 60 percent to under 40 percent; to help high school teachers invigorate their courses and collaborate with college professors on curriculum; and to document the work so that it can be used on campuses across the country. Leapfrogging Math is a new program, but it builds on CSUMB’s successes in courses using tablet PC technology. Working with HP, the university has created a remedial math program that serves about 500 of its own freshmen each year. More than 92 percent of students are passing the two-semester course, compared to the national rate of just under 50 percent. In recognition of the university’s innovative work to integrate mobile technologies across the curriculum, HP has awarded four technology grants to CSUMB’s Wireless Education and Technology Center since 2003.  
</p><p><em>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne Harrison sent this message to the campus community on Tuesday, Jan. 11:</em>
</p><p>In his proposed 2011-2012 state budget, introduced on Monday, Gov. Jerry Brown asks the Legislature to cut $500 million from the CSU’s system-wide budget and an equal amount from the University of California system, as well as $400 million from community colleges. That is $1.4 billion less for higher education, out of a total $12.4 billion in spending cuts recommended by the governor. He proposes no new cuts in K-12 education. The CSU faces an 18 percent loss in state funding, taking the system back to 1999-2000 levels, even though it now serves nearly 70,000 more students. This would undo progress the CSU made this fiscal year in restoring funding lost in the previous two years. Even worse, the $500 million is a “best-case” scenario that hinges on voter approval this spring to extend temporary tax increases. Our staff, faculty, students, parents, and many community friends are understandably anxious to know what this will specifically mean for California State University, Monterey Bay. It is still too early to say, though I pledge to keep all of our stakeholders as informed as possible in the months ahead. I should have a better idea how the proposed budget would affect our campus by late January or early February. We will need everyone’s support and understanding as we make tough decisions. Clearly, we will have to manage our way through a very difficult period that could easily extend beyond next year. Having tightened our belt through several budget cycles, we are already about as lean and efficient as we can get. We have left positions vacant, slashed spending on repairs, maintenance and equipment, restricted travel, and streamlined departments. I and my campus colleagues will do all we can to preserve and protect instruction and support services to our students. Gov. Brown’s budget proposal will not affect enrollment this spring, but the CSU, including Monterey Bay, will likely admit fewer students for Fall 2011. In terms of financial aid, students who are receiving Pell Grants should not experience any change, and we do not anticipate any rollback in state university grants. With regard to other steps necessary to achieve the needed reductions in spending, everything remains on the table. I will be meeting with our Senior Leadership Team to develop alternatives that prepare us for whatever emerges in the final state budget and CSU plan. We will keep the best interests of our students and the entire university in mind as we weigh our options. Sincerely, Dianne F. Harrison, Ph.D. President  
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s Master of Social Work program is accepting applications for Fall 2011. Application deadline is Jan. 31
</p><p>The program provides an opportunity for people who are interested in a career in social work, or who want to advance in their career, to earn an MSW degree in a way that is both accessible and affordable. It is intended to address a chronic shortage of professionally trained social workers in the tri-county area, especially those who are bilingual and bicultural.
</p><p>Classes are small and personal, and are offered in the evenings. The three-year program allows students to concentrate in either Behavioral Health, or Children, Youth and Families. Students must also complete an internship of 1,000 hours total, 250 hours per semester starting in the second year.
</p><p>For more information, contact Vivienne Orgel at 582-5315. Admission requirements and application materials are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/msw">here</a>.
</p><p>An information session to learn more about the program is scheduled for Jan. 20, noon to 1 p.m. in Beach Hall. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
</p><p>Last fall's inaugural class numbered 41 students. Ninety-five percent of them come from Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties; 10 percent are employed by one of those counties; most are female; and 40 percent are bilingual.  Nearly 70 percent earned a bachelor's degree in the last five years and nearly 60 percent are under the age of 30.

</p><p>In a large conference room at Graniterock's headquarters in Watsonville, 54 Rolling Hills Middle School students are voluntarily spending a week of their winter break studying algebra and to the casual observer, they're having fun. Taught by a team of mathematics professors and students from CSUMB, the Algebra Academy give the students six hours per day of math instruction in what organizers hope is a relaxed atmosphere without the threat of quizzes looming over their heads.  — <em>Watsonville Register-Pajaronian</em>, Jan. 6, 2011
</p><p>Renee Jimenez didn't actively recruit the best players in teh off-season. Instead she went after players that played on the best teams. "I hate to lose," said the CSUMB women's coach. "These kids come from prgrams that are accustomed to winning." And it shows. While gaining nationwide respect has been slow, the Otter's record-breaking start continues after rolling to a 71-41 win Friday over visiting Cal State, Los Angeles. -The Herald, Jan. 8, 2011
</p><p>If money is a problem for prospective students seeking a special education teaching credential n the local university, government money can be the answer. CSUMB's teacher education program received a federal grant to help students prepare for a career teaching students with disabilities.   -The Californian, Jan. 12, 2011

</p><p>To most sports teams, a new year falls somewhere between rebuilding and reloading. For the baseball team at Cal State Monterey Bay, it is a matter of reinventing. First-year coach Walt White has began his time in Seaside with hopes to make the Otters a force in the CCAA. — <em>Salinas Californian</em>, Jan. 17, 2011
</p><h3>Watch the Otters online</h3><p>The Internet has sparked an evolution in college sports viewing, and CSUMB has picked up on the trend.
</p><p>Colleges and universities nationwide are increasingly video-streaming their sporting events on their websites. It’s a way to broaden fan support for schools whose games are not televised and make games available to family and alumni living outside the region.
</p><p>At CSUMB, all home basketball and volleyball games are broadcast online. To find the broadcast, visit otherathletics.com and click on the “live audio/video/stats” tab on the right-hand side.
</p><p>While soccer, baseball and softball games are not broadcast, live, play-by-play statistics are available online at the same web address.
</p><p>It’s also possible to follow the Otters on the road. Live stats of men’s and women’s basketball and volleyball games have been mandated by the California Collegiate Athletic Association and are available via the CCAA Network at <a href="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx" title="http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx">http://goccaa.org/sports/2009/8/26/ccaanetwork.aspx</a>.
</p><p>In addition, some schools – such as Sonoma State, Cal State Stanislaus and Cal State L.A. – provide video streaming of their home games. Broadcasts can be accessed via the CCAA Network.
</p><p>The Jan. 28 women’s basketball game at home to Cal Poly Pomona is a good time to check out the streaming video. The Otters lead the CCAA with a 12-0 conference record. Tip-off is 5:30 p.m.
</p><p>Part of what's driving the trend is that the Internet has increasingly become the main communication tool in college athletics.
</p><p>That also creates new opportunity for smaller schools.
</p><p>"We don't get the media exposure that the Division I schools get. We're not on TV. This is our opportunity to get our exposure and develop our fan base," said Mindy Mills, CSUMB’s sports information director. "This helps us get more exposure outside the boundaries of our campus."
</p><p>For those who prefer more traditional media, all Otter men's basketball games – home and away – are broadcast on KION 1460 AM in the Monterey Bay area.  
</p><h3>Open house scheduled for Jan. 27 at CSUMB</h3><p>California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to learn more about the master’s degree program in Instructional Science and Technology at an open house on Jan. 27.
</p><p>The event will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center on Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard. Several current students and graduates of the program will share their experience and how they are applying the skills they acquired to their current work.
</p><p>The 16-month program will start in August. Application deadline is March 15.
</p><p>The Master’s in Instructional Science and Technology program prepares students for positions in the fast-changing fields of modern education and training. The hybrid learning experience – which integrates several days on campus at the beginning of each semester with online classes – enables graduates to advance in their current careers and will position them to assume leadership roles in education and training.
</p><p>Successful educators and e-learning developers in the knowledge-based, global economy require command of all the technological tools and methodologies available to them; the MIST program is designed to provide students with those skills.
</p><p>More information about the MIST program is available at csumb.edu/mist, by calling the School of School of Computing and Design at 582-4741, or by e-mailing <a href="m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;c&#115;&#117;&#109;&#98;&#46;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;">mist@csumb.edu</a>.

</p><h2>Instructor contributes to book from Harvard Press</h2><p>Once in a great while, as The New York Times noted recently, a naturalist writes a book that changes the way people look at the living world. John James Audubon's "Birds of America," published in 1838, was one. Roger Tory Peterson's 1934 "Field Guide to the Birds" was another.
</p><p>Add another title to that list.
</p><p>"Field Notes on Science and Nature," published in 2011 by Harvard University Press, allows readers to peer over the shoulders and into the notebooks of a dozen researchers, to study first-hand their observational methods, materials and fleeting impressions.
</p><p>"Field Notes" offers specific examples that professional naturalists can emulate to fine-tune their own field methods, along with practical advice that amateur naturalists and students can use to document their adventures.
</p><p>Some of that practical advice comes from Jenny Keller, an instructor in the Science Illustration program at CSU Monterey Bay, who contributed a chapter and the cover illustration. Her chapter is titled “Why Sketch?” In it, she encourages scientists to give it a try, and offers some basic drawing instruction. “I’m trying to make the case that it’s doable and here’s how,” she said. “It’s not that hard to add some simple visuals to your field observations, and it will deepen the amount of information your field notes can capture. The drawings will be able to say things that are hard to capture in words. “Careful observation makes you a better scientist, and drawing is a great way to observe,” Keller said. The project started several years ago when the book’s editor, Michael Canfield, contacted Keller out of the blue. “I don’t know how he found me, but we talked animatedly for about 90 minutes, and then we realized that we wanted to work together on the project,” she said. “I’m honored to be in the company of these naturalists. Some of my biggest heroes are contributors to this book,” she said. Keller came to CSUMB when the science illustration program moved to the university from its original home at UC Santa Cruz Extension in the fall of 2009. She teaches field sketching, applied techniques in natural science illustration, zoological illustration and history of scientific illustration. She combined her lifelong interests in art and science when she began keeping illustrated field journals in 1981. Since that time, sketching natural subjects from life has continued to inspire and inform her other illustration projects, which have centered on mammals, birds, and botanical subject matter. Her work has appeared in numerous books, magazine and other publications. In 1992, “Dolphin Days,” a book she illustrated, won the John Burroughs Award for best book of the year in natural history. More information on the science illustration program at CSUMB is available <a href="http://scienceillustration.org">here</a>.

</p><p>To celebrate Black History Month, California State University, Monterey Bay invites the public to a free musical performance by the group Voices of Freedom.
</p><p>The hourlong concert will be held at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 8, in the Music Hall on Sixth Avenue, near the intersection with Butler Street. Driving directions and a campus are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>Oakland-based Voices of Freedom is comprised of members of church choirs, students and faculty at several Bay Area colleges as well as members of the community.
</p><p>The program, “Get Your Shout On,” will include ancient Yoruba chants from West Africa, and will demonstrate how Negro spirituals derived from those chants. The program will end with a re-creation of a ring-shout, a feature of the “invisible” church of enslaved Africans and their American-born descendants. Singing, dancing and percussion are involved; the audience will be invited to participate.
</p><p>The choir is accompanied by a battery of batá (sacred) drums, led by master drummer Otobaji Stewart. Voices of Freedom’s founder and executive director Wanda Ravernell – a former editor and writer at the San Francisco Chronicle – will provide historical and spiritual context for the music.

The studies – which represent 20 campuses and the CSU’s Moss Landing Marine Laboratory – focus on topics that include invasive species, unseen internal waves, sustainable seafood, marine-protection areas, environmental contaminants, ocean acidification, gene-tracking in the sea, and ripple patterns in submerged sand.
</p><p>CSUMB undergraduates Alexandra Davis, Craig Mueller, Todd Hallenbeck, Julia Carrillo and Jocelyne Gomez worked with faculty mentor Rikk Kvitek. The abstract for their project describes it this way:
</p><p>"The California Seafloor Mapping Project (CSMP) is a cooperative initiative creating a comprehensive, high-resolution coastal/marine geologic and habitat base map for all of California’s state waters. This 8500 km2 dataset is enabling researchers to study patterns and distribution of near-shore habitats at scales never before possible, including the presence of rippled scour depressions (RSD) as the most prominent feature on the continental shelf . . . . The goal is to use autoclassification methods to quantify the extent and distribution of three benthic habitats (rock, sediment, RSD) within state waters . . . results are used to quantify and characterize patterns in the distribution and abundance of these habitats along the California continental margin."
</p><p>The purpose of the event is to provide a measure of the excellence and relevance of marine and coastal research conducted within the CSU system. For more about COAST, visit <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/coast" title="www.calstate.edu/coast">www.calstate.edu/coast</a>.

</p><p>A pair of CSUMB undergraduates and four students from Seaside High School have teamed up on a project they hope will help to clean up the local environment.
</p><p>A 10-minute documentary-style film, “Litter: A Community Problem That Needs Community Solutions,” is the result of their collaboration.
</p><p>It was shown at an event in Salinas on Jan. 26, sponsored by Sustainable Monterey County.
</p><p>Stephen Richmond and Stefanie Kortman got involved with the project as a way to satisfy the requirements of Professor Suzie Worcester’s Interpreting Monterey Bay Natural History service learning class. The two selected litter as the topic they wanted to pursue after hearing a presentation by a local environmental educator.
</p><p>Because Professor Worcester’s classes had worked with Seaside High in the past, they approached biology teacher Julie Haws. She was eager to have her students participate. As a result, Jasmine Spears, Dania Blanco, Susan Le and Alondra Ortiz worked with Richmond and Kortman, narrating the film and setting its direction.
</p><p>The film focuses on litter issues in Marina and includes interviews with local leaders and community residents to demonstrate how it affects the environment. The student team filmed areas of the city where litter is a real problem, making sure to clean it up before moving on to the next location.
</p><p>Haws said the opportunity for her students to participate in the project is beneficial in several ways.
</p><p>“It’s amazing that these college students, who aren’t much older than my students, are mentoring them and encouraging them to go to college,” Haws told the Monterey Herald. “It also helps my students connect with a sense of place, and the problems we have that affect us not just here but globally.”  
</p><p>Kevin Johnson took a top honor at the inaugural Emerging Researchers National Conference in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, held Feb. 24 and 25 in Washington, D.C.
</p><p>A biology major, Johnson won first place in the Ecology, Environmental and Earth Sciences division for his poster presentation.
</p><p>He summarized research he started last summer, when he worked with graduate student Erin Stanfield. The project began as an internship with the Santa Cruz Water Department, a position that was arranged through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center at CSU Monterey Bay and funded by the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.
</p><p>His research involves observing what types of cyanobacteria – a blue-green algae – are present in Loch Lomond and Pinto Lake, and whether or not they have the potential to produce microcystin, a liver toxin that has been linked to sea otter deaths in Monterey Bay. The World Health Organization has set limits on the amount of microcystin in sources of recreational and drinking water.
</p><p>“We are looking at Pinto Lake in Watsonville because it’s a recreational body of water that has produced large blooms of cyanobacteria. And we’re looking at Loch Lomond because it’s the source of drinking water for Santa Cruz,” Johnson said. “We’re using both environmental and molecular lab techniques in order to identify potential toxicity at each lake.
</p><p>“This research will inform water management agencies in Watsonville and Santa Cruz regarding water quality,” Johnson said.
</p><p>The conference was designed to help students enhance their science communication skills, better understand how to prepare for science careers in a global workforce, and to find out about summer, graduate school, and employment opportunities. It was co-sponsored by American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Science Foundation and aimed at students who participate in programs funded by the NSF. His travel expenses, registration fees and hotel were covered by the AAAS.
</p><p>"This is a great example of how research mentoring can propel our students to academic and research excellence," said Dr. Bill Head, director of UROC. 
</p><p>The junior from San Benito County has had experience talking about his work. He was selected to attend the CSU Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) conference in early January, where he also made a poster presentation.

</p><h3>Kim Weston kicks off Visiting Artist series</h3><p>Kim Weston, artist and grandson of photographer Edward Weston, will kick off the spring visiting artists lecture series at CSU Monterey Bay on February 17, 2011.
</p><p>The event will be held in the University Center living room starting with a reception at 6 p.m. The talk will follow at 6:30. The public is invited to attend this free event.
</p><p>“Growing Up Weston” is the title of his illustrated lecture. Kim’s talk will reveal insights into three generations of one of the most important and creative families in photography.
</p><p>He learned his craft assisting his father Cole in the darkroom, making gallery prints from his grandfather Edward's original negatives. Kim also worked for many years as an assistant to his uncle Brett, whose bold, abstract photographs rank as some of the finest examples of modern photographic art.
</p><p>Together, the Westons’ work has made the Monterey Peninsula an important locale in American visual culture, like Ansel Adams’ Yosemite or Georgia O’Keefe’s New Mexico.
</p><p>While being trained by his father, Kim learned that the reward was in the process of the prints, not just in the final image.
</p><p>Reminiscing about the days when he was an assistant to his uncle, Kim said, “My uncle used to say a great thing. When he would show his work, people would ask him to interpret it, and he would simply say, ‘The photograph speaks for itself.’ That is all he would ever say of his art.”
</p><p>Kim has been a fine art photographer for 30 years, specializing in large format photography. His main body of work consists of silver contact prints made from 8x10 negatives. He also photographs with a Mamiya 67 that he inherited from his father. Lately, he has added paint to his photographs.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>Other artists scheduled to visit this semester are printmakers Imin Yeh on March 3 and Nancy Hom on April 7, 2011.

</p><h3>Feb. 22 talk marks eating disorders awareness week</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay will mark National Eating Disorders Awareness Week with a presentation by author, speaker and yoga therapist Brie Mathers. The free event will take place at 7 p.m., Feb. 22, in the University Center living room. The public is invited. Mathers’ topic is “Love the Skin You’re In – Taking out the Social Programming that Rules our Self-Images and Pocketbooks.” She’ll share the story of her near-miss Olympic dream due to anorexia and her healing, which inspired a passionate speaking campaign and online recovery program. After the presentation, Mathers (pictured at left) will be available for questions and will sign copies of her book, “Freedom to Blossom – An Invitation to Shine.” The National Eating Disorders Association has proclaimed Feb. 20-26 as the 24th annual week set aside to talk about eating disorders and unrealistic body-perfect ideals, and to fight for more research, support and access to treatment for people suffering from these life-threatening illnesses. Through NED Awareness Week, the national non-profit group seeks to educate the public on signs and symptoms of eating disorders and encourage people to get help. The goal is also to spread a message of hope: Help is available, recovery is possible and those affected are not alone in their struggle. According to the group’s website, <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:">www.nationaleatingdisorders.org:</a> • Nearly 10 million females and 1 million males in the U.S. are battling eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, while millions more suffer from binge eating disorder.
</p><p>• The peak onset of eating disorders occurs during puberty and the late teen/early adult years, but symptoms can occur as young as kindergarten.
</p><p>• More than one in three normal dieters progresses to pathological dieting.
</p><p>CSUMB’s Personal Growth and Counseling Center is sponsoring the event in collaboration with the office of Student Activities and Leadership Development, Student Housing and Residential Life, and the athletic department. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.

</p><h2>Renowned school reformer Diane Ravitch has changed her mind</h2><h3>Federal testing has narrowed education and charter schools have failed to live up to their promise, she says</h3><p>The President’s Speaker Series at CSU Monterey Bay resumes Feb. 23 when prominent education scholar Diane Ravitch visits campus. Her talk will start at 7 p.m. in the World Theater on Sixth Avenue.
</p><p>Her topic: Will Education Reform Improve Our Schools? She will use her best-selling book, The Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education, as the foundation for a discussion on the critical state of education reform in our nation.
</p><p>Dr. Ravitch is research professor of education at New York University; a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. From 1991 through 1993, she was assistant secretary of education in the administration of President George H.W. Bush, where she led the federal effort to promote the creation of state and national academic standards.
</p><p>A former proponent of the No Child Left Behind Act, Dr. Ravitch later became disillusioned by the test score-based philosophy and has become one of its most vocal critics. “We are judging students by these test scores. They are not telling us how much students are learning. They are telling us how much students have been prepped,” Ravitch has said. In the book, she critiques the punitive uses of accountability to fire teachers and close schools, as well as replacing public schools with charter schools and relying on superstar teachers.
</p><p>“We should have a long-term plan in which we improve the quality of the teaching force, have higher educational expectations for those who come into teaching. We should begin to think about an improved profession, better assessments and insisting on this vision of education in which kids get a broad, rich and coherent curriculum, rather than basic skills only,” she said in her latest book.
</p><p>Dr. Ravitch shares a blog called Bridging Differences with Deborah Meier, hosted by Education Week. She also blogs for politico.com/arena and the Huffington Post. Her articles have appeared in many newspapers and magazines.
</p><p>The lecture is free. Reservations are recommended and can be made online by clicking <a href="http://rsvp.csumb.edu/index.php?eid=70">here</a>. For more information, or to request disability accommodations, call (831) 582-4580.

</p><h3>A scuba beauty pageant?</h3><p>“Saltwater runs through my veins,” said Chanel Hason, a 2010 graduate of the <a href="http://catalog.csumb.edu/undergrad-education/majors/environmental-science-technology-policy">Environmental Science, Technology and Policy</a> program.
</p><p>That’s why the idea of vying for the title of Miss Scuba International 2013 – a competition devoted to protecting the oceans – appeals to her. She will represent the United States in the pageant on Dec. 20 in Malaysia.
</p><p>You’ve never heard of the competition? That may be because it’s only two years old and was founded by the owner of several diving resorts in Malaysia.
</p><p>“It’s huge in the Asian countries,” Hason said, “but hasn’t picked up speed yet in the U.S.”
</p><p>She doesn’t see herself as a typical beauty queen. Instead, she said, “I’m a marine conservationist, scuba diver, educator and environmentalist, and I’m ready to win the Miss Scuba International Pageant!”
</p><p>Hason said the contestants are judged on talent. She’s showcasing her skills as a photographer “to get people excited about how beautiful our planet is, not only above water but below the water as well.”
</p><p>Contestants will also be judged on their diving skills, knowledge of scuba tourism and marine conservation, communications, work ethic, and proficiency in a question-and-answer session.
</p><p>“We’ll be tested on how we assemble our gear, and given a list of skills to demonstrate underwater,” she said. That shouldn’t present a problem for Hason, who has been a certified diver since 2006, and earned advanced and rescue certifications while at CSUMB.
</p><p>The 25-year-old resident of Los Angeles said her love of the ocean began on a trip to Sea World when she was 5. Her interest in marine science brought her to CSUMB; while a student, she spent three years as a volunteer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and studied in Australia for a year, conducting research on the Great Barrier Reef.
</p><p>She’ll be in Malaysia for two weeks, scuba diving and participating in conservation efforts that include releasing baby sea turtles and cleaning beaches.
</p><p>The pageant winner, according to the Miss Scuba website, “will undertake a year of ocean conservation campaigns to educate and inspire the desire in all of us to do our best to safeguard our oceans. The pageant will also offer her a unique and comprehensive platform to launch her career and personal development.”
</p><p>Hason embraces the idea and hopes this will lead to her dream job somewhere in the ecotourism industry.
</p><p>“I love interacting with people and being outdoors,” she said. “I belong on a beach in a wetsuit, not behind a desk.
</p><p>“My purpose in life is to educate as many people as possible about ways to protect our planet, and this opportunity with the pageant seemed like a step in the right direction,” she said.
