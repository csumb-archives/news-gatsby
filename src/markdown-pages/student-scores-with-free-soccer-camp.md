<p>A service-learning project of a student at California State University, Monterey Bay has evolved into a regularly scheduled recreational program for Salinas-area children. Rodrigo Reyes needed to complete a 40-hour community project, and, because he grew up in east Salinas, wanted to do something that would affect the community he calls home. â€“ The Salinas Californian, May 30, 2011
