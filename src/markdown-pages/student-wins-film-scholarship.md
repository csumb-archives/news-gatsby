<h3>Monterey County Film Commission makes award</h3><p>Dominic Parisi is this year’s recipient of the $1,000 prize in the Monterey County Film Commission’s Film Student Scholarship and Awards Program.
</p><p>Parisi, who will be a senior in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department, is from Glendora. He plans to use the grant to help with expenses for his capstone film, a documentary that looks at women who participate in roller derby.
</p><p>“Dominic intends to explore the complicated relationship between this women’s sport and feminist ideas,” said Caitlin Manning, a professor in the TAT Department.
</p><p>“Roller derby participants often conform to social norms that are oppressive to women, but many find the sport empowering to them as women,” Manning said. “This won’t be a puff piece on a trendy new sport. Dominic is getting at serious and interesting social issues in this documentary.”
</p><p>The award “really takes a big load off my shoulders,” Parisi said. “It’ll cover some production costs and allow me to purchase a camera that will enable more creative shots.”
</p><p>Manning described the aspiring film editor as “a teacher’s dream.”
</p><p>“He plugs away at his work quietly, comes for help when he needs it, and responds well to feedback,” she said. The Monterey County Film Commission scholarship program was created to provide financial aid and incentive to students of film and beginning filmmakers who reside in Monterey County or are enrolled in a college or university in the county. The fund was established as a permanent endowment with the Community Foundation for Monterey County. Film commission board member Jeff Clark is the scholarship program chair. The scholarship was created in 2008 and has gone to CSUMB students each year. Estee Blancher and Veronica Calvillo shared the inaugural award. In 2009, Juan Ramirez – who now works in the TAT Department as a media specialist – was the winner. Rachel Asendorf received the award in 2010.
