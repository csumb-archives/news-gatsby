<h2>FIRST THINGS LAST 
	So long 2011, hello CSUMB First Night Film Fest</h2><p>First Night Monterey, the community New Year's Eve celebration, will offer the opportunity to catch the work of filmmakers who studied at CSU Monterey Bay's Teledramatic Arts and Technology program.
</p><p>Amid family-friendly art workshops, music – classical to jazz, blues to rock, hip-hop to folk – and the pageantry and puppetry of the Twilight Procession parade, is the CSUMB First Night Film Fest.   Starting at 3:30 p.m. in the Museum of Monterey – formerly the Maritime Museum – nine short films will be screened. They include documentaries, animation and narratives. A lising of the films to be screened can be found <a href="http://www.firstnightmonterey.org/FNM2012/Film.html">here</a>.
</p><p>More than 70 performances are scheduled at 20 venues and locales across the city from 3 p.m. to midnight. Admission buttons are required for all indoor events. Adult prices are $20 in advance and $25 on Dec. 31; youth prices are $12 and $15. Tickets are available at a variety of locations around town and on the First Night website.
</p><p>First Night Monterey, now in its 19th year, is an alcohol-free New Year’s Eve community arts celebration designed for all ages. Musicians, dancers, singers, poets and other artisans transform the streets of the city into a festive setting. FNM is a nonprofit arts organization whose mission is to bring families together and unite the community in all its diversity through the visual and performing arts.
</p><p>A complete schedule is available <a href="http://www.firstnightmonterey.org.">here</a>.
</p><p>The film fest isn't CSUMB's only contribution to First Night.
</p><p>Artwork by senior Raissa Figueroa graces the marketing materials for the event – the result of a longstanding relationship between the university and the event’s organizers. This year’s theme is “A FantaSea of Art."
</p><p>Members of Professor Bobbi Long’s Publications Design course have been designing the poster and button for First Night Monterey since 2003.
</p><p>“These projects give students real-world experience of working with a client and progressing through various stages of the design process,” Professor Long said.
</p><p>Publication Design is not an art class "where students just have a muse. We teach them the actual design process. In design, you have to listen to your client, who tells you their needs and their ideas, and you interpret that," she said.
</p><p>"This program gives students a chance to show their talents, skills, and creativity, but it also teaches them how to listen and respond to what they hear, as well as how to manage a project."
