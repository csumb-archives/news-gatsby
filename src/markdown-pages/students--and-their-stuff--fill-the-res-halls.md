<p>Aug. 19 was move-in day at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The parking lots bustled with incoming students and their parents unloading bags and boxes of clothing, comforters, pillows, electronics and precious keepsakes from home.
</p><p>Many of the 845 freshmen and 550 new transfer students – some of whom were separating from their families for the first time – spent the day moving into residence halls that will be their homes for the next year, meeting their roommates and figuring out how to arrange the furniture.
</p><p>They moved into buildings that were refurbished over the summer, with new paint and carpeting.
</p><p>Throughout the weekend, 1,800 students moved onto main campus. The student body was expected to number about 5,200 when classes started on Aug. 22.
</p><p>Volunteers – students and staff members – were posted around campus to help carry things, give directions and answer questions, telling people where to check in, how to obtain a campus ID card and where to grab lunch.
</p><p>The university scheduled a week’s worth of activities to help the new students get acquainted with each other and connect to the campus. An ice cream social, comedy and music concert, and a late-night DJ in the Student Center got the week rolling on Friday.
</p><p>A complete schedule of Otter Welcome Week activities can be found <a href="http://csumb.edu/search/redirect/11418?searchterm=Otter+Days">here</a>.
