<p>As publicity kicks in for the annual Together with Love 5 and 10K race, colorful posters are popping up around the local area.</p><p>The artwork was done by CSU Monterey Bay student Andrew Bailey in Professor Bobbi Long’s introduction to digital graphic design class.
</p><p>This is the fifth year the Monterey County Rape Crisis Center, sponsor of the annual race that is held near Valentine’s Day, has worked with CSUMB to develop the logo that is used in marketing materials – in print ads, on television, online and on coffee mugs – and on the T&#45;shirts given to the 1,200 race participants.
</p><p>The challenge for students is to come up with a design that combines the “Together with Love” theme, the date of the race and MCRCC’s full name, and that communicates the purpose of the event.

Staff members from the center made several visits to the class to introduce the project, work with the students, and provide feedback.

“We so appreciate Professor Long inviting us to be a part of her class and the work of the students who put together some really great designs,” said Clare Mounteer, Rape Crisis Cente rexecutive director.

“We love this partnership with CSUMB and hope it goes on for many years.”
