<h3>Monterey’s past showcased during weekend event</h3><p>Professor Ruben Mendoza and his archaeology students will take part in Monterey’s annual History Fest.
</p><p>The fest, set for Oct. 13 and 14, offers a variety of programs for residents and visitors to learn about Monterey's cultural heritage and historic resources.
</p><p>On Oct. 13, at 10:30 a.m., Dr. Mendoza (pictured at right), archaeologist for the Royal Presidio Chapel conservation project, will give a tour of the interior of the chapel followed by a walking tour of archaeological sites around the church. From 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., his students will demonstrate archaeological practices for finding artifacts.
</p><p>Dr. Mendoza, a founding faculty member of CSU Monterey Bay, says that discovering the Serra chapels at the Royal Presidio of Monterey is among his most significant work. In the summer of 2008, he unearthed the “first” and “second” chapels, each consisting of rectangular adobe buildings located directly in front of the present San Carlos Cathedral (constructed in 1791-95). The area marks the spot where, in 1770, Father Junipero Serra celebrated the earliest Mass in a formally constructed church on the California coast. Students in CSUMB’s Division of Social, Behavioral and Global Studies can pursue a concentration in archaeology. Each year, 15 to 20 students do so, many of them attracted by the prospect of working with Dr. Mendoza.
