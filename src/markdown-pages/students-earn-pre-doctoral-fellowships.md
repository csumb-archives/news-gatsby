<p>Four CSU Monterey Bay students – whose research interests include gene splicing, agricultural pathogens, population dynamics in Monterey Bay and computer network security – have been recognized by the California Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Program.</p><p>Three of the award winners –Julio Martinez, Elisabeth Carrillo and Avery Thurston – were named 2015&#45;16 <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/predoc/scholars/">Sally Casanova Pre&#45;Doctoral Scholars</a>. Each will receive $3,000, with the opportunity to apply for additional research funding during the summer after they graduate in 2016.
</p><p>Megan Golbek earned honorable mention honors, and will receive $2,000.
</p><p>The program is designed to increase diversity within the pool of university faculty by supporting the doctoral aspirations of CSU students.
</p><p>Awards are based on competitive review of applications and made to students who, in the judgment of the review panel, demonstrate academic excellence and are committed to a career in teaching and research at the college or university level.
</p><p>The awards can be used for graduate school preparation activities and for summer research.
</p><p>“These awards are quite competitive and normally go to CSU graduate students moving on to Ph.D. degree programs, so having our undergraduates earn this honor is indeed noteworthy,” Provost Bonnie Irwin said in announcing the winners.
</p><p>All awardees have worked closely with their mentors and CSUMB’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center to meet their graduate school goals.
</p><p>Award winners:
</p><p><strong>• Julio Martinez, biology</strong>
</p><p>Starting in mid&#45;June, Martinez will study human bacterial infections at UC Berkeley. In the fall, he will start a position as a lab technician at the USDA Agriculture Research Service in Albany, Cal. His goal is to obtain a Ph.D. in food safety, funded through a USDA fellowship.
</p><p><strong>•</strong> <strong>Avery Thurston, psychology</strong>
</p><p>For eight weeks starting June 1, Thurston, using his training as a marine scientist studying population dynamics, will research the effects of stigma on the LGBTQ+ community with Dr. Cheryl Kaiser at the University of Washington, as a stepping stone to pursue a Ph.D. in social psychology.
</p><p><strong>• Elisabeth Carrillo, biology</strong>
</p><p>At UC Santa Cruz, Carrillo is investigating how alternative gene splicing is regulated in the organism <em>C.elegans.</em>
</p><p><strong>• Megan Golbek, math</strong>
</p><p>At Oregon State University, Golbek is working to optimize secure computation protocols to improve network security.
</p><p>Martinez and Thurston were awarded approximately $5,500 each for their summer work – to cover the cost of housing, meals and a research stipend.
