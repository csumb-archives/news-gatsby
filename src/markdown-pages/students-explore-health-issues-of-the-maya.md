<p>The mystery and grandeur of the Yucatan Peninsula has beckoned travelers for centuries. This month, a group of 14 Cal State Monterey Bay students and several faculty members are among those visiting the area.</p><p>The CSUMB contingent is supported by a grant from the 100,000 Strong in the Americas, a State Department initiative that encourages student exchanges between the U.S. and other Western Hemisphere countries.
</p><p>The intent of the grant is to promote study abroad in health and nutrition, with a focus on identifying solutions to help prevent and reduce obesity.
</p><p>The students – who are earning credit in CHHS 230: Social Justice and Global Health – are visiting archaeological sites, clinics, hospitals and foundations. They are working to access the mental health, nutrition, exercise and water sanitation needs in a Mayan village.
