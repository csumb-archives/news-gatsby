<p>In Salinas, many think media coverage trends toward the sensational, especially in a community where gang-related crimes have propelled the youth homicide rate to the worst in the state. Media coverage was the focus of a study and presentation by a group of CSU Monterey Bay students who invited journalists, law enforcement officials, community activists and local residents to an open discussion. The students' findings were presented in the program Media Coverage of Youth Violence in Salinas. â€“ Monterey Herald, May 11, 2011
