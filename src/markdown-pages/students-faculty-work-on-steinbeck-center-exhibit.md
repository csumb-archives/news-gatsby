<p>CSU Monterey Bay students and faculty members have played a key role in an exhibit at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.
</p><p>Art Department chair Lila Staples co-curated an exhibit with the center’s Deborah Silguero that showcases the works of artists Belle Yang and her father, Joseph Yang.
</p><p>Students in Professor Angelica Muro’s digital art class were involved in the design and fabrication of the exhibition.
</p><p>The exhibit opened on Aug. 4 and will be on display through Oct. 28.
</p><p>On Sept. 22, Dr. Staples (pictured at right) will present a slide lecture discussing the playful and profound aspects of the works in the show. Details are available on the Steinbeck Center website.
</p><p>According to Silguero, curator of exhibitions and collections at the Steinbeck Center, Muro’s students designed a three-dimensional “viewer-participation gallery” based on Belle Yang’s artistic books and characters.
</p><p>“Her characters come to life though projected and digital images, a children’s reading interactive area, kinetic art, and much more,” Silguero said. One installation features a koi pond with projections of fish moving around. A winged image of Belle Yang hangs from the ceiling, taken from one of her own visuals. The wings flap and move. The children’s reading area includes a metal installation with magnetized models of her animal characters.
