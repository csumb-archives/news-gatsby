<p>Sarah Hollingsworth was lucky to land a good person to interview. As part of an ongoing oral history project CSU Monterey Bay is conducting in the Chinatown area of Salinas, Hollingsworth was assigned to talk to Dorothy Wallace, a 91-year-old resident of Italian and Swiss heritage. . . The interview is one of 27 that will be featured in an upcoming screening at the National Steinbeck Center. â€“ <em>Monterey Herald</em>, Nov. 27, 2012
