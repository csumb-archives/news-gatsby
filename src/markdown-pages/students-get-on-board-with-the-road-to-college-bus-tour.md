</p><p>The California State University is taking to the road with the message of academic preparation, access for underserved students and the need for future workforce professionals in California.
</p><p> 
</p><p>From April 12 to May 14, thousands of middle and high school students at nearly 40 stops statewide are expected to board a 40-foot, diesel-powered, "wired" bus wrapped with the "Road to College: Get on Board" theme. The bus contains laptop computers with career exploration, academic preparation and financial aid planning information.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The bus will make a stop at Washington Middle School in Salinas on May 5. Starting at approximately 11:30 a.m., groups of students will be invited to climb aboard to learn about preparing for college. They will be able to sit at the computer stations and watch videos about college life, preparing for college and the CSU system. And they'll have the opportunity to interact with 10 CSUMB students who will be on hand to talk with them about college requirements and opportunities, as well as financial aid.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The Road to College tour is designed to provide youngsters with the tools to create a better future â€“ and to take that message to them in their own communities.
</p><p> 
</p><p>The Road to College tour is the result of a partnership between the CSU and AT&amp;T, which donated $500,000 for the project.
