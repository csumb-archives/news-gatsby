<p>Two CSU Monterey Bay students are about to get an up-close look at the inner workings of government.
</p><p>In late August, Jesse Reyes and Dahlia Ezekwonna will travel to Washington, D.C.,where they will spend the semester working as interns and earning academic credit.
</p><p>Reyes is a senior majoring in environmental studies. He is passionate about conservation and committed to keeping green spaces accessible to young people.
</p><p>He will work with the Department of the Interiorâ€™s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. While in D.C., he also hopes to learn how non-profit environmental organizations operate.
</p><p>Ezekwonna is a global studies major from Grenoble, France. She is interested in international affairs, and hopes to work at an embassy during her internship since she aspires to a career in diplomacy.
</p><p>Both students received $5,000 scholarships from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and $2,500 from CSUMB to help with the costs. The Met Life scholarships became available as part of the <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2013/jul/29/another-service-learning-award-csumb">Higher Education Civic Engagement Award</a> the university's <a href="http://service.csumb.edu">Service Learning</a> program won last year. 
</p><p>The Washington Center arranges internships for approximately 300 students each semester. The students work 35 to 40 hours a week and take academic courses, including a leadership forum, at the center.
