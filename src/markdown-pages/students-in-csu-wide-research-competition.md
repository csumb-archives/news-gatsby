<h2>Event highlights excellence in student research</h2><p>Outstanding research by CSU Monterey Bay students on topics ranging from juvenile offenders to the distribution of mammals on former Fort Ord land will be presented at a system-wide competition next month.
</p><p>Five student projects were selected by a committee of CSUMB’s Faculty Senate to represent the university at the 26th annual CSU Student Research Competition at Long Beach State May 4 and 5. In Long Beach, students will make 10-minute oral presentations before juries of professional experts from major corporations, foundations, public agencies, colleges and universities in California. The judges also review each student’s research paper. The purpose of the competition is to focus attention on the outstanding accomplishments of students engaged in significant research and creative activity in all academic disciplines across the 23-campus CSU system.
