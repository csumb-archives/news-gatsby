</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay senior Rachel Osias was honored Nov. 13 as the Outstanding Philanthropic Young Adult at the 2009 Central Coast National Philanthropy Day awards luncheon.
</p><p>The program honors individuals who "set the standard for community involvement." Osias certainly does that.
</p><p>A Service Learning Student Leader since 2006, she contributes to both her primary service site, the Agriculture and Land-based Training Association (ALBA), and to service learning action projects on campus.
</p><p>In the last academic year alone, Osias (pictured at left) and other SL student leaders brought 80 local middle school students to campus for College Access Weekend, led drives that collected more than $7,000 worth of food for families in the Pajaro Valley and Alisal communities, and put together a "hunger banquet," in which participants experienced and then discussed issues related to food access, poverty and gender inequality.
</p><p>"Rachel truly connects her consciousness and values with her actions," said Professor Deborah Burke, one of her service learning instructors.
</p><p>An Environmental Science, Technology &amp; Policy major with minors in both outdoor education and service learning, Osias plans to work as an environmental educator after graduation.
</p><p>"I want to talk with the public and with youth about where we live and what is happening to it, and instill a sense of stewardship," she said.
</p><p>The Castro Valley native said her dream is to one day open a residential camp that would provide outdoor and environmental education, particularly for the benefit of inner-city and deaf children.
</p><p>This is the first time a young adult was honored at the Central Coast National Philanthropy Day event. Established in 1986, National Philanthropy Day is celebrated in more than 100 communities.
