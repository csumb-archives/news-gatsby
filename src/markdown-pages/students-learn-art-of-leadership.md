</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay will hold its annual Student Leadership Conference on Saturday in the University Center.
</p><p>"By teaching students how to think ethically, make good decisions, be socially and emotionally intelligent, communicate effectively and manage their time and stress level, they will have the tools to be leaders," said Kelly Mailly, coordinator of leadership development.
</p><p>"CSUMB is committed to developing our future leaders."
</p><p>The university has held a leadership conference for the last five years. It took off in 2008, after resources were made available to hire a staff member who focuses solely on leadership development. Attendance climbed from 20 two years ago to 140 last year.
</p><p>No single training session makes someone a good leader; it's the culmination of skills that a person accumulates over time, Mailly said.
</p><p>This year, the conference is attempting to engage students at a deeper level through its theme, "Leadership in Turbulent Times."
</p><p>Keynote speaker is Corey Ciochetti. An assistant professor of business ethics and legal studies at the University of Denver, Ciochetti (pictured at left) encourages students to chase the truly important things in life such as a solid character, strong personal relationships and a sense of contentment. These are contrasted to worldly types of success such as excessive wealth, popularity and prestige. Audience members will get a sense of what it takes to develop character, set priorities, and gain a big-picture perspective.
</p><p>Speaker Andrea Mosby-Jones (pictured at right) will remind students of the importance of thoughtful decisions in their lives. College students are faced with tough choices on a regular basis and need to learn the confidence to make good decisions that will lead them on a path to success. She'll walk them through the factors they must consider when making important personal choices. From having determination to taking control of their lives, students will see how to lead themselves and their organizations to a successful place.
</p><p>Jeff Stafford will make a presentation on the skills needed to handle difficult situations and the emotions that might be attached to them.
</p><p>A variety of other workshops will be offered throughout the day. Cost is $10 for CSUMB students and $15 for other students. To register, call 582-4625.
