<p>Students at CSU Monterey Bay will gather on Feb. 13 to protest sexual violence toward women across the globe as part of the “<a href="http://onebillionrising.org/">One Billion Rising</a>” movement.
</p><p>A variety of campus organizations – the Title IX Task Force, the University Police Department, Associated Students, the Asian Pacific Islander Association, the Music and Performing Arts Department and Sodexo, among others – are sponsoring the event, which will be held in the main quad from 2 to 5 p.m.
</p><p>“One Billion Rising” was initiated by Eve Ensler, the creator of “The Vagina Monologues” – which is performed at CSUMB every year on or around Valentine’s Day. This year’s production is scheduled for Feb. 12, 13 and 14 at 8 p.m. in the World Theater.
</p><p>According to the One Billion Rising website, the protest was inspired by the statistic that one in three women on the planet will be raped or beaten, which equals 1 billion women.
</p><p>During the inaugural events on Valentine’s Day 2013, men and women around the world gathered to dance in protest of this statistic.
</p><p>The university will take part in the campus version of the movement, which focuses on stopping sexual violence on campuses, increasing awareness, and focusing on making student safety a top priority.
</p><p>“CSUMB and the surrounding community will rise in unity to dance and sing with a singular voice to demand an end to sexual and gender violence in own community,” said Anna Bartkowski, a deputy Title IX officer at CSUMB.
