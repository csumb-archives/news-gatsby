<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s Visual and Public Art Department has collaborated with Marina High School to produce a second mural based on the school’s motto, Navigate the Future.
</p><p>Last year, students from Professor Johanna Poethig’s painting and mural class exchanged ideas and drawings with the Marina High students. The result: a mural that featured a lighthouse and a yellow brick road with ancient footprints that lead to a universe of endless possibilities. The mural adorns a wall on the Marina campus.
</p><p>This year, a high school student suggested that loggerhead turtles be incorporated into a second mural. The student pointed out that the turtles have an internal navigation system that allows them to use the earth’s magnetic field to find their way.
</p><p>The mural includes four large turtles that were painted on non-woven media, attached to the wall with acrylic gel and painted into the scene.
</p><p>The official unveiling took place on Dec. 11. Students and administrators from both schools were in attendance, along with alumni John Elliott and <a href="http://give.csumb.edu/news/2011/oct/19/donor-profile-roxana-keland">Roxana Keland</a>.
