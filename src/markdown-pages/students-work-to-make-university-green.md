<p>A 10-week competition got under way Jan. 17 aimed at encouraging students to recycle.
</p><p>Part of a nationwide event called RecycleMania, the program pits the eight residence halls on the main campus against each other to see which one recycles the most. A separate competition involves the three buildings in the North Quad complex."I think we can look forward to being seen as a green campus," Environmental Senator Duane Lindsay said. "It will probably take a few years for students to get in the habit of recycling, but making students aware of the importance of it will help further efforts" toward a green campus.
</p><p>Students can participate by using the small blue bins that were delivered to each dorm room last fall, and then emptying the bins in their building's blue dumpster. The amount - measured in pounds - of recycled materials will be weighed weekly; the buildings with the most recycled material will receive a trophy and recognition from the student environmental group.
</p><p>This year, CSUMB is entered in the noncompetitive "benchmark" division of RecycleMania. The information gathered will be used to establish a baseline, which will give the university the opportunity to compete next year. Recycling is one of the ways the university is working toward reducing its carbon footprint in accordance with the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment. President Dianne Harrison signed the commitment in June 2007.   Began in 2001, RecycleMania has seen the number of participating schools increase yearly. More than 607 campuses across the country are competing this year. Last year, CSU San Marcos won the national title for the fifth time, beating out 450 other schools. CSU Chico was second best in the state last year and seventh in the nation. The competition ends March 27; results will be published in April at <a href="http://news/students-work-make-university-green.org/">news/students-work-make-university-green.org</a>.
