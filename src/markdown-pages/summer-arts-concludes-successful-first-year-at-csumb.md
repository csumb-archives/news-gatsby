<h2>Student evaluations the best they've ever been</h2><p><em><a href="http://blogs.calstate.edu/voicesviews/?p=1510">View a photo blog of Summer Arts</a></em>
</p><p>Students from throughout the California State University system and beyond came to Cal State Monterey Bay in July for the annual Summer Arts program.
</p><p>CSU Summer Arts kicked off the first year of a five-year run at the Seaside campus with more than three hundred students taking the opportunity to explore and master the arts in 13 for-credit classes. Another class was offered in Florence, Italy.
</p><p>Workshops were taught by experts in theater, dance, film, music, art, animation, writing and new media.
</p><p>“The first year was a huge success,” said Joanne Sharp, assistant director of Summer Arts. “The student evaluations were the best they have ever been. That’s the real measure of success.”
</p><p>Classes were held in two-week sessions; each ended with a “culmination,” where students demonstrated what they had learned in an event open to the public.
</p><p>“We got great attendance at the culminations,” Sharp said.
</p><p>The area’s summer arts scene got a lot more interesting with the addition of public performances by the visiting artists held most nights throughout the month.
</p><p>Attendance at the public events picked up over the last 10 days, according to Sharp, putting it "where we expected it to be,” she said.
