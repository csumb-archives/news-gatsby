  This year marks the 30th anniversary of CSU Summer Arts, and the program –
  which starts in late June – invites students to register now for this year’s
  classes.
</p>
<p>
  Summer Arts, which began as a small dance program in 1985, has transformed the
  lives of more than 12,000 student artists since its inception and has grown
  into one of California State University’s most dynamic, hands&#45;on programs.
</p>

  “Many students come to CSU Summer Arts expecting to take classes that will
  refine their skills, but soon find out our program is life&#45;changing,” said
  Rachel Nardo, Summer Arts director.
</p>
<p>
  Students master various art forms including dance, music, acting, media arts,
  fine arts and creative writing. The program – hosted by CSU Monterey Bay –
  prepares students for workforce success through leading&#45;edge courses and
  superior teaching. Over a two&#45; to three&#45;week period, students broaden
  their artistic skills by working with Academy Award&#45;winning professionals,
  entertainment industry moguls and legendary artists through a series of
  workshops and courses.
</p>
<p>
  CSU Summer Arts sessions run at varying times between June 29 and Aug. 17. At
  the end of each session, students exhibit their artwork in a showcase festival
  that is free to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, guest artists put on performances and presentations for students
  and the local community nearly every night throughout the duration of the
  program.
</p>

  artists including:
