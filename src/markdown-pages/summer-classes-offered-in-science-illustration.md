<p>Anyone interested in exploring the confluence of art and science is invited to attend the summer session of CSU Monterey Bay’s Science Illustration program.
</p><p>Classes in marine science illustration and digital science illustration will be offered in a five-week session starting July 19.
</p><p>While this is the first time summer classes have been offered on the CSUMB campus – where the program moved in the fall of 2009 – they were available when the program was based at UC Santa Cruz.
</p><p>“Classes have been attended by people from the community, high school students, professional artists, art students who need a science elective, and elementary school teachers who want to develop science units for their classes,” said program director Ann Caudle.
</p><p>It’s also a good way to learn about the program.
</p><p>“People interested in applying to the year-long Science Illustration program and want to get a taste for what it is have also taken summer classes,” Caudle said. “A substantial number of our former summer students have successfully applied to our regular graduate program.”
</p><p>The summer classes are geared to a wide range of student levels. While there is a set curriculum, there is also one-on-one teaching. The beginner will get plenty of guidance and practical training.
</p><p>“I’ve seen amazing progress in just a few weeks,” Caudle said.
</p><p>Professionals or near-professionals can widen their skill sets, try new approaches and fine-tune their observation skills and the quality of their illustrations.
</p><p>The marine science class will explore marine subjects and their environment, using watercolor and mixed-media techniques. The digital science class will use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop in conjunction with traditional techniques. The goal is to make science accessible to everyone. No prior art or science experience is necessary.
</p><p>Both classes will be taught by Amadeo Bachar, an instructor in the regular program. Bachar is also a freelance artist whose clients include National Geographic, Scientific American and the California Department of Fish and Game.
</p><p>The fee for each class is $585. For more information, call (831) 582-4500. To download a registration form, click <a href="http://extended.csumb.edu/summer-2011.htm">here</a>.
