<h3>Clothing designer Alice Wu visits campus April 18</h3><p>For more than a decade, Alice Wu, half of the fashion design team Feral Childe, has been designing original and unusual clothing.
</p><p>Wu will visit CSU Monterey Bay on April 18 as the Visual and Public Art Department’s Visiting Artist series concludes for the spring semester. The presentation will start at 6 p.m. in the University Center.
</p><p>Feral Childe started in New York City, where Wu and her partner, Moriah Carlson, met during art school. After graduation, they started collaborating on various creative projects and found their focus shifting to textiles and fabrics.
</p><p>Wu and Carlson approach garments from a sculptural perspective, resulting in clothes described as “built rather than sewn.” Feral Childe is known for its original textiles, hand-finished trims, and surprising construction details. All pieces are made with an eye to sustainability – from choice of fabric, printing and dyeing treatments, to details such as buttons and trim – and are manufactured in New York City.
</p><p>Collections are represented through performance, installation, collage, film, photography and music, often in cahoots with creative co-conspirators. Wu, who is based in Oakland and New York City, has presented projects across the United States and internationally, including Denmark, Japan, Qatar and Canada, in both traditional art venues and through independent clothing retailers.
</p><p>The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street. While the event is free, visitors must purchase a parking permit fron a dispenser on the lot. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>.
