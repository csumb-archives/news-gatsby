<p>The upcoming baseball playoffs will have a Boss soundtrack, thanks to the work of Casey Richards (TAT, ’02).
</p><p>Turner Broadcasting selected Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band – who recently played a two-night set at Boston’s famed Fenway Park – for the 2012 Major League Baseball postseason ad campaign.
</p><p>Richards was the writer/producer of the two-minute music video, along with the accompanying "Legends Are Born in October" commercials that will be shown throughout September and October on TBS, ESPN, Fox, MBL Network, YouTube and screens inside every major league baseball stadium. 
</p><p>“It was an honor to work with a music and American icon like Mr. Springsteen,” Richards said in an email. "The campaign was a lot of fun but also a lot of work. I was buried inside a dark edit suite for months!"
</p><p>The video features Springsteen performing “Land of Hope and Dreams” from his Wrecking Ball album, cut with highlights of the baseball season. <a href="https://vimeo.com/48831872">View it here</a>.
</p><p>It’s not the first baseball video Richards has worked on. Earlier this year, he was the writer/producer behind MLB's opening day broadcast on TBS, collaborating with the band Imagine Dragons and their hit single, "It's Time." <a href="http://vimeo.com/39974742">View it here</a>. 
</p><p>Richards’ career has taken him across the country several times. After graduating in 2002, he worked for an advertising agency in Los Angeles, part of the in-house video editorial team. That was followed by a move to Atlanta, where he worked as an associate writer/producer for on-air promotions at Turner Broadcasting. A couple of years later, he moved to Fox Sports – but stayed in Atlanta. In 2008, an opportunity presented itself at E! Entertainment in Los Angeles, where he worked as a writer/producer of on-air promotions. Then another cross-country move – back to Turner where he is currently employed as a writer/producer in the Creative Services Sports Unit, the network’s in-house advertising operation for all the company's sports properties, including professional basketball, NASCAR, golf and college basketball. “I didn’t target sports out of school,” Richards said. “I fell into sports out of necessity when the network I was working for was taken over by Fox Sports. It's the same way I got into reality television when accepting a job at E! Regardless of the content, I've always adapted and all my jobs have been on the creative side of the industry.” But sports is not unfamiliar territory for him. He’s always been a baseball and basketball fan, he said. “I played baseball from T-ball through high school. When I got to CSUMB, there wasn’t a team, but I remained a sports fan while I studied television. Now it's fun to have a job that lets me enjoy both.” Despite the lack of a baseball team – the sport was added after he graduated – “I had a unique experience at CSUMB,” he said, referring to the fact that he was a student during the university’s early years.
</p><p>"I owe a lot of my success to the hands-on training – with state-of-the-art technology – I received as a TAT major. It definitely gave me an advantage in the job market right out of college," Richards said.
</p><p>"It was my emphasis on post-production that helped me break into a <em>very</em> competitive industry and set me on the path to where I am today."
