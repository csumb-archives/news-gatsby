<p>Christopher Marcos is proving that students in the Teledramatic Arts and Technology program at CSU Monterey Bay can excel on both sides of the camera.
</p><p>Marcos is currently starring in Pacific Repertory Theatre's production of the Broadway musical, "All Shook Up," the first offering of the theater's School of Dramatic Arts.
</p><p>"All Shook Up" is set in 1955. Marcos plays the lead role of Chad, a hip-swiveling, guitar-playing stranger who comes to town and falls in love with a local girl who dreams of leaving her sleepy town for the more exciting life of the big city.
</p><p>The story is inspired by Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night<em>"</em> and is based around the songs of Elvis Presley.
</p><p>"One of the fun things about this production is that, instead of having the Elvis-inspired music as a background score, each of the 25 tunes actually advances the plot," director Stephen Moorer told the Monterey Herald.
</p><p>Marcos is learning about Elvis and his music.
</p><p>"I knew most of his music, but it wasn't on my iPod," he told the Herald. "I never imagined myself playing Elvis or singing Elvis songs – but the play has opened my eyes. I'm definitely an Elvis fan now. There are a lot of songs I'd never heard of before and I've started loving them."
</p><p>Marcos is the leader of a local hip-hop dance crew called the Infamous Night Rockers, who compete in dance tournaments throughout California. He says it's not a big leap from Elvis to hip-hop.
</p><p>"It's not far from what I do – it's a lot of hip stuff," he says of his dancing in the production. He even choreographed dances to "Blue Suede Shoes" and "Don't Be Cruel."
</p><p>"Chris is an up-and-coming talent," said Moorer said. "He's charismatic and real and he sings and dances like crazy."
</p><p>Marcos appeared in several other PacRep productions, including "High School Musical" and "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee," but this is his biggest role.
</p><p>The play will be presented on weekends through Feb. 14 at the Golden Bough Theatre, located on Monte Verde between Eighth and Ninth avenues in Carmel. For tickets or more information, call 622-0100 or go online at <a href="http://www.pacrep.org/">www.pacrep.org</a>.
