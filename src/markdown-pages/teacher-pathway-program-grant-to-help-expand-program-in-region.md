  (TPP), delivered in partnership with local community colleges, has received a
  grant from the Claire Giannini Fund that will support further program growth
  in Monterey County. The grant, totaling $195,819, will provide funding to the
  TPP program to continue the collaborative program with Hartnell College and to
  expand the model to include Monterey Peninsula College (MPC).
</p>
<p>
  MPC is in the process of admitting their first TPP cohort this coming Fall
  term while other funding sources are supporting the TPP model expansion with
  Cabrillo College as they prepare to admit their first cohort at Cabrillo’s
  Watsonville campus this coming Fall semester.
</p>
<p>
  "We are honored to receive this grant. With 98% of our students being from
  underserved backgrounds, these funds will allow us to implement this
  ‘grow-our-own’ teachers program to address the pervasive teacher shortage that
  exists in our region,” said TPP Co-Principal Investigator and Chair of the
  Liberal Studies Department, Deanne Perez-Granados.
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s Teacher Pathway Program aims to help address the urgent need for fully
  credentialed teachers on California’s Central Coast and is unique in its
  collaborative approach and regional focus that includes Hartnell, MPC and
  Cabrillo.
</p>
<p>
  “Our Teacher Pathway Program is designed to eliminate barriers to ensure that
  our local talent is able to pursue workforce training that allows them to
  become educators who serve their local communities and are reflective of the
  students taught in our local schools,” said CSUMB College of Education Dean,
  Jose Luis Alvarado. “The program is truly unique in the CSU system and is just
  one example of the potential that CSUMB offers to collaboratively address the
  workforce needs of our region.”
</p>
<p>
  In three years since the Teacher Pathway Program launched, 84% of students in
  the first cohort earned their Associate Degree for Transfer (AA-T) in two
  years and 88% of students in the second cohort earned their AA-T in two years
  while retention rates for program participants far surpass the retention rates
  of students enrolled in traditional programs.
</p>
<p>
  With the support of the Claire Giannini Fund, Hartnell College and CSUMB built
  the teacher pathway program, now starting its fourth year, with an eye towards
  sustainability; ensuring this project continues to prepare fully qualified
  elementary and special education teachers to all of Monterey County
  communities well into the future.
