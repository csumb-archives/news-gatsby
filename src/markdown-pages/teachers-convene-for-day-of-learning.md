As California leads the way to implement new, more rigorous standards, Better Together: California Teachers Summit provided an opportunity for teachers to share best practices and build a network of colleagues to support future collaboration.

Keynote addresses were delivered via video stream by actress and teacher advocate Yvette Nicole Brown and astronaut and STEM education pioneer Leland Melvin. They spoke about the potential of teachers to spark curiosity, creativity and a love of learning in their students.
</p><p>Based on the EdCamp model of professional learning, the summit featured breakout sessions where teachers shared ideas and innovative strategies that are working in classrooms across the state. Teachers also heard talks by local teachers who offered perspectives on their successes with implementation of the California Standards.

The free summit was co&#45;sponsored by the California Department of Education and supported by grants from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the S.D. Bechtel Jr. Foundation and the Silver Giving Foundation.
