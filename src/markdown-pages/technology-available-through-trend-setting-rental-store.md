<p>More than a traditional equipment check-out service, TechRent is an innovative program that makes technology affordable for CSUMB students. It offers flexible terms that let students keep devices for a day, week, month or semester. Students may even choose to purchase a rented device by applying their rental fees toward the items' cost. â€“ EdTech magazine, May 24, 2011
