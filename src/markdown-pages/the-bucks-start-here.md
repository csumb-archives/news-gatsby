<h3>Learn how to use ‘crowd funding’</h3><p>In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups – JOBS – Act was signed into law. It has a “crowd funding” amendment that changes restrictions on how businesses can raise capital.
</p><p>That topic will be explored at the April 8 Entrepreneurship Forum at CSU Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The forum, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the World Theater, will focus on the changes in funding opportunities for new and growing ventures created by the JOBS Act. The act creates opportunities for fundraising on the Internet using platforms such as Kickstarter; it also allows equity fundraising for small companies through funding portals.
</p><p>The event is free, but community members are asked to register <a href="http://tinyurl.com/Crowdcsumb">here</a>.
</p><p>Jim White, chief executive officer of JL White International, and Dr. Brad Barbeau of the School of Business will make presentations.
</p><p>Mr. White was directly involved in the JOBS Act legislation, and is an expert on the topic. Dr. Barbeau teaches economics and entrepreneurship, and is an expert on developing business models for startup companies.
</p><p>The presenters will speak on the current state of crowd funding and the opportunities created by the JOBS Act legislation. Audience members will have an opportunity to ask questions.
