</p><p>The fifth annual Mud Run – in which participants climb hills, vault over walls, crawl through a tunnel and slog through pits of mud – will be held March 27 starting at 9 a.m. at Freeman Stadium on Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard.
</p><p>Who says raising money for a good cause has to be good, clean fun?
</p><p>The Mud Run is sponsored by CSU Monterey Bay, the Big Sur International Marathon and the Presidio of Monterey and benefits the university's athletic scholarship fund and Presidio charities.
</p><p>Patterned after the popular mud run at Camp Pendleton, Army and Marine drill sergeants will bark orders to motivate participants along the way. While it's too late to register for this year's event, spectators are invited to watch from the area outside the stadium and along the course. Awards will be handed out at 10:30 a.m. for the top five individual male and female runners in their age group, and the top three teams. All finishers will get a T-shirt, a medallion and a shower.
</p><p>Interested runners can sign up for next year's Mud Run starting Nov.1. For more information, visit the web at <a href="http://www.bigsurmudrun.org/">www.bigsurmudrun.org</a> or call 625-6226.
