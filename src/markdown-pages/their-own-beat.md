<p>San Jose Taiko will take the stage at California State University, Monterey Bayâ€™s World Theater on March 7. Showtime is 8 p.m.</p><p>The word <em>taiko</em> is Japanese for drum, and the art of drumming has been a staple of Japanese culture for centuries.
</p><p>The group was formed in 1973 by young Asian Americans who were searching for an outlet to convey their experiences as <em>sansei</em> or third&#45;generation Japanese Americans. Looking to Japan for inspiration, they were drawn to the empowering sounds of the taiko, an instrument that embodies the spiritual essence and heartbeat of Japan.
</p><p>By studying with masters of other traditions and cultures, San Jose Taiko musicians have broadened and embellished this traditional art form. Their style joins the traditional rhythms of Japanese drumming with the beat of world rhythms, including African, Brazilian, Filipino, Latin and jazz. The sound is contemporary, exciting and innovative, bridging many styles while still resonant of the Asian soul in America.
