<h3>Eight hands plus one cello = lots of fun</h3><p>Stringfever, a London-based string quartet, is a little bit classical, a little bit rock 'n' roll – and humorous. 
</p><p>The foursome, which includes the Broadbent brothers (Giles, Ralph and Neal) and their cousin Graham, will perform at 7:30 p.m., April 3, at CSU Monterey Bay’s <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu">World Theater</a>. The musicians, trained at London's Royal Academy and College of Music, will play American favorites with their brightly colored five- and six-stringed electric violins, viola and cello. Their unusually shaped instruments are handmade to order in the United Kingdom.
</p><p>Stringfever’s version of Ravel’s Bolero has all four playing one cello simultaneously. Then they challenge the audience to play Name That Tune as they race through 20 of the best-loved film themes in one arrangement. A medley of James Bond themes follows. The signature finale, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG6Ef-NQCi4">“The History of Music . . . in 5 Minutes,”</a> is one of the highlights of their performance – a compilation of 40 tunes packed into a frenetic five minutes.
</p><p>Audience members are raving about Stringfever, said Joe Cardinelli, artistic director of the World Theater Presents series. "Their performances have been described as spellbinding, brilliant, wild, wacky and wholly watchable. Our audience will be delighted they came." Tickets are $29 general admission.
