<p>ANNUAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY ADDRESS KICKS OFF SCHOOL YEAR</p><p>President Eduardo Ochoa delivered an upbeat State of the University address Aug. 20 at the World Theater as he noted school achievements as well as plans for the future.
</p><p>“Overall, it has been an outstanding year for Cal State Monterey Bay,” President Ochoa said. “The signs of progress are all around us.”
</p><p>Twenty years ago next month, President Bill Clinton attended the dedication of the university. He told the crowd, “Think about possibilities, not problems. Believe in the future.”

President Ochoa struck that theme in his remarks. “Today – two decades after President Clinton’s speech – I believe the future is here for Cal State Monterey Bay,” he said. “While we cannot totally discount any problems, I would like to echo President Clinton’s remarks from that momentous day.

“Think about possibilities. Believe in the future.”

He sketched out his vision for the next decade, in which the university will be at the heart of a flourishing and sustainable community. That vision includes:

• Serving as a catalyst and a partner to strengthen the region’s economy, and developing programs such as sustainable hospitality and ag management in collaboration with local industry leaders;
</p><p>• Enhancing the university’s distinctive programs including marine science, business, math, education, nursing, health sciences, the arts, and others;
</p><p>• Working with all sectors of education – pre&#45;kindergarten to community college – to raise the educational achievement of local youth;
</p><p>• Supporting local organizations through service learning and community engagement, and partnering with leaders of all social sectors to help share the region’s future.
</p><p>President Ochoa pointed to signs of progress that include new classrooms, expanded programs, new housing, planning for a new student union, more international students, increases in enrollment, retention and graduation rates and grant funding. “All these are unmistakable signs of a maturing university,” he said.
</p><p>And he talked with pride about the $8 million in state innovation awards the campus earned last spring – 16 percent of the available pool of money. “That is why I have taken to referring to us as the most innovative public university in California,” he said. The grants went to the CS&#45;in&#45;3 program, a three&#45;year bachelor’s degree in computer science, delivered in partnership with Hartnell College, and to a developmental math program.
</p><p>The president said he hopes to have an announcement soon about the university’s pending agreement with the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas. “Our presence in the Steinbeck Center offers a tremendous opportunity for us to extend our outreach into Salinas and the Salinas Valley,” he said. “While our plans have not been finalized, we see it as having great potential as a site for professional education and conferences, degree completion programs and admissions and counseling activities.”
</p><p>He ended by reminding the audience that the university was created to be a driver of innovation and progress for the area and the state.
</p><p>“We have a clear, worthy mission; institutional structures that align with that mission; and a culture that is open and welcoming of innovation and change,” he said. “These three elements are essential for transformative institutions. And CSUMB is a transformative institution. We are ready to take the next step.
</p><p>“Twenty years ago, the audience that gathered to hear President Clinton speak could only imagine how far Cal State Monterey Bay might come.
</p><p>“Now, we begin our third decade.
</p><p>“Think about possibilities. Believe in the future.”
</p><p>As the program continued, employee service awards were presented to 51 people who have been with the university for five years; 10&#45;year pins were awarded to 37 staff members; 32 people were acknowledged for 15 years of service; and 28 employees were presented with 20&#45;year pins.
