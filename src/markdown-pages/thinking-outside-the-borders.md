<h3>La Santa Cecilia – A band with a message</h3><p>La Santa Cecilia is set to rock CSU Monterey Bay’s University Center on Oct. 29.
</p><p>Coming off its recent Grammy win for “Best Latin Rock/Alternative/Urban Album,” La Santa Cecilia has enchanted its fans with diverse genres, powerful lyrical messages and colorful performances.
</p><p>Band members are accordionist and requintero José “Pepe” Carlos, bassist Alex Bendaña, and percussionist Miguel Ramirez and lead vocalist Marisol Hernandez, La Marisoul, who sings about love, loss and heartbreak. Their love of music and openness to all genres led them to form La Santa Cecilia in 2007, named for the patron saint of musicians.
</p><p>Their influences range from Miles Davis to The Beatles, Led Zeppelin to Janis Joplin and Mercedes Sosa to Ramon Ayala.
</p><p>In 2013, the band released its major label debut Treinta Dias (30 Days), which features a collaboration with Elvis Costello. Their new album, Someday New, features seven new tracks including the moving, and militant, ICE – El Hielo.
</p><p>The band has emerged as a voice for traditionally voiceless and faceless immigrants. “La Santa Cecilia reflects a pivotal moment in the evolving cultural understanding of undocumented immigrants,” the Washington Post said of the band last year when it performed in the nation’s capital, pressing for reform of current immigrant laws.
</p><p>Showtime is 7 p.m. in the University Center, located on Sixth Avenue at B Street. General admissions tickets are $20; students $10; children $5. Discounts are available for seniors and military members. Tickets can be purchased on the World Theater <a href="http://worldtheater.csumb.edu">website</a> or by calling the box office 582-4580.
</p><p>Parking permits are required and may be purchased from a machine on the lot or <a href="http://parking.csumb.edu/buy-permit">online</a>.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
</p><p>The event is sponsored by the Cultural Enrichment Committee of Associated Students; Student Activities and Leadership Development; and University Performances and Special Events.
