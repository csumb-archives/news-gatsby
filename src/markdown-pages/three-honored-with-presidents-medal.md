</p><p>Melissa Mercado, Laura Lee Lienk and Rikk Kvitek were honored for their leadership and dedication to the CSU Monterey Bay vision at the Day of Welcome and President's Medal Ceremony Aug. 17.
</p><p>Several hundred people attended the event in the World Theater.
</p><p>In her remarks, President Dianne Harrison acknowledged the challenges posed by the state budget crisis, and its impact on the university.
</p><p>"I feel like I've been on a roller coaster ride since May - a ride with steep hills and fast slides - always wondering if the track would hold together. I am sure I am not alone," she told the gathering.
</p><p>"Despite these very challenging circumstances, our decisions have always been made with the best interests of our students, our employees and the future of this university in mind."
</p><p>She went on to remind the faculty and staff in attendance that students must remain at the center of their thinking, planning and efforts. Then, she asked a question: How will students succeed in this environment?
</p><p>"I believe it will be due to your passion, your dedication and your rich contribution to their lives and their futures," Dr. Harrison told the gathering.
</p><p>She noted that the university will welcome the largest incoming freshman class ever, totaling 925 students. Another 538 new transfer students have enrolled for the fall. Total enrollment is approximately 4,300, with 1,866 of them living in the residence halls and another 650 residing in East Campus housing.
</p><p>After introducing the members of the President's cabinet, and inviting new employees to share in the tradition of signing the Vision Statement, Dr. Harrison announced the President's Medal recipients.
</p><p>The university community was invited to make nominations. A committee selected finalists for Dr. Harrison's consideration. The nominees represented a cross-section of campus - some have a long history at the university, others joined the university more recently; some have direct contact with students, others have an operational focus.
</p><p>Mercado was honored as the staff recipient of the President's Medal. She started at the university in 2001, and has been in her most recent assignment as academic personnel representative since 2007. Among other things, she was lauded for demonstrating a spirit of teamwork, flexibility and excellence that fosters mutual respect.
</p><p>Lienk, co-director of the Watershed Institute, earned the President's Medal for administrators. In her work at the Watershed Institute, she has brought environmental awareness to thousands of school children and spearheaded the effort to restore habitats throughout the area. In her role as Service Learning coordinator, she has made contributions to faculty and students.
</p><p>Kvitek was awarded the faculty President's Medal. Since coming to CSU Monterey Bay in 1996, he has brought, authored or served as co-principle investigator on more than 60 funded grants and contracts. All of these projects have provided for paid student involvement. One of his former students said, "He brings out the best in people by challenging them and pushing then well beyond their own expectations."
</p><p>Also honored were four emeriti professors - faculty members who have retired recently. They contributed significantly to the university and to their disciplines in their research, teaching, publishing and their work outside of the university.
</p><p>This year's honorees are Diane Cordero de Noriega, John Kim, Robert van Spyk and Ken Wanderman.
