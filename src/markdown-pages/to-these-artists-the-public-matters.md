<p>The Visiting Artist series at Cal State Monterey Bay continues on April 9 with a presentation by Reanne Estrada and Mike Blockstein of <a href="http://www.publicmattersgroup.com">Public Matters</a>, a Los Angeles&#45;based social enterprise.
</p><p>Public Matters works with people to create media about their neighborhoods. The goal is to connect people to the places they live and work and to develop a sense of ownership over these places and a belief that they can directly shape their neighborhoods’ future.The media content reflects and benefits the community that has helped create it, advancing community&#45;defined initiatives &#40;for example, healthy food access in South and East L.A. and increased public awareness of <a href="http://www.publicmattersgroup.com/?page_id=716">immigrant contributions</a> in historic Filipinotown&#41;.
