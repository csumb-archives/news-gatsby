        CSUMB faculty and staff members are currently offering talks on the
        following topics:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Research at CSUMB: Why we do it and what it means for the Monterey Bay
        region
      </h4>
      <p>
        Researchers at the university bring in millions of dollars in grants.
        Those funds create jobs and support the development of new knowledge.
        We&#x2019;re eager to discuss economic development and to share ideas for
        cooperation and collaboration between the university and industry.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by a university administrator.</p>
      <h4>
        From &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding!&#x2019; to &#x2018;Ah-ha!&#x2019; &#x2013; hope for our oceans
        through insight and innovation
      </h4>
      <p>
        The talk discusses innovative ways to address the unprecedented threats
        of climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification, pollution,
        fishery declines, coastal erosion, algal blooms and storm
        intensification on the coastal oceans and communities.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Rikk Kvitek</p>
      <h4>
        Peeling back the blue: how we map and use 3D visualization to reveal and
        learn from Earth&#x2019;s hidden seafloor landscapes
      </h4>
      <p>
        Although the global ocean is the driver of weather, a highway for marine
        commerce, a reservoir of vast marine resources, and our playground, we
        know more about distant planets than we do about the seafloor. Imagine
        if the next time you were standing at the ocean&apos;s edge that instead of
        watching crashing waves, you were able to visualize submarine canyons,
        underwater seamounts and ridges, and even a kelp forest teeming with
        marine life. The State of California has undertaken a cutting-edge
        project to make this possible by mapping the seafloor of all the state&apos;s
        waters. Dr. Kvitek will show you the first images created from this
        effort and share with you how this new information is already being used
        in a multitude of ways.
      </p>

      <h4>Science with a mission at CSUMB</h4>
      <p>
        The CSUMB Science Division includes experts from both terrestrial and
        marine realms. Their common mission is to use sound science to solve
        environmental problems in the tri-county area. They use
        cutting-edge technology and student power for the good of the
        community.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith</p>
      <h4>San Clemente Dam removal</h4>
      <p>
        San Clemente Dam will be removed from the Carmel River to reduce the
        risk of dam failure and to foster the historic salmon run. This
        large-scale project will have long-term impacts on the
        watershed, and could be a model for other dam removal projects in
        California.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith</p>
      <h4>Water resources on the Monterey Peninsula</h4>
      <p>
        People on the coast between Carmel and Seaside have been seeking a
        sustainable water resource for decades. The search has been fraught with
        technical, political and legal pitfalls. What are the technical
        solutions? What are the political/legal constraints? What&apos;s the latest
        plan?
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith</p>
      <h4>
        The geology of coastal Monterey county: resource opportunities and
        geological hazards
      </h4>
      <p>
        Wherever you stand, there is a stack of rocks below your feet that
        records the local geological history and governs the kind of urban
        development that is suited to the region. We will consider the water
        resources and environmental hazards of our region. Water is scarce, and
        urban expansion is locally constrained by coastal erosion, landslides
        and hill slope erosion potential.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Doug Smith</p>
      <h4>Institute For Applied Marine Ecology (IFAME)</h4>
      <p>
        The primary goal of the IfAME is to provide science in support of
        government decision-making ranging from local municipalities to
        state, federal and international governments. That science includes
        monitoring the new state marine protected areas along California&apos;s
        coast, exploring the resources of National Marine Sanctuaries from
        Monterey to New England, studying the impact of commercial bottom
        trawling on seafloor habitats around the world, and diving from the
        world&apos;s only undersea laboratory in the Florida Keys. The closely linked
        secondary goal is to involve CSUMB students in the conduct of this
        research.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. James Lindholm</p>
      <h4>Math, revealed &#x2013; Cracking the mysteries of math for youngsters</h4>
      <p>
        New research examining thousands of students in two dozen California
        school districts finds that students already doing well in math in the
        seventh grade are more likely to take advanced math courses in high
        school and meet college entrance requirements. But for many students who
        struggle with math in grade seven, there is no clear path to learning
        and achievement. CSUMB math professor Hongde Hu uses math games,
        engaging presentations and curriculum he has been refining for years to
        reach those youngsters.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Hongde Hu</p>
      <h4>Innovation in higher education</h4>
      <p>
        Higher education is facing challenges in an era of increased demand,
        changing demographics and declining state support. American colleges and
        universities will need to adopt new educational approaches and
        technologies to serve more students while maintaining quality. CSUMB is
        addressing this through a variety of ways: a new three-year computer
        science degree developed in partnership with Hartnell College; creation
        of an Institute for Innovation and Economic Development; and exploring
        the potential to use technology for online programs.

      <p>Presented by Dr. Eric Tao</p>
      <h4>Eyewitness memory</h4>
      <p>
        Eyewitnesses are notoriously bad in the identification of the
        perpetrator of a crime. If you witness a crime, can you be sure that
        your memory for that event is accurate? Not really. Scientific evidence
        explains that memory changes over time, is malleable and is easy to
        manipulate via suggestibility and misattribution. Find out why
        eyewitnesses are so bad at remembering details of the crime and in the
        identification of the perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita</p>
      <h4>Creating memories for events that never happened</h4>
      <p>
        False memories are the remembering of events that never took place.
        Memory is easily manipulated and can change without our awareness.
        Memory research shows that it is easy to create false memories (for
        example, a memory of getting lost in the mall). One of the issues
        with false memory is that you cannot tell the difference between a false
        memory and a real one.

      <h4>They all look the same: the other-race effect</h4>
      <p>
        The other-race effect is a deficit in the ability to recognize or
        identify a face that is of a different race. You might hear a child say,
        &#x201C;All of the faces look the same,&#x201D; which is common response when looking
        at faces of an unfamiliar or different race. I examine what influences
        the other-race effect and what helps to minimize this effect.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Jill Yamashita</p>
      <h4>A vision for service: At CSUMB, giving back is a core value</h4>
      <p>
        CSUMB has won national acclaim for integrating community service with
        each student&#x2019;s academic experience, and is changing lives &#x2013; and our
        ideas about learning and community &#x2013; in the process
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Seth Pollack</p>
      <h4>Mexican entrepreneurs: a new look to immigration</h4>
      <p>Immigrants aren&#x2019;t always who you think they are.</p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Juan Gutierrez</p>
      <h4>Creating customer loyalty</h4>
      <p>
        John Avella, head of CSUMB&#x2019;s hospitality program, has 40 years of human
        resource development and teaching experience in the hospitality
        industry. He has been vice president of human resources for Marriott
        Corporation, The Rainbow Room and Windows on the World, and president of
        Human Resource Concepts. His work focused on management and executive
        development, Customer service and organizational strategic change. He
        has studied the application of emotional intelligence to customer
        service/loyalty, emotional labor and leadership. He has developed a
        process that teaches people to &#x201C;connect&#x201D; to the customer.

      <p>Presented by Dr. John Avella</p>
      <h4>The region&#x2019;s hospitality industry &#x2013; what&#x2019;s ahead?</h4>
      <p>
        The lingering effects of the recession and looming water problems are
        just two issues facing the local tourism/hospitality industry. What&#x2019;s on
        the horizon?

      <h4>Kinesiology gains in popularity</h4>
      <p>
        Kinesiology &#x2013; the study of human movement &#x2013; is the fastest-growing
        major on campus. As the U.S. population skews older &#x2013; and fatter &#x2013;
        there&#x2019;s a demand for fitness trainers, physical therapists and
        researchers who study the science of movement and performance. Dr. Kent
        Adams, a prolific researcher as well as head of the kinesiology
        department, shares his findings to help people keep fit across the
        lifespan.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Kent Adams</p>
      <h4>Nursing program will meet a need</h4>
      <p>
        The health care industry is coping with the &#x201C;silver tsunami&#x201D; of aging
        baby boomers, combined with the impact of health care reform. Nurses
        will play a big role in meeting both challenges, but will need more than
        a two-year degree to do so. CSUMB has partnered with four community
        colleges in the region to offer a four-year degree that prepares
        them to serve as health care navigators, helping patients manage
        multiple conditions such as hypertension and diabetes outside a hospital
        setting.

      <h4>Unraveling standardized testing and evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        Mark O&#x2019;Shea, a professor education at CSUMB, has been studying the
        standards movement from the perspective of the classroom teacher for
        years. He has conducted extensive clinical research in
        standards-based education and has consulted with school districts
        and state departments of education. He can also talk about the new
        Common Core standards &#x2013; he helped state officials develop the science
        standards &#x2013; and their implementation in California.
      </p>
      <p>Presented by Dr. Mark O&#x2019;Shea</p>
      <h4>Digging through time</h4>
      <p>
        Dr. Ruben Mendoza is an archaeologist, writer, and photographer who has
        explored the length and breadth of Mexico, Central America, Europe, and
        the U.S. Southwest documenting both pre-Columbian and Colonial era
        sites and collections. He has directed major archaeological
        investigations and conservation projects at missions San Juan Bautista,
        Carmel, and Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de la Soledad, among others. Recent efforts
        at the Royal Presidio of Monterey resulted in the tandem discovery of
        the earliest Serra era Christian houses of worship in California dated
        to 1770 and 1771. And he has made astronomically and liturgically
        significant discoveries of solstice, equinox, and feast day solar
        illuminations of mission church altars throughout California, the U.S.
        Southwest, and Mesoamerica.

      <h4>Summer arts</h4>
      <p>
        Sword fights, improvisational comedy, animation, painting: Summer school
        was never this much fun. Several hundred students &#x2013; high school,
        college, and adult members of the local community &#x2013; come to the
        university in July for the annual CSU Summer Arts program. The longtime
        CSU program relocated to CSUMB in the summer of 2012 for a five-year
        run. The program includes a couple of dozen public events, including
        lectures, readings, concerts and theatrical productions &#x2013; in other
        words, the area&#x2019;s summer arts scene has gotten a lot more interesting.

      <h4>CSUMB goes green</h4>
      <p>
        People across campus are working on many fronts to make Cal State
        Monterey Bay a more sustainable university. We developed a Climate
        Action Plan that will provide a road map for eliminating greenhouse gas
        emissions by 2030 and Issues surrounding sustainability are addressed in
        many classes. We&apos;ve also have a robust alternative transportation
        program in place. Mike Lerch, CSUMB&apos;s Manager of Energy and Utilities,
        can speak to the many energy efficiency upgrades on campus (that
        have cut our energy use 20% and reduced our carbon footprint.

      <h4>Art in the service of science</h4>
      <p>
        Science illustration is all around us &#x2013; in books, magazines, posters, on
        websites, in films and TV, and in museums. Most of us don&#x2019;t notice the
        extraordinary technical skill, the precision and carefully observed
        detail, or the beauty of these illustrations because we&#x2019;re busy
        absorbing information from them. CSUMB is home to a nationally renowned
        science illustration program; graduates&#x2019; work is in the Smithsonian
        Institution, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History; in top science
        magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American, Nature and
        Audubon; at the National Zoo, in Washington, D.C., and the Monterey Bay
        Aquarium.
