<p>Each holiday season, the Crime Prevention Officers Association of Monterey County collects toys for children in need throughout the area.</p><p>Again this year, CSUMB’s police department is participating in the toy drive, and reaching out to the campus community for help. Anyone who would like to contribute can bring a new, unwrapped toy to the Police Department &#40;Bldg. 82E&#41; and place it in the barrel located in the lobby.

Toys may be dropped off through Dec. 16 during normal business hours.

Last year’s drive provided more than 1,600 toys to brighten the holiday season for Monterey County youngsters.
