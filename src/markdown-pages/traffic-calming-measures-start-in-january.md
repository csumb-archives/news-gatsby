	 </h4><h3>Traffic calming measures go into effect in January</h3><p>When Inter&#45;Garrison Road opens through to Reservation Road, CSUMB anticipates significant increases in non&#45;campus commuter traffic. In order to address safety concerns, traffic calming measures were implemented during winter break.
</p><p>Work is scheduled to start the week of Jan. 2.
</p><p>These measures will serve to reduce vehicle speeds on main campus, improve bike and pedestrian safety and dissuade non&#45;CSUMB commuters from using main campus roads for short cuts.
</p><p>The measures to be installed include:
</p><p>• Elevated crosswalks with painted markings, primarily on Inter&#45;Garrison Road and Divarty Street. Includes added reflective signage for pedestrian crossings.
</p><p>• Speed lumps on main campus roads, with grooves for bicycle traffic and emergency vehicle access.
</p><p>• Speed humps in parking lot 201.
</p><p>• Removal of six east&#45;westbound stop signs on main campus on Inter&#45;Garrison Road and Divarty Street. • Addition of flashing, solar&#45;powered stop signs in the East Campus area, at Inter&#45;Garrison/Abrams, Inter&#45;Garrison/Schoonover, and Bunker Hill/Abrams intersections. • Radar speed signs with data collection capability along main, high&#45;speed campus entry areas. • Bike and Pedestrian Safety Zone signage. • Non&#45;CSUMB "through traffic" directional routing signage.
