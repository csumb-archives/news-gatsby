<p>Kevin Miller, Dr. Kathy Cruz-Uribe and Dr. Ilene Feinman were honored for their leadership and dedication to the CSU Monterey Bay Vision at the Day of Welcome gathering Aug. 17 in the World Theater.
</p><p>President Dianne Harrison welcomed the campus community back for the fall semester, delivered her annual State of the University address, and then introduced the President’s Medal recipients.
</p><p>Last spring, the university community was invited to make nominations, and then a committee selected finalists for Dr. Harrison’s consideration.
</p><p>The nominees represented a cross-section of campus – some have a long history at the university, others joined more recently; some have direct contact with students, others have an operational focus.
</p><p>Miller, web programming specialist in Information Technology, was the staff recipient of the President’s Medal. His colleagues expressed awe at his ability to solve complex problems, communicate effectively and assert a natural leadership style that is heightened by an affable personality.
</p><p>In the past year, Miller was instrumental in the redesign of the university’s website, including the innovative and cost-effective use of open-source content-management software; the launch of a new mobile site; the continued evolution of the MyCSUMB interface; and online voting tools for the Associated Students election.
</p><p>Dr. Cruz-Uribe, provost and vice president for academic affairs, earned the President’s Medal for administrators. Her colleagues expressed their admiration for someone who applies a rare combination of talents and abilities in dedicated pursuit of continuous improvement for the university.
</p><p>Her leadership played a significant role in the university’s progress in many important areas, including the reaffirmation of the university’s accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC); general education reform, retention and graduation, strategic planning and program review.
</p><p>Dr. Feinman (at right) was awarded the faculty medal. The quality described by her nominators was leadership – the ability to bring people together to solve complex problems, find consensus and make a decision. That leadership includes mentoring – to colleagues and students – and is communicated with humility and humor. As chair of the Faculty Senate, she delivered on her promise to play a hands-on role and participate across campus as the voice of the faculty.
</p><p>Employee service awards were presented to 73 people who have been with the university for five years; 10-year pins were awarded to 28 people; and 37 others were acknowledged for 15 years of service.
</p><p>Frances Payne Adler was awarded emeritus status, a process that involved nomination and approval by faculty members, followed by administrative approvals.
</p><p>Adler, who joined the university in 1996, founded the Creative Writing and Social Action Program. She is a renowned poet.
