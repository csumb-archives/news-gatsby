<p>A tsunami warning is in effect for the Central Coast of California, including Monterey County, following an 8.9-magnitude earthquake off the coast of northern Japan at 9:45 p.m. PST Thursday. Elevated waves were expected to reach the San Francisco Bay Area about 8 a.m.
</p><p>Because of its elevation, **there is no threat to any part of the CSUMB campus. **
</p><p>However, it is important to stay off beaches and avoid other low-lying areas while the warning is in effect. Tsunamis often arrive as a series of waves, which could be dangerous for several hours after the initial wave arrival.
