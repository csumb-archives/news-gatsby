  SEASIDE, Ca., March 29, 2019 -- California Sea Grant has selected 23
  recipients—the largest cohort yet—for its prestigious
  <a
    href="https://caseagrant.ucsd.edu/fellowships/types/state-fellowship"
    target="_blank"
    >State Fellowship</a
  >. This opportunity provides fellows with unparalleled and hands-on training
  at the interface of science, communication, policy and management at either a
  municipal, state or federal host agency in California for one year.
</p>
<p>
  Amongst the 23 fellows announced, 12 were California State University (CSU)
  graduates and two were graduates of CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  “The State Fellowship program is very effective in increasing the capacity of
  host organizations with talent from California universities, while giving
  recent graduates an opportunity to apply their scientific training to policy
  questions,” says Shauna Oh, the newly appointed director of California Sea
  Grant. “Upon completion of their fellowship, many of the fellows remain in
  California’s marine policy and management community and have become leaders,
  making significant contributions to these fields.”
</p>
<p>
  All fellowship recipients have graduate-level training at universities within
  California. This year’s cohort hails from the diverse disciplines of marine
  and watershed science, biology and ecology, marine fisheries biology,
  biodiversity and conservation, resource management, international
  environmental policy, and environmental science and management, while
  representing 15 universities throughout the state.

</p>
<p>
  Anna Holder received a Master of Science in applied marine and watershed
  science from California State University, Monterey Bay in 2018. During
  graduate school, she analyzed survey and fishery catch data to evaluate
  whether and to what extent there is a relationship between environmental and
  demographic factors, and the occurrence of multiple brooding in rockfish (<em
    >Sebastes</em
  >
  spp.)
</p>
<p>
  For her placement at the State Water Resources Control Board in the Office of
  Information Management and Analysis, Holder will combine her science
  communication and data science skills to analyze, interpret, and visualize
  environmental data in a way that is informative for water quality managers and
  the public.

<p><b>Marguerite McCann, Fish and Game Commission:</b></p>
<p>
  Marguerite McCann graduated from California State University, Monterey Bay
  with a master’s in applied marine and watershed science in 2018. She completed
  a professional internship with NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries,
  where she worked on projects relating to education and outreach. She supported
  and participated on a seafloor mapping and exploration mission onboard the R/V
  Nautilus, interpreted the multibeam sonar and remotely-operated vehicle
  imagery for the public, and created a digital outreach product to educate the
  public about deep-sea corals.
</p>
<p>
  McCann’s work with the California Fish and Game Commission will involve
  developing a strategy to address issues relating to invasive red-eared sliders
  and bullfrogs. She will work with stakeholders to ensure this strategy
  addresses the needs of both the ecosystem and the community.
