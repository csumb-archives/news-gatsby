  SEASIDE, Calif., August 28, 2019 -- Two CSUMB
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/marinescience">Marine Science</a> students have
  been selected to receive scholarships from the National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The scholarship recipients, Jezella Peraza
  and Jason Gronich, were the only students selected from across the California
  State University system receive these awards.
</p>
<p>
  Peraza and Gronich will both receive full funding from NOAA to support their
  last two years of academic student at CSUMB and receive funding to conduct
  summer research at NOAA research facilities.
</p>
<p>
  Jezella Peraza received the NOAA Educational Partnership Program with Minority
  Serving Institutions (EPP/MSI) Undergraduate Scholarship. She was one of 11
  students chosen from around the U.S.
</p>
<p>
  "I am humbled and honored to be one of the recipients of the NOAA EPP/MSI
  Scholarship. Receiving the award is so meaningful because it will not only
  help me with financial challenges, it will also provide me the experience I
  need to be successful," said Peraza. "The NOAA undergraduate scholarship
  program will provide me the experience I need to become an accomplished Marine
  Scientist. I can perform research and heighten public awareness by educating
  the public in marine conservation, enhancement of sea habitat and public
  policy, for the continuing benefit of humanity."
</p>
<p>
  Jason Gronich received the NOAA Hollings Scholarship. He was one of 126
  students from around the U.S. selected.
</p>
<p>
  "Applying for the NOAA Hollings scholarship was by far the best decision I
  have made during the three years I have been at CSUMB. Along with the generous
  scholarship that NOAA provides to pay for my tuition, they also are providing
  me with plenty of resources to develop my professional skills and get involved
  with the marine science research I have always dreamed of doing," said
  Gronich. "Achieving this scholarship feels like such a wonderful reward for
  studying so vigorously over the past of couple of years as well as
  volunteering in various marine-related organizations."
