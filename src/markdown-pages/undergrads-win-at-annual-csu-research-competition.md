    >34th Annual California State University (CSU) Student Research
    Competition</a
  >
  on April 24. CSU East Bay hosted this year’s event, which was virtual for the
  first time because of the coronavirus pandemic.
</p>
<p>
  Sarah Ricks, a business administration major and
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/"
    >Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center</a
  >
  (UROC) student, earned first place in the Business, Economics and Public
  Administration category with her presentation, “Social Media Use of Mothers
  from India: Empowering Mother's Spending on Children's Education.”
</p>
<p>
  Selina Espinoza, a psychology major and UROC
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/mcnair-scholars-program/">McNair Scholar</a>,
  placed second in the Health, Nutrition and Clinical Sciences category with
  “Cannabis Use and Perceptions Among Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress
  Disorders.”
</p>
<p>
  The winners were two of
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/uroc/csu-student-research-competition"
    >six undergraduate delegates</a
  >
  selected by the CSUMB Research Scholarship Creative Activity (RSCA) committee
  to participate in the competition. It is held each spring to promote
  excellence in undergraduate and graduate scholarly research and creative
  activity by recognizing outstanding students across the 23 CSU campuses.
</p>
<p>
  “The committee was impressed with the quality of the proposals and the
  enthusiasm demonstrated by the student-mentor relationship. This experience is
  a critical part of the student learning experience and will hopefully inspire
  these students to continue on their journey of research, discovery and
  creative activity,” said Kent Adams, RSCA committee and kinesiology department
  chairperson.

<p><b>Sarah Ricks</b></p>
<p>
  Rick’s research, a collaboration between the
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/iimahmedabad/"
    >Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad</a
  >
  in India and CSUMB, examines the impact of active versus passive social media
  usage on the psychological empowerment of Indian mothers. It analyzed how
  empowerment influences income allocation towards children’s education.
</p>
<p>
  “Increasing spending on children's education can really impact academic
  outcomes, so this research could help India's next-generation improve their
  educational achievement,” Ricks said.
</p>
<p>
  “When I first started in UROC, I knew so little about research I never could
  have imagined that I'd get to this point. I'm so grateful for UROC and
  especially my mentor, Dr. Jenny Lin, who has helped me significantly along the
  way.”
</p>
<p>
  An assistant professor in the College of Business, Lin said the award for
  Rick’s research “challenges a perception that business is only about making
  profits.”
</p>
<p>
  “There is also another side of business and marketing that is often
  overlooked, and that is how business CAN do good. The type of research we
  conduct brings in those lenses where marketing research could be advocates for
  consumers, could better understand the needs and behaviors of consumers, so
  that businesses can better tailor to them in ways that advance the well-being
  of consumers,” Lin said.
</p>
<p>
  She encouraged students and her colleagues to take on undergraduate research.
</p>
<p>
  “Undergraduate research should not be overlooked. This is where student
  researchers start their journey of lifelong learning. I hope that this opens
  eyes for undergraduate students, especially those studying business, that
  graduate school is a path,” Lin said.
</p>
<p>
  “For colleagues that are still skeptical about involving undergraduate
  students in their research: Indeed, it is not easy. … But when interested
  students come by, open the door and give them the opportunity. They might
  surprise you.”
</p>
<p>
  The co-owner of a local business, Ricks plans to apply to a marketing research
  graduate program that integrates statistics, data science and psychology. She
  is also a parent who has followed her mother’s example by pursuing higher
  education.
</p>

  >My mom went back to school when I was a kid, and I got to watch her walk at
  graduation. And it feels like things have come full circle, now that I'll be
  graduating in a few weeks and my kids will get to see me (eventually) walk at
  my own graduation ceremony,” she said.
</p>
<p><b>Selina Espinoza</b></p>
<p>
  Espinoza’s research, part of a summer research experience led by Kent
  Hutchison and Raeghan Mueller at the
  <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/center/cuchange/"
    >Colorado University, Center for Health and Neuroscience, Genes, and
    Environment lab</a
  >, provides insight into veterans' experience with cannabis and the
  therapeutic implications it has on their post-traumatic stress disorder
  symptoms.
</p>
<p>
  “This award validates Selina's work and demonstrates that cannabis research
  can be respected and appreciated in the fields of health and social science,”
  said Jennifer Lovell, Espinoza’s faculty mentor and an assistant professor of
  psychology.
</p>
<p>
  “It has given her extra motivation to continue this path for research and
  graduate study, and it is a timely topic for advocacy around the therapeutic
  use of cannabis."
</p>
<p>
  After graduation in the fall, Selina plans to pursue a doctorate in health or
  clinical psychology with the goal of becoming a psychology professor with her
  own cannabis research lab.
</p>
<p>
  Espinoza said the award is special to her because it proves cannabis research
  is supported, and students like herself, who identify as low-income and
  first-generation, can thrive in higher education.
</p>
<p>
  “I’m grateful for the experience as it was an amazing opportunity to learn,
  grow, and inspire. I would definitely recommend this competition to others
  because it's a great learning experience,” Espinoza said.
</p>
<p>
  “This competition is an amazing platform to share your research with a large
  academic audience. Research is a beautiful and transformative craft that
  should be shared with the public in a manner in which they can comprehend it.”
