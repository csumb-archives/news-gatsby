<p>National Undergraduate Research Week takes place April 14 through 18.
</p><p>At CSU Monterey Bay, it’s an annual celebration of research and creative activity. Undergraduates can explore the opportunities available to them and find ways to get involved.
</p><p>Three participants in the university’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (known as UROC) have planned several events to encourage students to do just that.
</p><p>Those events – organized by Molly Fredle, Alexis Ingram and Andrea Valdez – include talks, a poster session and an open house and mixer. All of them will take place at the UROC office, Suite 2150 in the Tanimura &amp; Antle Family Memorial Library.
</p><p>• April 14, noon to 1:30 p.m., researcher talks. Students are invited to learn how research can benefit them. Topics to be presented by fellow students include how to get involved, the research experience and how it prepares them for graduate school.
</p><p>• April 15, 2 to 3:30 p.m., poster session. From sharks to methamphetamine use to aging, the variety of research being conducted by CSUMB students will be on display.
</p><p>• April 16, 2 to 3:30 p.m., research group open house and mixer. UROC scholars and their mentors will be available to talk about the opportunities available on campus.
</p><p>The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center at CSUMB was established in 2009. With training and support from UROC, students work on innovative research projects on campus and at other research institutions. 
</p><p>“Undergraduate research engages students at the highest scholarly levels by linking research, learning and mentorship to real world experiences,” said Dr. William Head, director of UROC. “This translates to long-term academic success, self-confidence and persistence and has career benefits.” <a href="http://uroc.csumb.edu">Learn more about UROC</a>.
