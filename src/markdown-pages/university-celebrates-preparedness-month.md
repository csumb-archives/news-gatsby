<p>CSU Monterey Bay will host two events for community members to mark National Preparedness Month, an annual campaign that encourages people to prepare their families, schools, businesses and communities to deal with disasters.
</p><p>This represents the ninth year the Federal Emergency Management Agency has observed NPM. This year’s theme is Resolve to be Ready.
</p><p>“CSUMB wants to help everyone be better prepared for the emergencies that will inevitably impact our area,” said Dick Bower, the university’s emergency manager. “We’re working closely with our neighbors in Seaside, Marina and Monterey County to bring emergency preparedness to a high level in our area. We invite community members to join us.”
</p><p>An emergency preparedness fair will take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sept. 14, on the campus quad. Information booths will be staffed by emergency management organizations. Demonstrations will cover disaster and medical triage, how to use a fire extinguisher, and use of search dogs. Presentations will cover public health threats, individual and neighborhood preparedness and volunteer opportunities. Emergency vehicles will be on display.
</p><p>Among the participating organizations are Presidio of Monterey Fire Department and emergency management office; Seaside fire and police departments; Monterey County’s Office of Emergency Services and Health Department; National Weather Service; and the American Red Cross.
</p><p>CSUMB will kick off creation of its federally registered Community Emergency Response Team – CERT – with a training course Sept. 28-30 in the university’s Emergency Operations Center.
</p><p>The CERT program trains community members to assist each other and first responders in emergencies. Subjects covered include disaster preparedness, fire safety, disaster medical operations, light search and rescue, disaster psychology and the CERT role in terrorism response. At the end of the training, a simulation will be held on campus.
</p><p>To register for the CERT training or for more information, contact Bower at 582-3589.
</p><p>Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/map">here</a>. Campus visitors must purchase a parking pass from machines located on the parking lots.
