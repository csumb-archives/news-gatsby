<p>CSU Monterey Bay's online MBA program is now offering a second track for students without extensive management experience.
</p><p>The new track began in January as a pilot program and will now become an ongoing program with a full cohort of students. The curriculum mirrors the university’s original online MBA program, with a focus on global business, corporate leadership and technology, but includes more case studies for less experienced students to analyze and discuss. Aspiring leaders can now access the same dynamic learning opportunities as experienced executives, gaining essential knowledge, marketable skills and an expanded network as they hone their business acumen.
</p><p>The university will continue to offer its acclaimed online MBA program on a track for experienced executives. Since the program launched in 2009, participants have appreciated the opportunity to learn with fellow professionals who can contribute their own experiences to high-level discussions, challenging assignments and “real-time” case studies. Students stay with the same group, or cohort, throughout the two-year program, getting to know one another, gaining mutual respect and building career networks.
</p><p>“It is exciting to add a new track to our online MBA that allows a broader audience to be able to take advantage of this innovative education,” said Chris Hasegawa, dean of Extended Education and International Programs. “When students graduate, they are ready to move to the next step of their career armed with the knowledge and tools necessary for success.”
</p><p>The online MBA program is a selective, fixed-curriculum, graduate business program. Classes are developed to create a technology-rich learning experience delivered exclusively online, allowing access from around the globe. Students complete eight courses over the two years: one course at a time, for eight weeks, four times per year.
</p><p>Interested candidates should call 866-757-5172 or visit MBA.csumb.edu to learn more and start the application process. A supportive advisement team is ready to assist candidates from the beginning of the application process through to graduation.
