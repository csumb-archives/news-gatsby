<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>CSU Monterey Bay’s mobile website, launched in June 2011, has won a top honor among universities, colleges and independent schools in the western United States.
</p><p>The Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) awarded CSUMB a gold in its Awards of Excellence competition in the individual sub-website category. CSUMB beat out Stanford University’s School of Medicine and California State University’s 50th anniversary website for the top honor.
</p><p>This story was published in June 2011, when the site was launched:

</p><p>Want a CSU Monterey Bay map and campus tour, university news and sports results at your fingertips?
</p><p>There’s a web app for that. CSUMB has just launched a mobile version of its website – complete with news, sports, event listings and dining hall hours – that can be accessed <a href="http://csumb.edu/mobile">here</a>. It’s simpler, faster and formatted for smaller screens. The mobile website is accessible via devices such as iPhone, Blackberry and Android-based smart phones and tablets using the devices’ built-in web browser. It includes tools designed to help the community as well as students, faculty and staff navigate campus information. Students find it especially useful since it allows them to check their class schedule and campus accounts, access the bus schedule and renew library books. Because a growing number of people – on and off campus – are accessing the web via handheld devices, CSUMB President Dianne Harrison thought it was essential to provide information in a format that would accommodate those users. CSUMB is now among the 9 percent of American colleges and universities that have mobile websites, according to the Mobile in Higher Education website. (Read the survey <a href="http://www.dmolsen.com/mobile-in-higher-ed/2011/02/01/results-from-higher-ed-mobile-website-tech-survey/">here</a>.) The mobile site was developed in-house by Kevin Miller and Greg Pool of the university’s Information Technology staff, with help from several students majoring in computer science, and Liz MacDonald and Kevin Garcia of the communications staff. It follows on the redesign and relaunch of the university's website, csumb.edu, in October 2010.
