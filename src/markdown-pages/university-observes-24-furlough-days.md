</p><p>To reduce costs as a result of state budget cuts, CSU Monterey Bay will have 24 unpaid furlough days over the 2009-10 fiscal year.
</p><p>The furloughs will result in a 9.23 percent reduction in pay for university employees. It is one of several steps being taken across the California State University system to close a $564 million budget gap for the 2009-10 fiscal year.
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay President Dianne F. Harrison has directed that furloughs be guided by three basic principles: first, to protect the quality of the student experience, both in and out of the classroom; second, to minimize the impact on employees; and third, to support CSUMB's continued development as a comprehensive university.
</p><p>Two furlough days will be observed each month, except for March, when four days will be observed during spring break. The days are divided into two categories: six state budget closure days and 18 administrative furlough days.
</p><p>On the closure days, administrative offices and the library will close, and classes will not be held. Sworn police officers will be on duty, campus dining services will be open, Residential Life staff will support student housing and the fitness center will be open. On administrative furlough days, offices will close, but classes will be held and the library will remain open with limited services. Police, dining and housing services and the fitness center will remain open.
