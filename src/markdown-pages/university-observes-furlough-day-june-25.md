</p><p>California State University, Monterey Bay will observe the final administrative furlough day of fiscal year 2009-10 on Friday, June 25. The university is observing furlough days to reduce costs as a result of state budget cuts<strong>.</strong>
</p><p>CSU Monterey Bay will have a total of 24 unpaid furlough days over the 2009-10 fiscal year, with a corresponding 9.23 percent reduction in pay for its employees. It is one of several steps being taken across the California State University system to close a $564 million budget gap for the 2009-10 fiscal year. The furlough days started on Aug. 7.
</p><p>University President Dianne F. Harrison has directed that furloughs be guided by three basic principles: first, to protect the quality of the student experience, both in and out of the classroom; second, to minimize the impact on employees; and third, to support CSUMB's continued development as a comprehensive university.
</p><p>There were two furlough days each month, except for March, when four days were observed during spring break.
</p><p>The days are divided into two categories: six state budget closure days and 18 administrative furlough days.
</p><p>On the <strong>closure</strong> days, administrative offices and the library will close, and classes will not be held. Sworn police officers will be on duty, campus dining services will be open, Residential Life staff will support student housing and the fitness center will be open. On <strong>administrative furlough</strong> days, administrative offices will close, but classes will be held and the library will remain open with limited services. Police, dining and housing services and the fitness center will remain open.
</p><p>Administrative furlough dates are designated as A and state budget closure days are designated as C:
