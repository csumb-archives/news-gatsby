<p>CSU Monterey Bay’s School of Business and the local Small Business Development Centers are about to begin work on a project to improve the economic vitality of Castroville.
</p><p>Monterey County’s Redevelopment Agency has contracted with the university and its small business development center for work on the Castroville Commercial Improvement Project.
</p><p>The first stage involves surveying residents and businesses. Dr. Murray Millson, professor of marketing at CSUMB, has designed a pair of surveys that will be carried out by university students beginning Feb. 12. The surveys are designed to identify residents’ shopping behavior, and find out what would encourage them to shop locally. Then, business owners will be surveyed to see what they identify as opportunities for improvement and as barriers to their success.
</p><p>The university’s survey efforts will link with the Monterey County Office of Employment Training, which has already interviewed several businesses in Castroville about staffing needs.
</p><p>Using information from the surveys and interviews, the SBDC will determine what services would be helpful and assist business owners in accessing those services. In addition, one-on-one private counseling will be provided by the Central Coast Small Business Development Center at Cabrillo College.
</p><p>Meanwhile, CSUMB’s Small Business Development Center will work with three anchor businesses in the community, helping to define a market niche and maximizing tourism. This effort is intended to increase the number of potential customers for all retail shops in downtown Castroville.
</p><p>Another part of the project involves gauging the success of a culinary academy in the area.
</p><p>“The Small Business Development Center normally focuses on individual businesses,” said Andrea Nield, associate director of the center based at CSUMB. “This project involves a community development research role for the university. The collaboration will yield better results for the community.”
</p><p>The project is scheduled to be finished in June.
