  Cesar Velazquez, coordinator of Cal State Monterey Bay’s Upward Bound program,
  has been honored by his peers in the Western Association of Educational
  Opportunity Personnel.
</p>
<p>
  The Steve Holeman Award, presented to Velazquez at the association’s annual
  conference in April, honors the memory of one of its founders. It recognizes a
  director’s dedication to educational excellence and equity, concern for
  developing students’ potential and professionalism in administration.

  "It's a great honor to receive this award, especially because so many of my
  past mentors and Upward Bound staff and alums contributed to the nomination,"
  he said. Velazquez has been coordinator of the Upward Bound program at CSUMB
  since its inception in 2000. The program assists low&#45;income,
  first&#45;generation students to further their education beyond high school.
  During the school year, the students receive tutoring, academic advising,
  college and career exploration and financial aid mentoring from Upward Bound
  staff members during school visits. During the six&#45;week summer session,
  the students live in CSUMB residence halls and participate in academic,
  social, recreational and cultural activities. The CSUMB program serves
  students attending Watsonville, Soledad, Pajaro Valley and North Monterey
  County high schools. About 97 percent of participants go on to enroll in
  college. In nominating Velazquez for the award, former Upward Bound
  participants and colleagues emphasized his concern for students as well as his
  willingness to serve as a mentor and role model:

  Velazquez grew up in the Salinas Valley and worked in the fields before
  attending Hartnell College and transferring to CSUMB. His entire professional
  career has been spent working in TRiO programs.

  "I'm most proud of serving in the programs that guided me toward college,
  especially because I'm a Talent Search TRiO alum," Velazquez said.
