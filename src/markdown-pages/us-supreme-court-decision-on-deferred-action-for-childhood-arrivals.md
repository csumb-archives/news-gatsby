    Monterey Bay on June 18, 2020</i

<p>
  I was delighted to see the Supreme Court’s decision today. Chancellor White
  spoke for all of us in the CSU community when he said in his statement today:
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >"The decision by the Supreme Court of the United States to reject the
    rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is a
    truly outstanding and welcome outcome, especially for the nearly 700,000
    DACA recipients nationwide, including thousands of students and employees of
    the California State University (CSU)."</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >"Some of the CSU’s brightest students and most dedicated employees are
    Dreamers and they are found on each of our 23 campuses. They, like their
    peers, seek a better life for themselves and their families, and they
    powerfully contribute to the strength of the university and their own
    communities through service and leadership."</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  Many of these Dreamers are our students. This decision allows CSUMB to
  continue to provide them with access to education and state financial aid.
  Dreamers are an important part of the population we serve and we remain
  steadfast in our belief that Congress should take swift, bipartisan action to
  help these members of our community continue their contributions to our
  region, state, and nation.
