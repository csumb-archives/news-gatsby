<p>Of all the parts of a woman's body, none is quite as shrouded in mystery as the vagina.
</p><p>The very word is rarely spoken aloud; it is confined to hushed tones and furtive glances, a word to be vaguely embarrassed by. This will not be the case at the World Theater Feb. 4, 5 and 6, though, where that most private part finds itself thrust into the spotlight in "The Vagina Monologues."
</p><p>The play has received rave reviews in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. Written by Eve Ensler, the "Vagina Monologues" tells the stories of a variety of women, their connections with each other and with the world. CSUMB's production is student-run, student-directed and features student actors.
</p><p>The funny, serious and enlightening play explores new and interesting viewpoints for both men and women.
</p><p>The play's staging at CSUMB is part of this year's V-Day campaign. V-Day's mission: to celebrate women and girls and to stop the sexual violence being perpetrated against them all over the world. V-Day has raised millions of dollars since it started 11 years ago and has been named one of Worth Magazine's "100 Best Charities."
</p><p>V-Day has grown exponentially, from an underground feminist event to a mainstream media one. Benefit performances are scheduled around the world in connection with Valentine's Day. The CSUMB production is put on by EMPOWER, a student organization that educates the community about ending violence against women. EMPOWER will donate a portion of the proceeds to local organizations working to do just that. 
</p><p>This year's production will feature new monologues. Parents, please note the mature content and adult themes of the play.
