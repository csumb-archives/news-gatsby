<h2>Otter community staying connected during shelter-at-home order</h2>

<p>
  California State University, Monterey Bay moved to limited campus operations
  on March 17 to comply with government orders to slow the spread of COVID-19.
  While forced to be apart, the Otter community has created a “virtual raft”
  allowing us to stay connected during shelter at home.
</p>
<p>
  The concept relates to the behavior of sea otters in the wild. They form
  “rafts” by linking themselves together with their paws and kelp to remain
  connected and protected while floating in the water.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/communications/">University Communications</a>
  launched a social media campaign inviting the CSUMB community to post photos
  and videos of themselves working and playing from home tagged with
  “#VirtualRaft.” To see the posts, check CSUMB’s social media accounts on
  Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

  <a href="https://csumb.edu/psychology/">Department of Psychology</a> and
  <a href="https://otterathletics.com/">Otter Athletics</a> released video
  messages in the days just after the campus closure to express sympathy, offer
  advice and encourage students and the CSUMB community.
</p>
<p>
  “This pandemic really has, I think, driven home the fact that we are all an
  interconnected human family, and I think it’s also bringing out the best in
  many of us. I’m very proud and humbled and heartened by how the Otter
  community has responded to this unprecedented situation,” Ochoa said in his
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljEBx4QuL-o&amp;feature=youtu.be"
    >video message</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  “Know that I am with you. We will get through this together. I know that the
  Otter community will continue to respond as it has so far and, we will come
  out of this eventually. We will go back, we will be stronger.”
</p>
<p>
  CSUMB’s
  <a href="https://youtu.be/sGfFuiCPybQ">psychology department video</a> was one
  of the first to reach out to students and address the campus closures in the
  California State University (CSU) system. The CSU shared the video on its
  official social media platforms.
</p>
<p>
  The video featured several faculty and staff speaking from their homes in
  clips edited together to say, in part: “We wanted to make you a little video,
  to let you know that we’re thinking about you. We know this isn’t what you
  signed up for when you signed up for this semester. We weren’t expecting it
  either, but we’ll get through it together!”
</p>
<p>
  The four-minute message also informed students that campus resources such as
  academic advising and counseling with the
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/pgcc/">Personal Growth &amp; Counseling Center</a>
  were still available online and by phone.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://otterathletics.com/">Otter Athletics</a> coaches offered a

  to team members and the entire Otter community.
</p>
<p>
  “I want to encourage all of you, and all of us, to continue to lead with love,
  support and compassion for everyone, especially your teammates and coaches and
  your faculty at CSUMB,” Athletics Director Kirby Garry said.
</p>
<p>
  “Over the next however many weeks or months that this takes to get through,
  we’re in it together. (We should) continue to work with and for each other,
  and again, position ourselves for success. Now, every day and into the
  future.”

<p><b>Virtual Programming</b></p>
<p>
  The Otter Student Union (OSU) is leading the way in launching a variety of
  online and virtual activities and events including a poetry slam, live
  concerts, trivia nights and a lecture about pandemics.
</p>
<p>
  The lecture featured Dr. Karina Levina, author of the book, “Pandemics &amp;
  the Media.” She spoke in a videoconference format that attracted the most
  participants of any OSU virtual event so far with about 60 in attendance.
</p>
<p>
  OSU scrapped all the programs they originally had planned for the rest of the
  year, because it required in-person attendance.
</p>
<p>
  “We had to pivot to thinking about different ways we can engage folks online
  with scheduled programs like our trivia night, to doing more impromptu things
  that would appeal to different audiences,” said Michelle Czarnecki, OSU
  assistant director of programs and communication.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to thinking creatively, OSU staff acted quickly to provide
  resources to connect not only students, but the entire CSUMB community. They
  are also meeting with other CSUMB departments including
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/hws">Health and Wellness Services</a> to partner on
  virtual programming.
</p>
<p>
  “We know this is an incredibly stressful time. We want to provide that
  opportunity for people to continue to get together and engage on both fun
  topics as well as more serious topics related to what’s going on in the world
  around them, which is consistent with our mission,” OSU Director Chelsea
  Buffington said.
</p>
<p>
  Information about OSU’s virtual programming — in addition to recommendations
  from OSU staff for entertainment and other resources available online — can be
  found on the <a href="https://csumb.edu/osu">OSU website</a> and social media.
