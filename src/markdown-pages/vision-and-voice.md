</p><h3>Photographer, Global health researcher to give presentations</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay alumnus Daniel Jack Lyons will visit campus Nov. 18 and 19 for a pair of presentations on his current work.
</p><p>Lyons, a 2004 graduate with a degree in Social and Behavioral Sciences, earned a masterâ€™s degree in public health from Columbia University before launching a career as a photographer and global health research consultant.
</p><p>In his human rights and public health work, he employs a technique called photovoice, which combines photography with grassroots social action. Participants in his projects are asked to represent their community or point of view by taking photos, discussing them as a group and then developing narratives to go with the photos. The projects provide insight into how people experience human rights abuses and public health issues and help them understand their circumstances and define their hopes for the future.
</p><p>On his website, Lyons explained that he also uses photographs and reporting to document the process as well as the lives of participants in his work. Lyons &#40;at left&#41; has held positions and consulted as a researcher for the Foundation for AIDS Research, Columbia University, the United Nations, PCI Media Impact and Vanderbilt University. His work has been published on the Huffington Post website as well as in academic journals such as Culture, Health and Sexuality. He lives in New York City.
