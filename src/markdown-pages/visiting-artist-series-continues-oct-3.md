<h3>Curator inspires dialogue on issues of social concern</h3><p>CSU Monterey Bay’s visiting artist series continues Oct. 3 when San Francisco Bay Area curator, critic and educator Anuradha Vikram visits campus.
</p><p>Her presentation will get under way at 6 p.m. in the University Center living room.
</p><p>Vikram has curated exhibitions for the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, Mills College Art Museum in Oakland, the DeYoung Museum Artist Studio in San Francisco and, until recently, served as curator of the Worth Ryder Art Gallery for UC Berkeley’s Department of Art Practice.
</p><p>For nearly a decade, she has made exhibitions and programs that bridge institutional spaces with other spaces of culture and public life. As a curator of interdisciplinary exhibitions and public programs, she collaborates with artists to inspire dialogue on issues of social concern and to inform space with tangible evidence of the charged relationships between people.
</p><p>She has developed programming that fosters interaction between artists and members of the public, including experts in environmental, legal, technological, scientific and civic areas, as well as general audiences.
</p><p>Through these strategies, she engages audiences at every level of art education with the ideas and formal concepts that shape the art of our times.
</p><p>The University Center is located on Sixth Avenue at B Street. Driving directions and a campus map are available <a href="http://csumb.edu/maps">here</a>.
