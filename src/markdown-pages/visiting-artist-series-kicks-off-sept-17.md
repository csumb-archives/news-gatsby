<p>CSU Monterey Bayâ€™s visiting artist series kicks off Sept. 17 when Los Angeles artists Karla Diaz and Mario Ybarra Jr. visit campus.
</p><p>Their presentation will get under way at 6 p.m. in Visual and Public Art Building 72 on Inter-Garrison Road at Fifth Avenue. The presentation is free and open to the public.
</p><p>In 2002, Ybarra and Diaz founded Slanguage Studio in Wilmington, the port district of Los Angeles, Slanguage began modestly as an expanded studio providing work space for the artists as well as an open space for the community to draw, sculpt, dance or just tell stories and hang out. Before it closed earlier this year, Slanguage Studio had evolved into a gallery, a site for workshops and events, as well as a residency that brought in other artists.
</p><p>Ybarra and Diaz have been in the forefront of many pilot events, exhibition and programs across the globe. Their work has been presented by the Whitney Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Tate Modern in London, Chicago Hyde Park Center, ARCO Fair in Madrid and was included in the first Made in LA Biennial.
