<p>“The whole Mission neighborhood is a massive public artwork, both sacred and profane.” – Carlos Santana
</p><p>The Visual and Public Art Department will kick off this semester's Visiting Artists Lecture Series on Sept. 22 with a presentation by Annice Jacoby, editor of "Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo."
</p><p>The lecture will start at 6 p.m. in the Alumni and Visitors Center, located on the corner of Gen. Jim Moore Boulevard and Inter-Garrison Road.
</p><p>Starting in the early 1970s, a provocative new street art scene transformed San Francisco’s Mission District into an art epicenter that crosses popular culture, fine art and political audiences. “Mission Muralismo” is a movement of accomplished street art combining elements of Mexican mural painting, surrealism, pop art, urban punk, eco-warrior, cartoon and guerilla graffiti that has catapulted many San Francisco artists into the international spotlight.
</p><p>The Mission District is home to the largest concentration in the world of public painting that embodies activism, culture, passion and desire for social change. "Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo" showcases these vibrant works in hundreds of color photographs, with commentary by the artists who produced them and Mission-savvy writers including a foreword by Grammy Award winner Carlos Santana.
</p><p>Jacoby has produced innovative public art projects incorporating visual arts, literature, theater and media. She has served as director of performing arts public events at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and director of public relations at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Her work includes launching City of Poets for the San Francisco Public Library; The Roof Is on Fire, No Blood, No Foul, multimedia community performances with youth, police, and national media, in collaboration with the California College of the Arts and the City of Oakland; The Fort Point Project, in collaboration with the United Nations, a multimedia site-specific performance; and Watershed &amp; River of Words, national environmental programs with Poet Laureate Robert Hass.
