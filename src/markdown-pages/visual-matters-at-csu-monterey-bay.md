</p><p>In order to graduate, CSU Monterey Bay students in the Visual and Public Art Department create a capstone project â€“ a sort of senior thesis of art. Mounted together, they form an exhibit open to the public.
</p><p>The capstone projects are the final capping of skills, knowledge, values and commitments of the individual students. In these projects, student artists have identified public themes and critical issues that are relevant to themselves and their audience.
</p><p>This year's exhibit, dubbed <em>Visual Matters</em>, gathers 18 works in a show of creative force. The exhibit will open on Monday, May 10, with an artists' reception from 5 to 7 p.m. in the Visual and Public Art Building (Bldg. 71). The public is invited.
</p><p>For an online exhibit catalog, visit vpa.csumb.edu.
</p><p>The work will be on display until the final capstone and medal ceremony, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Friday, May 21. The public is invited to this free event or to view the exhibit on weekdays during normal business hours. Driving directions and a campus map are available at csumb.edu/map.
</p><p>The campuswide Capstone Festival will take place Thursday and Friday, May 20 and 21. For a schedule of capstone presentations in all academic departments, visit csumb.edu/capstone.**
