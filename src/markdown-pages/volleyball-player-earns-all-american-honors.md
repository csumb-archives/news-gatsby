<p>Rheann Fall, outside hitter on CSUMB's volleyball team,  is the first Otter athlete to earn All-American honors in any sport.
</p><p>Fall was selected to the Daktronics All-American first team on Dec. 2.
</p><p>"Cal State Monterey Bay is very proud of Rheann,” said Director of Athletics Vince Otoupal.  “Her work in the classroom and on the court is impressive and we want to thank Daktronics for recognizing this and awarding Rheann this wonderful honor. She has earned it. She is a wonderful teammate and helped lead the team to record heights this year.”
</p><p>It was the second national honor to come her way recently. Earlier in the week, she was named to the the American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American honorable mention team. That's in addition to  her selection to the All-California Collegiate Athletic Association first team.
</p><p>Fall was the CCAA’s leader in kills and finished the season seventh in the nation in points and kills. She recorded 16 double-doubles (kills-digs) and had 20 or more kills 11 times. She also had two matches of 20 or more digs this season.
</p><p>She was named a Sport Import/AVCA National Player of the Week and CCAA Player of the Week after leading CSUMB to two victories over nationally ranked teams.
</p><p>“Coach Garry's approach over the last three years has been consistent and this year has paid off, for Rheann and the team,” Otoupal said.
</p><p>“CSUMB volleyball set records this year. I'm honored to have Rheann as a member of Otter athletics; she is one of those student-athletes who make people around her better."
