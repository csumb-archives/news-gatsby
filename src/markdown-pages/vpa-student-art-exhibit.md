<h4>Show runs through Feb. 1</h4><p>Two exhibitions will open in the art gallery at California State University, Monterey Bay on Dec. 4 with a reception for the artists from 3 to 4 p.m. that day.
</p><p>"Invoke: A Project to Invite Memory and Forgiveness" is a collaboration of the digital public art class. The show features the documentation of eight site-specific art "interventions" responding to memory and forgiveness. These interventions took place in public spaces on Nov. 1 in observance of Day of the Dead.
</p><p>The second show, "Community-Based Art: Social Change in Motion," is the capstone project of Jessica Street. By looking at the work being done in South Africa with HIV/AIDS patients, the power that comes from the merging of creativity and community becomes obvious.
</p><p>Students in the university's museum studies program curated the exhibit, which is on display in the Balfour/Brutzman Gallery in Bldg. 71 on the CSUMB campus. Hours are Thursday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Friday noon to 3 p.m. Parking is available in lot 71 off Sixth Avenue. Please note that the gallery will be closed Dec. 14 through Jan. 20 for winter break.
