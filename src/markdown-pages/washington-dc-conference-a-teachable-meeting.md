<p>“Unique Event Management Opportunity” read the flyer. “Unique” may be an understatement.
</p><p>The flyer was recruiting hospitality students to help staff the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual policy conference in Washington, D.C., March 20&#45;22. More than 16,000 people are expected to attend.
</p><p>To help with such a big conference, Precision Meetings and Events, an Alexandria, Va.&#45;based company, recruited approximately 250 students from across the country. Ashley Williams and Caitlyn Cinelli, seniors in Cal State Monterey Bay’s sustainable hospitality program, applied, were interviewed and accepted. Business administration major Katie McKoane – who has taken a number of hospitality management courses – was also selected.

Their travel expenses, food and lodging are covered by Precision and they receive an honorarium for their efforts. They attend a daylong orientation on the Saturday before the conference starts.

If past years are a guide, the students will work 16&#45;hour days setting up, giving directions, managing crowd control and doing whatever else needs to be done.

How important is the conference? Vice President Joe Biden is among the speakers.
</p><p>Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich are also speaking.
