<h3>Student capstones on display at Steinbeck Center</h3><p>While most capstone projects are displayed during the end-of-semester campus-wide festival at Cal State Monterey Bay, for years a few have been exhibited at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.
</p><p>This year, the center showcased the work of three Visual and Public Art students, two Human Communication students and an Integrated Studies major who combined art and psychology.
</p><p>“The students conceptualize, design, create and install their work for public viewing,” said Deborah Silguero, curator of exhibitions and collections and a lecturer in CSUMB’s museum studies program. “This is their first time presenting in a museum setting.”
</p><p>The exhibit, “We See It This Way,” opened in conjunction with the annual Steinbeck Festival in early May. It will remain on display through June.
</p><p>Visual and Public Art student Kirsten Brown’s curatorial project, “Creativity in Camouflage: Soldier Art and the Matter of Morale,” represents a connection between the Central Coast’s art and military histories and provides a look at military training from a psychological point of view.
</p><p>Vietnam-era soldiers in Fort Ord’s arts and crafts program created the artwork in her exhibit. Most of the artists are unknown.
</p><p>Other capstones in the exhibit include:
</p><p>• Stacey Limone (VPA), Light Alchemy: Photographic Representations of Spiritual Transformation
</p><p>• Emily Thompson (Integrated Studies), Things Concealed: Art as Therapy
</p><p>• Alyssa Thompson (VPA), Salinas: What’s the Object?
</p><p>• Sarah Hollingsworth and Veronica Griffith (HCom), Oral Histories of Chinatown: Embracing the Street
</p><p>Photographs by Monterey Peninsula College student Patrick Russo are also included in the exhibit.
</p><p>“I see the students go from being somewhat overwhelmed with anxiety to overjoyed with personal success,” Silguero said.
</p><p>“I’m proud to say that many of these students go successfully off to work in the museum field, education and art.”
