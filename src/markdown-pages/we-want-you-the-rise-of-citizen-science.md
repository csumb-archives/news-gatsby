<p>The annual Sanctuary Currents Symposium brings scientists, managers, students and the public together to address important issues involving the Monterey Bay and beyond. This year’s event, scheduled for April 25 at Cal State Monterey Bay, will examine citizen science.</p><p>Management of the marine environment is only as good as the quality &#40;and quantity&#41; of the monitoring data that support it. Traditionally, monitoring of the marine environment was left to academic and government scientists. With the proliferation of environmental problems, increased awareness by the public and the decrease in financial support for monitoring at the state and federal levels, the role of citizen scientists is on the rise.
</p><p>The public is invited to attend a day of lively presentations and discussions about what it means to be a citizen scientist, programs focused primarily on education and those modeled closely on formal monitoring efforts. Research posters will be on display throughout the day. The day concludes with the Ricketts Memorial Lecture at 2:30 p.m.
</p><p>Registration for the free event starts at 8 a.m., with the first presentation scheduled for 9:15. All activities will be held in the University Center on the CSUMB campus.

Parking is free.
</p><p>Sponsors include CSUMB and its Institute for Applied Marine Ecology; NOAA and the National Marine Sanctuaries; the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and Save the Earth.
</p><p>"We are excited by the opportunity to discuss the many dimensions of citizen science in a public venue like the Currents Symposium," said Dr. James Lindholm, the James W. Rote Distinguished Professor of Marine Science and Policy at CSUMB<strong>.</strong>
</p><p>"While exhibit tables will offer many groups the opportunity to sign up participants for their activities, with our five speakers we strove to cover more broadly the different types of citizen science, ranging from education&#45;based to more research&#45;based. We hope to have a lively discussion."
