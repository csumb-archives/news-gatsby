<p><strong>Blog evolves into CSUMB student's Project: Market Me</strong> Cathryn "Cat" Sampson isn't shy about contacting CEOs and best-selling authors. Sampson has been getting replies, not for her own job search, but for her website which offers help for others in their career search. Sampson, who found time to set up the website despite a 22-unit load at CSUMB, isn't doing it for a class project or for money, although she has received three job offers. â€“ Monterey Herald, May 21, 2011
