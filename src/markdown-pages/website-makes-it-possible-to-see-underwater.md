</p><p>Through a partnership between CSUMB and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, it's now possible to see what's going on beneath the cold waters of the bay via the web.
</p><p>The Sanctuary Characterization &amp; Image Display or SCID allows students, scientists and members of the public to study the sanctuary seafloor without leaving their dorm room, office or home.
</p><p>"The idea is to see what's there and what's going on," said Dr. James Lindholm, director of CSUMB's Institute for Applied Marine Ecology (IfAME).
</p><p>An underwater camera captures photo and video of the fish and other creatures that live within the sanctuary's boundaries. Those images are uploaded to a database accessible at the SCID website.
</p><p>Visitors to the <a href="http://sep.csumb.edu/ifame/scid">site </a>can choose from more than 1,000 Google markers on the sanctuary map; they can then choose to view photos or video. Should they choose video, a short YouTube video pops up when a marker is clicked, revealing what's underneath. According to Dr. Lindholm, the deepest area captured on video was nearly a quarter mile down.
</p><p>"Our goal is to make it easier for people to get a sense of what the bottom looks like," Dr. Lindholm said.
</p><p>One graduate student is using the site to look at a link between types of fish and seafloor features inside a marine protected area in the southern part of the sanctuary.
</p><p>The map's images include the times and dates they were taken and the depths where they were shot. Those images were taken in three ways: using a camera sled, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and a submersible occupied by a person.
</p><p>A team of staff members and students from IfAME go out throughout the year to collect the images and videos.
</p><p>The website started four years ago; the new version is the third incarnation. The site will be updated as new data becomes available.
</p><p>Version 3.5 is set to launch before the end of 2010.
