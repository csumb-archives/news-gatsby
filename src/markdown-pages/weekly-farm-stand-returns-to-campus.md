<p>CSU Monterey Bay Dining Services is teaming up with the campus Farm Club to bring a weekly farm stand to campus throughout the fall.
</p><p>Operating near the library from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. every Tuesday until late November, the farm stand is open to the campus community and the community-at-large. It’s part of a commitment to sustainability and healthy lifestyles. “The purpose of bringing a farm stand to campus is to provide students with the opportunity to purchase fresh local and organic produce,” said Tyler McBrian, retail manager for campus dining services. This year, campus dining handed over running the stand to the campus Farm Club. Each Tuesday, a student member of the Farm Club will purchase produce directly from local farmers; it will be delivered to campus for sale that day at the stand.?“We plan to pick different growers to feature at the stand, with their stories and recipes using produce that we’re selling,” said Stephanie Yee, a member of the Farm Club. Students can use their meal plan to pay for their produce by purchasing vouchers at Peet’s. Customers can also pay with cash. CSUMB joins a growing number of colleges that are finding that campus farmers markets are a great fit, tapping into students' interest in sustaining the planet and eating a healthy diet. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSUMBFARMclub?hc_location=timeline">Follow the Farm Club on Facebook</a> <a href="https://csumb.edu/dining">Learn more about campus dining services</a>
