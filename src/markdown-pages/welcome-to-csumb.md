</p><p><strong>University holds summer orientation sessions</strong>
</p><p>A generation ago, college orientation was a perfunctory event, focusing on getting the new students registered for classes.
</p><p>Now, universities, including CSU Monterey Bay, have made this annual ritual an important part of the student experience, and include a separate program for parents.
</p><p>Otter orientation was held in July, with events meant to showcase the campus to students who will enter in the fall. All six sessions – two for transfer students, four for incoming freshmen and their families – were at the maximum capacity of 200 students. Freshmen sessions also drew more than 300 family members.
</p><p>The sessions were designed to ensure a successful transition to CSUMB. Students had the opportunity to meet with an adviser, register for classes, learn about the university and how to get involved with campus life. They were introduced to campus organizations, student government, living and learning opportunities, Greek life, outdoor recreation and intramural sports. And they got information on academic services, such as tutoring and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center.
</p><p>At a session called Beyond the Classroom: Getting Connected, Kelly Mailly, the campus coordinator of leadership development, told students, "What you do outside of class is what will set you apart when you finish here." Student government adviser Ajamu Lamumba echoed that. "This is about involvement," he told a group of transfer students.
</p><p>New students will have the opportunity to make connections and get involved during Otter Days Aug. 20-29, and at the Club Showcase, which will be held in early September.
