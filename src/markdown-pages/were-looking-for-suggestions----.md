<p>In partnership with local TV station KCBA, the university plans to produce a weekly program, “Campus to Community,” starting in January. </p><p>The plan is to produce short segments that highlight campus programs, faculty research, student success, campus life and CSUMB's presence in the community. Each program will consist of several segments.
</p><p>The segments will be produced by University Communications staff members, with help from student assistants. While we already have lots of ideas for stories, we’re asking the campus community to share their ideas for people, stories or programs that you think should be highlighted.
</p><p>Post your story ideas and contact information on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/csumb.edu/spreadsheets/d/1Do2fWT9w&#45;NSl7nzP494THZOjB7ZKSSXSEYkRSieBEwU/edit?usp=sharing">Google doc.</a>
