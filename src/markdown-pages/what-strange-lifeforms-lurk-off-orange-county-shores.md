<p>Hundreds of feet beneath the ocean, but not far off the Laguna Beach coast, deep-water rockfish take shelter from the dark in the arms of a sea star. They're among thousands of images captured with the help of a robotic submarine as part of a survey of sea life up and down the California coast. James Lindholm, a fish ecologist and professor at CSU Monterey Bay, is leading the survey. â€“ <em>Orange County Register</em>, Feb. 13, 2012
