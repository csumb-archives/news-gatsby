<h3>
  Huge Genome Reveals Sequence Adaptations in Key Wound Healing and Genome
  Stability Genes Tied to Cancer Protection
</h3>
<p>
  <b>SEASIDE, Ca., February 25, 2019 –</b> An international team of researchers,
  that includes CSUMB <a href="sns">School of Natural Sciences</a> assistant
  professor Nathaniel Jue, has published a major scientific step to
  understanding the biology of the great white shark, and how it’s genetic
  makeup may be useful in treatment of human conditions.
</p>
<p>
  The<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/13/1819778116">
    research findings</a
  >, published Feb. 19 in the journal
  <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, </i>describe the first
  time the entire genome of the white shark has been decoded in detail, and
  represent a breakthrough for scientists studying evolutionary adaptations in
  the marine environment.
</p>
<p>
  In assisting in the assembly and analysis of both its genome and transcriptome
  (the set of genes active in the white shark), Jue’s work provided a key
  contribution to generating the first major genetic resources for this species.
</p>
<p>
  Decoding the white shark’s genome revealed not only its huge size,
  one-and-a-half times the size of the human genome, but also a plethora of
  genetic changes that could be behind the evolutionary success of large-bodied
  and long-lived sharks.
</p>
<p>
  “Generating this genome sequence, and the predictions of all the genes and
  other components in it, let us study the unique genetic mechanisms that
  underlie the biology of this amazing animal,” said Nathaniel Jue, associate
  professor at CSUMB’s School of Natural Sciences and a co-author of the study.
  "Through comparisons with other species, genetic adaptations in the white
  sharks can help us better understand how important processes like the repair
  of damaged DNA, which is a key issue in cancer biology, may function in other
  organisms including humans..”

  “Decoding the white shark genome is providing science with a new set of keys
  to unlock lingering mysteries about these feared and misunderstood predators -
  why sharks have thrived for some 500 million years, longer than almost any
  vertebrate on earth” said Salvador Jorgensen, a senior research scientist at
  the Monterey Bay Aquarium and co-author of the study.
</p>
<p>
  The completed genome was compared to those from several other animals,
  including the whale shark and humans. The findings suggest that sharks have
  evolved to be more resilient than we are to cancers, and to several other
  age-related diseases that typically affect humans.
</p>
<p>
  The study adds another big piece in the ongoing puzzle to uncover the secrets
  of these important predators. The authors of the study say that, aside from
  the potentially significant biomedical insights, this kind of information
  builds on our understanding of white sharks as complex, highly adapted
  creatures and adds to what we need to know to manage their populations better.
