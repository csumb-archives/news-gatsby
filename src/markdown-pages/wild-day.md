<p>With an assist from CSUMB, the PTA and community volunteers, the students and staff of Marina del Mar Elementary School recently celebrated the things they value most - family, literacy and community.
</p><p>On Sept. 23, 50 tents were erected on the school field to provide a "camping" experience for students to enjoy while reading and being read to.
</p><p>Among the volunteer readers were CSUMB Interim President Diane Cordero de Noriega and her husband, Carlos Noriega, a member of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District board. The husband-and-wife team read Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" in Spanish and English, much to the delight of the children. Sally the Otter, the university's mascot, signed autographs and was a big hit with the youngsters.
</p><p>A group of CSUMB service learners arrived at 5:30 a.m. to set up the tents and stayed all day. They helped with various activities, including face painting, relay races and crafts. The class, taught by Scott Waltz, has formed a partnership with Marina del Mar. The university students get experience working at the school; in return, the youngsters receive the benefits of many mentors to enrich their educational experience.
</p><p>Also arriving before daybreak were several volunteers from Company C, 229th MIB, under the command of Capt. Jeremy Dobos, The soldiers spent the day with the children, reading and assisting with the activities.
</p><p>This year's event had an added focus - to raise money for a school in the area affected by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The effort raised $1,500.
