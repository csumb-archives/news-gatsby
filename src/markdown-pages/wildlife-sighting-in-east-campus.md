<p>A black bear was spotted on Trenton Court in Frederick Park I Sunday night.
</p><p>Anyone who spots a bear is asked to call the University Police Department as soon as it is safe to do so. Call 911 in an emergency; otherwise, for non&#45;emergencies, call <a href="tel:831&#45;655&#45;0268">831&#45;655&#45;0268</a>.
</p><p>The bear was seen about 9:40 p.m. rummaging through trash cans. It ran out of the rear of the court and into a wooded area.
</p><p>According to an official with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, bears are looking for food and water due to the drought. A garbage can, bowl of pet food, or an unclean or uncovered barbecue grill can attract the animals.
</p><p>To protect people and bears, residents should not feed the animals or leave food or garbage where they are accessible.
</p><p><strong>If you encounter a bear in your neighborhood:</strong>
</p><p>• Do not run; instead, face the animal, make noise and try to appear as large as possible
</p><p>• DO NOT approach the animal
</p><p>• Allow the bear plenty of room to pass or withdraw
</p><p>• Once you are a safe distance away, encourage the bear to leave by banging pots and pans or making other loud noises
</p><p>• If attacked, fight back
</p><p>• Keep a close watch on children, and teach them what to do if they encounter a bear
