</p><p><strong>Folk group performs at World Theater Oct. 23</strong>
</p><p><strong><em> </em></strong>Folk music returns to the stage at California State University, Monterey Bay's World Theater on Oct. 23 when the Woods Tea Company performs. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
</p><p>Much of the music the band plays has its roots in the 19th century, but there's lots of musical dialogue during their performances, along with tight four-part harmony.
</p><p>The band's music is an amalgam of lively folk, Celtic, sea chanties, Irish jigs and bluegrass. And humor is as much a part of the performance as are the many instruments they juggle.
</p><p>They're not strictly traditional, though many of the tunes they play – such as the 19th century sea chanties – are musical artifacts. They play music they like, whether that music's roots are in Appalachia, the Dust Bowl, or Ireland and Scotland, and they interpret it with originality.
</p><p>The band started in the early 1980s. Mike Lussen, who joined in 1983, is the longest tenured member. He sings, plays banjo, guitar, bodhran and bouzouki. Howard Wooden handles the bass as well as guitar and vocals. Tom MacKenzie plays hammered dulcimer, banjo, guitar, ukulele and keyboard, and sings. The newest member, Patti Casey, brings her skills on the guitar, penny whistle, flute, French Canadian clogboard and vocals.
</p><p>The group is nothing if not versatile. They were once hired by the Canadian embassy to play Newfoundland music in Boston, they've played their share of tall ships festivals – offering the obligatory chanties and mariner tunes – and they have played Woody Guthrie festivals in the Midwest.
</p><p>After building a solid reputation in New England – the group is based in Vermont – the Woods Tea Company started touring nationwide. Notable performances include New York's Lincoln Center (twice), the Chautauqua Institute (three times), appearances on PBS and National Public Radio. They perform about 120 shows a year.
</p><p>Folk Music Quarterly said: "Sidestepping pretension and going for the grit, this New England group gives a lusty performance every time."
</p><p>Tickets are $10 to $40. A buy-one-ticket, get-one-free offer, limited to the first 100 tickets sold, is available for all shows this season with a limit of two free tickets per customer. For more information, visit the web at csumb.edu/worldtheater or call the box office at 582-4580.
</p><p>Concertgoers can have a pre-show dinner in the Otter Bay Restaurant, located next to the theater. A *prix fixe *All American Yankee menu will be offered for $19.95. Dinner reservations can be made by calling the box office.
