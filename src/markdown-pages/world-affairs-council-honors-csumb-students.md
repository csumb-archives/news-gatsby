<p>The World Affairs Council of the Monterey Bay Area has awarded scholarships to two students from California State University, Monterey Bay.
</p><p>The CSUMB students were among six who received $1,000 Singleton Scholarships, recognizing their interest in international affairs. The students were nominated by their professors, and then submitted resumes, recommendations and personal statements. The WAC scholarship committee made the final decisions.
</p><p>Scholarship winners from CSUMB:
</p><p>• <strong>Brianna Skinner</strong> – A Social and Behavioral Studies major, Skinner expects to graduate in May and intends to pursue a master’s degree in Spanish and become an educator. The award helped her participate in CSUMB’s <a href="http://news.csumb.edu/news/2014/jun/17/students&#45;travel&#45;spain&#45;summer&#45;school">summer program in Spain</a>.
</p><p>“She is a remarkable student; talented, organized and with an enviable view of the world and world cultures,” said Skinner’s mentor Dr. Juan J. Gutierrez, who runs the program in Spain.
</p><p>• <strong>Jacob Taylor</strong> – A senior Global Studies major, Taylor is interested in geopolitical analysis and the geopolitics of energy security. At CSUMB, he’s vice president of Sigma Iota Rho, an honors organization focused on world affairs.
</p><p>His plans after graduation are still taking shape and may include a job in the technology sector, or foreign service. He’s also contemplating graduate school.
</p><p>The students – from Monterey Peninsula College and the Monterey Institute of International Studies as well as CSUMB – were honored at a luncheon on Sept. 30 at Rancho Canada Golf Club in Carmel.
</p><p>Since 2002, 15 CSUMB students have earned WAC scholarships.
</p><p>The Singleton Scholarships are made possible by contributions from members of the <a href="http://www.wacmb.org/WACMB/WACMB&#45;Home&#45;Page.html">World Affairs Council of the Monterey Bay.</a>
