<p>Dr. Stephanie Anne Johnson, professor of Visual and Public Art, was awarded a writing residency in Atlanta last fall. During that time, she wrote a second play, <em>Mrs. Reiff and The Counterfeit Shop</em>.

This autobiographical play about the relationship between a black teenager and a Holocaust survivor was presented to a standing&#45;room&#45;only audience at the East Bay Jewish Community Center in January.

She co&#45;curated the Black Love exhibit at the JanRae Gallery in Oakland, recently served as a juror for The Art of Living Black, and was a review panelist for the San Francisco Art Commission.
