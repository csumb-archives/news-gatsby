  <b>SEASIDE, Calif., May 1, 2020</b> - CSU Monterey Bay has joined 14
  California State University campuses in piloting an online portal to support
  students’ personal growth, academic success and overall well-being.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://you.csumb.edu/">YOU@CSUMB</a> is available 24 hours a day,
  seven days a week, to provide resources and content to enhance academic
  success, career preparedness, physical and mental health, and connection to
  campus. Students create a completely confidential account with their campus
  credentials to use the portal.
</p>
<p>
  While not meant to replace one-on-one services, the portal can be a great
  resource for students as they navigate their academic journey, said Jessica
  López, outreach lead for CSUMB’s
  <a href="https://csumb.edu/pgcc/">Personal Growth &amp; Counseling Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  “Students can find resources to support their well-being and address new
  challenges created by COVID-19, including articles on social distancing,
  student loans, getting the most from remote learning, and how to cope with
  anxiety,” López said.
</p>
<p>
  Content can be customized based on students’ personal interests and needs.
  Students take quizzes, called reality checks, to assess how they are doing
  academically, emotionally, and socially. Once they complete the reality check,
  they are given feedback and directed to campus resources for additional
  support.
</p>
<p>
  The portal is primarily a resource for students, but staff and faculty may
  also log in and encourage their students to use the portal to cope with stress
  and enhance personal growth, Lopez said.
